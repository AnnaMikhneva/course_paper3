['本研究测试Yuan在1998 提出关于以中文为第二语言的英语母语人士对monomorphemic自己（ziji）和polymorphemic他自己（taziji）以参数重设理论来解读。这些第二语言学习者对于polymorphemic他自己（taziji）在语言中出现的位置和中文母语人士对中文的使用相似。尽管如此，从第二语言学习者得到的研究结果也指出；monomorphemic自己（ziji）可以出现在中文语法中的子句内和子句外。然而初学和中级学习者对于monomorphemic自己（ziji）的使用却仅限于子句内。这种不对称的表现存在于语言习得的早期，但却会随着学习阶段增长而消失。Yuan所提出的全转移/全存取（Full Transfer / Ful Access）假设有可能应用在参数重设上。尽管如此，从第二语言学习者接近母语人士的表现，参数重设可能实际上是一种将第二语言重新调整以适应第一语言；monomorphemic 自己（ziji）可能被误析为英文中的代名词。在成人第二语言习得过程中未能被解读的语句特质将变得不能被学会的可能性应被排除；特别是在Hawkins and Hattori （2006）和Tsimpli and Dimitrakopoulou（2007）。'],1,0

Voornaamwoorde se deiktiese eienskappe veroorsaak verder dat hulle nie aan kinders gemodeleer kan word sonder om moontlike verwarring te veroorsaak nie; kinders moet luister na die gebruik van voornaamwoorde in die taal van ander sprekers om vertroud te raak met die korrekte gebruik daarvan (Cole, Oshima-Takane, en Yaremko 1994: 115).']",1,0

['提要： 会话分析（Conversation Analysis）的研究对象是人们的交际活动，包括日常的会话和机构性交谈。课堂教学是机构性交谈的一种，因此从会话分析创立之初，就有研究者按照会话分析的理论和方法来对课堂交流进行研究。本文从课堂交互研究和课堂学习研究两个方面概述了会话分析路向的课堂教学研究，包括主要的课题及其成果。在课堂交互活动研究方面，研究者从话轮转换、序列结构、会话补救三个方面深入挖掘课堂交互活动的特点。早期的一些研究较多关注于教师主导的课堂活动，描述教师在话轮分配上的主导地位；新近的研究开始关注其他类型的课堂活动或教师主导的课堂中其他类型的活动中的话轮替换形式。在课堂教学活动序列结构方面，会话分析路向的课堂研究显示了它微观分析的优势，细致而深入地描述 IRE 在课堂教学中的具体实现过程，准确地描写了后续话轮的作用。纠正学生的错误是课堂教学中的重要一环，会话分析路向的课堂研究表明，把课堂教学中的补救或纠错与日常会话的补救做简单的对比是不恰当的。课堂的补救行为跟 IRE 序列有密切的关联，并且研究还发现课堂上的补救行为与课堂教学环境有很大关联，跟课堂教学中不同阶段的特定教学目标密切相关。此外，会话分析路向的习得研究在很多方面丰富和补充了已有的第二语言习得研究。它最大的优势在于利用真实的语料来揭示学习者的理解和学习是否、何时、怎样、为什么产生。同时由于会话分析导向的习得研究把学习看作是一种社会交流活动，突破了大多数 SLA 研究把学习当作是个体认知活动的局限。我们认为，会话分析注重真实语料以及交互者视角的特点给汉语作为第二语言的课堂研究提供了有益的借鉴。'],1,0

['抽象 本文在韵律音系学理论框架下对福州方言的粘附成分与粘附组进行分析。在前人针对不同语言的粘附成分与粘附组所做探讨的基础上，本文从构词句法功能与音系表现两个方面，对福州方言的相关材料进行了全面分析，揭示了福州方言粘附成分与其他语言粘附成分在构词句法与音系上的共同特征。福州方言的两类粘附组在音系表现上存在不对称的现象，然而，与其他韵律单位相比，福州方言粘附组作为一个整体仍然具有十分特殊的音系表现，这为福州方言中粘附组这一韵律单位的设立提供了动因与证据。此外，福州方言的粘附成分可以选择韵律层级中位置高于韵律词的韵律单位作为宿主，这对韵律音系学理论中的严格分层假设构成了巨大的挑战。这一挑战利用弱化的严格分层假设即可得到合理的解释，而无需将粘附组这一韵律单位排除在韵律层级之外。'],1,0

['鼻韻尾-n與-ng的混淆在詞典與韻書裏已有跡可循：本文舉出的36個例証顯示-in／-ing與-en／-eng兩組最不穩定；而目前台北與新加坡兩地的實際語音裏的變化則是以-in變向-ing，-eng變向-en進展得最快。捲舌音與不捲舌音的混淆在中古音裏已不乏其例，而自中古音以降，中原音韻，1932系統，1963-85系統各階段之間，讀音亦多有變更。文中的104個字例只有筆者在短期內搜尋所得；實際上的字數當遠多於此。此處104個例証可說是北京一地的變化。在北京以外，台灣的國語，新加坡的華語，及中國大陸許多地區的普通話裏，捲舌正迅速地消失。這種現象可能促使捲舌音在北京一地的變化步伐加速。'],1,0

Results indicate RL anticipatory movements of the tongue dorsum in C 1 C 2 V sequences, anticipatory movements toward V began on C 1 in 30 % of the cases. In VC 1 C 2 sequences, the tongue apex began RL anticipatory movements toward C 2 during the steady-state vowel segment in approximately 44% of the cases. Perturbations of tongue movement related to labial closures and subsequent oral pressure build up was observed. The articulatory feature tense/lax did not vary systematically with the amount and extent of coarticulatory RL effects.

['Pylkkäne把施用结构分为高低两层，为处理施用论元的跨语言语法行为提供了新的视角和分析方法。然而，其对低层施用词素ApplL的处理方法存在多重根本性问题，其中最显著的问题是在语义上把ApplL 当作VP的论元，但在句法上却当作VP的内部成分。这显然与论元关系所呈现出的句法-语义高度一致性相违背。针对这些问题，本文提出了新的解决方案，设定了ApplL的两个功能：1)引进施用论元，并界定施用论元和受事论元之间的所有者和被所有者关系；2)核查V所指称的事件是否允准所有者关系的转移。这两大功能决定了ApplL和V之间不可能存在论元关系或修饰关系，而只能把两种独立的语法信息直接叠加，共同构成相关句法成分的核心内容。令ApplL类比φ特征，V类比T，两者组合构成V-ApplL。在句法语义规则限制下，组合结果既能解释低层施用论元的语法语义行为，又能避免Pylkkänen理论的弊病。'],1,0

['提要 由於漢字的內部結構複雜，但部首卻有一定的認知規律可循，因此，部首教學就成為漢字教學導入的一大利器。因此，本研究進行以認知學習理論為基礎的部首多媒體教學設計，考量學習者的認知負擔，以寓教於樂的方式，袪除對漢字的畏懼感，有效建立學習者的部首意識。由於部首對於絕大多數初學漢字的學習者是一個全新的概念建構，我們要從功能類比部首是相當於印歐語系(Indo-European family) 文字的字根 (base word) 概念，是帶有主要語義成分的最小單位。本文統計視聽華語（一）（二）冊教材中的614個生字之部首頻率，再對照常用字頻部首頻率，並參酌黃沛榮 (2001) 從漢字的辨識、書寫與使用三個角度來評估部首的學習價值，綜合列出100個具有優先學習價值的部首，作為多媒體教學設計之主要範疇。規劃出符合五項認知歷程的單元教學，包括：（一）直觀圖形，聯結形符。（二）解構字碼，凝聚概念。（三）鞏固部首位置及組合結構，加強形近辨識。（四）語義彙整，加強義近區辨。（五）綜合運用，融會貫通。'],1,0

"['Namate die sosiale wending in vertaalstudie toenemend inslag gevind het, het navorsers begin fokus op die menslike agente betrokke by vertalings, en op die sosiale voorwaardes wat in die reele wereld geld. Navorsers het al hoe meer die waarde begin insien van meer prosesgeorienteerde navorsing in vertaalstudie. Die Franse sosioloog Bruno Latour se Akteur-Netwerk-Teorie (oftewel ANT) laat die navorser die objek van navorsing nie as substantiewe verskynsel beskou nie, maar as ’n netwerk van verhoudinge deur ’n studie te maak van die betrokke mense en objekte (akteurs en aktante) en die wisselwerking tussen hulle. Binne hierdie teoretiese raamwerk is etnografie of ’n etnometodologie besonder gepas omdat dit die navorser nader bring aan die beleefde ervaring. Opvoedkundige tolking, of mondelinge tolking in klaskamers vir niegehoorgestremde studente, is ’n innoverende toepassing van tolking, en ook ’n grootliks onontginde kennisveld. Dit is as taalmodus by die nuwe Taalbeleid van die Universiteit Stellenbosch (US 2016) ingesluit ter wille van die praktiese uitvoerbaarheid van meertaligheid. In die praktyk is opvoedkundige tolking egter dikwels onderhewig aan onrealistiese verwagtinge, en die waarde daarvan in ’n opvoedkundige konteks bly kontensieus. Empiriese navorsing in getolkte klasse binne ’n raamwerk van ANT kan moontlik lig werp op die wisselwerking tussen die onderskeie faktore in opvoedkundige tolking en hoe hulle funksioneer. Hierdie artikel ondersoek die waarde van ANT na aanleiding van data wat gedurende veldwerk in 36 getolkte lesings aan die Universiteit Stellenbosch ingesamel is. Dit toon hoe ’n etnometodologie binne die teoretiese raamwerk van ANT die navorser in staat stel om verder en dieper te beskryf; om gebeure, verwantskappe, verskynsels en situasies wat tot nog toe onvertel was, aan die lig te bring. Uiteindelik kan hierdie bevindings waardevol wees vir taalimplementering aan die Universiteit Stellenbosch en die soeke na prakties uitvoerbare meertaligheidspraktyke aan Suid-Afrikaanse universiteite.']",1,0

['本文的主旨在於討論漢語名詞組可以有獨立於句子的時制，稱名詞時制。文中我先討論漢語名詞時制的三種現象，並且提出形式語言學的分析。我採取階段分析（Quine 1960），主張漢語名詞組可視為一個主個體（host-individual），而該主個體是由許多空間階段（temporal stages）所組成。漢語名詞時制現象是由於每個空間階段可以被不同名詞謂語修飾，而修飾關係必須發生在主個體的生存時段（lifetime span）內。除此之外，本文主張漢語時制中指涉詞能夠量化空間階段，並且還取特定的時間階段做名詞的時制解讀，無須訴諸於句子時制。這樣的分析能夠解釋為什麼帶有時制指涉詞的名詞組能夠容易得到名詞時制的語意。'],1,0

['本文研究漢語中數－類詞（數詞“一”+分類詞）在話語層次上的作用。文中用統計數字說明數－類詞的使用與一系列其他詞法句法結構有一定的聯繫。如，(1)帶有數－類詞的名詞詞組中其他修飾語的數量明顯高於不帶數－類詞的名詞詞組；(2)數－類詞在存現句中的使用頻率極高；(3)數－類詞多用於肯定句中；(4)數－類詞多用於被置於前景的語句中。根據這些特點，作者提出，數－類詞在話語層次上有前後景設置的作用，即把名詞片語設為前景，置于明顯的地位。本項研究還表明，數－類詞具有前後景設置作用這一看法，與以往研究中提出的“數－類詞的使用取決於名詞在主題中的重要性”的觀點相比，能夠為數－類詞的使用提供更好的解釋。本文通過對數-類詞不同功能的綜合觀察，指出數－類詞在話語層次上的前後景設置的作用屬於Tomlin (1985)提出的“語言結構的語用功能”。這種看法，也完全符合Givon (1991)提出的語言符號的數量原則，即，越重要的資訊，入碼使用的符號也就越多。'],1,0

['本篇研究主要是從語誤語料庫來探討中文詞彙置換的語意關係。從中文詞彙語誤的語意代換中可以大致上證實英語及德語的現象，由此可見跨語言間相似的情形。這其中的相似之處在於詞彙置換語誤通常是與語意的關連度有關。目標與語誤詞彙（target-error words）之間會有相似的語意特徵或者呈現語意學裡分類架構中的關聯性。從五種分類架構中來看，語意並列（coordinate）是最常見的情況，再來就是關聯性（association），對比關係（contrastive）則是最少見的。這樣的研究結果支持了對於兩個詞彙互相置換時，彼此都有一定程度上相似的語意特徵或是共同擁有在情境上的某些特質的證論。中文裡的詞彙錯誤總體來說與國外一些跨語言研究中所得到的結論大致吻合。也就是說，詞彙裡的兩個詞目（lemma）之間的語意關聯即是構成置換錯誤的主因。從中文語誤語料的分布類別可以清楚的看出心理語言學及神經語言學在語言產製時直接及透明的歷程，與詞彙選擇呈現獨立進行的過程。'],1,0

['在近年所谓“第三次古音学大辩论”中，学界围绕《广雅疏证》“一声 之转”曾有不少争论，焦点在于王念孙对音读关系的判断是否合理。 王氏的同源研究模式承自戴震。戴氏《方言疏证》、段玉裁《说文解字 注》等同样标记了大量“一声之转”。本文全面辑录上述三种训诂著作 中的转语材料，分析当中的声纽接触类型，联系乾嘉时期的古声纽学 说，对各家的审音标准进行考察。文章认为钱大昕的古声纽考证结论 在当时尚未被普遍接受，段、王二氏都采纳了戴震的声转说，但又分 别做了调整，即对“正转”和“变转”各有侧重。本文还讨论了戴、 段、王在训诂实践中对文献证据和音韵理论的权衡，分析了转语材料 中声纽接触行为与声转说之间的隔阂。本研究有助于釐清以往对“一 声之转”的误解，也可以为重建传统古音学术史提供参考。'],1,0

['提要： 国际汉语教材既是外国学习者学习汉语知识的工具，也是了解中国的一个重要窗口。教材中的人物设置及性别刻板印象会对学习者产生潜移默化的影响。本文从人物设定、作者性别、角色职业分布和角色职业出现的频次等方面着手，对较有代表性的五套国际汉语综合教材进行了数据统计和文本分析，发现国际汉语教材中确实存在对中国男女角色的性别刻板印象。文章分析总结了国际汉语教材中出现中国男女性别刻板印象的一些原因，并对如何消解教材中的中国性别角色刻板印象提出了几点建议。'],1,0

['抽象 河北邢臺話的動後時體詞「了 1 」有兩個語音形式：強變體「咾 [lau]」和弱變體「囒 [læ͊]」，二者在很大程度上是條件變體。經考察，漢語「了 1 」的使用受制於謂語的整體屬性（現實性狀況、話語地位）和謂語的構件屬性（賓語類型、動詞類型）兩大類語法因素，而邢臺話「了 1 」兩變體的分佈同樣受制於這些因素：謂語的整體屬性決定「了 1 」兩變體分佈的基本格局，謂語的構件屬性決定既定的「咾」或「囒」可換為另一變體的特殊情況。各項語法因素制約「了 1 」變體的作用強度存在一個優先等級「現實性狀況＞話語地位＞賓語類型＞動詞類型」。最重要的是，「了 1 」兩變體的分佈呈現出一個顯著的態勢：某語法環境中「了 1 」的句法自由度越高，則越排斥強變體「咾」、越接受弱變體「囒」。由此可對其他方言「了 1 」變體的分佈態勢提出多項理論預測，該現象也反映出北方漢語的「了 1 」是一個複雜的語法異質語素。本文「了 1 」的語法分析範式應有助於深入發掘漢語方言「了 1 」語素的事實，並推進對多項理論問題的認識。'],1,0

['抽象 霍爾語是四川境內較少人知的語群，屬於漢藏語系羌語支嘉戎語組。本文首度詳細介紹中部霍爾語格西話動詞的時－體範疇。保守的嘉戎語組語言，動詞均採「三分式」時－體系統，一般以方向前綴區別完整體與非完整體，以不同的詞幹標記過去與非過去時。相較於這種保守的形態格局，格西話動詞的時－體系統有數項重要的創新：（一）動詞詞幹交替大幅簡化，標註時間的功能基本喪失；（二）方向前綴從體標記轉成「相對過去時」標記，可通用的相對過去前綴 də- 開始逐步取代其他前綴，且有聚焦於動作結果的延伸功能；（三）以贅語式造出一般非完整體及「持續體」構造。這些重要的創新既源自內部衍變的機制，也明顯受到本地主流藏語的接觸影響。'],1,0
"['This paper aims to explain the literacy system in Sumbawa (BS), which includes the sound system (phoneme); grapheme system (letter); and phoneme distribution. Methodologically, data collection uses skilled methods, see (using written data), and introspection. The collected data was analyzed using intralingual method. The results showed that there were 29 phonemes in the BS, ie 10 vowels (/ i /, / I /, / u /, / e /, / E /, / A› /, / o /, / A² /, / a /, and / A /) and 19 consonants (/ p /, / b /, / t /, / d /, / c /, / j /, / k /, / g /, / q /, / s /, /Â\xa0 /, / r /, / l /, / w /, and / y /).hh /, / m /, / n /, / A± /, /Â\xa0 The ten vowel phonemes are written with 6 letters (graphemes), namely (representing / i / and / I /), , (representing / e / and / E /), , , , and (representing / a / and / A /). As for the 19 consonant phonemes each written with letters a number of existing phonemes. The vowel sound of BS can occupy the initial, middle, and final position of the word, except / e / (as [e]) can not occupy the final position, while / u / never appears in the ultima syllabe which ends with consonant.

"[""The paper addresses the problem of the temporal integration of information in vowel perception and the nature of this information. One-formant stimuli with F ∗ = F1 and F ∗ = F2 , two-formant F 1, F 2 stimuli and stimuli with a jumping formant produced as trains of alternating F 1 - and F 2- pulses occurring on different proportions were used in vowel identification experiments. The response distributions corresponding to two-formant stimuli and to stimuli with a jumping formant were approximated as weighted sums of two ‘basic’ distribution. P 1 and P 2 , corresponding to one-formant stimuli. An increase in the proportion of F 2-pulses in stimuli with a jumping formant was accompanied by a systematic increase in the P 2 component in the response distribution. Stimuli with a jumping formant did not elicit the phonemic responses typical for two-formant stimuli with the same F 1 and F 2 frequencies. The data suggest that the running identification of the stimulus is integrated temporally. Der vorliegende Artikel behandelt das Problem der zeitlichen Integration der Information bei der Vokalperzeption sowie der Natur dieser Information. Stimuli aus einem Formanten (F ∗ = F1, F ∗ = F2) , zwei Formanten ( F 1, F 2) und springenden Formanten, der mit Hilfe von in unterschiedlichem Verhältnis alternierenden F 1- und F 2- Impulsen Formantenverläufe simuliert, wurden für Vokal-Indentifikationsexperimente verwendet. Die Verteilungen der Hörerurteile bezüglich der Stimuli mit zwei Formanten unde dem springenden Formanten konnten als gewichtete Summen zweier den Stimuli mit einem Formanten entsprechenden ‘Basis’-Verteilungen ( P 1 und P ) approximiert werden. Der Anstieg des Anteils von F 2-Impulsen in Stimuli mit springendem Formanten wurde begleitet von einer systematischen Zunahme der P 2-Komponente in den Urteilen. Die Stimuli mit springendem Formanten ergeben keinen Aufschluss über die phonemischen Hörer-Reaktionen, die für Zwei-Formanten-Stimuli derselben F 1- und F2-Frequenzen typisch sind. Die vorliegenden Daten unterstützen die These einer temporalen Integration der Ergebnisse aus der fortlaufenden Identifikation des Stimulus. Cet article concerne le probléme de l'intégration temporalle de l'information dans la perception des voyelles ainsi que la nature de cette information. Des stimuli caractérisés, soit par un formant, avec F ∗ = F1 et F ∗ = F2 , soit par 2 formants, F 1 et F 2, soit encore par un formant évolutif produit par trains d'impulsions alternantes de F 1 et F 2, en proportions différentes, ont été utilisés dans des expériences d'identification de voyelles. Les distributions de réponses correspondant aux stimuli à 2 formants et à ceux avec formant évolutif ont été approchées par des sommes pondérées de deux distributions “de base”, P 2 et P 2 , correspondant aux stimuli à un seul formant. Un accroissement de la proportion d'impulsions F 2 dans les stimuli à formant évolutif est accompagné d'un accroissement systématique de la composante P 2 de la distribution de réposens. Les stimuli avec formant évolutif n'ont pas suscité les réponses phonémiques caractéristiques des stimuli à 2 formants avec mémes fréquences de F 1 et F 2. Les données suggérent qu'il y a intégration temporelle des résultats du processus d'idenfication continue du stimulus.""]",1,0

"['The analysis of Old Romance geographical names in early South Slavic confirms that the majority of late Proto-Slavic sound changes were still operative in the period of the earliest Old Romance-Slavic language contacts in the Balkan Peninsula and eastern Alps from the second half of the 6th century and the beginning of the 7th century onwards. Phonetic substitutions of the type Rom. *kE, *gE → Sl. *c, *ʒ (Balk. Rom. *Kersu → Sl. *Cersъ, Balk. Rom. *Gīla → Sl. *Ʒiĺa) and Rom. *auC → Sl. *ovC (Balk. Rom. *Laurentiu &gt; *Laurenču → Sl. *Lovręčь) point to the fact that the first palatalization of velars as well as the monophthongization of the inherited diphthongs were no longer among the ongoing processes. All other late Proto-Slavic sound changes were either still operative or only took place after the borrowing. This is confirmed by the relative chronology of the following set of Romance-Slavic correspondences: simplification of consonant clusters: Rom. *ps → Sl. *s (Balk. Rom. *Apsaru → Sl. *Osorъ), development of prothetic consonants: Rom. *ū- → Sl. *uū- &gt; *vy- (Alp. Rom. *Ūdẹnu → Sl. *(V)ydьnъ), simplification of j-clusters: Rom. *Ci → Sl. *Cʹ (Balk. Rom. *Arsia → Sl. *Orša), delabialization of *o after *r: Rom. *ro → Sl. *ry &gt; *ri (Rom. *Roma → Sl. *Rymъ &gt; *Rimъ), second regressive palatalization of velars (see above Sl. *Cersъ, *Ʒiĺa), rise of nasal vowels: Rom. *ENC, *ONC → Sl. *ęC, *ǫC (Balk. Rom. *Parentiu &gt; *Parenču → Sl. *Poręčь, Balk. Rom. *Karantānu → Sl. *Korǫtanъ), progressive palatalization of velars: Rom. *Ek, *Eg → Sl. *c, *ʒ (Balk. Rom. *Longātẹku → Sl. *Lǫgatьcь), delabialization of *ū1 &gt; *y: Rom. *ū/*o → Sl. *y (Balk. Rom. *Allūviu → Sl. *Olybъ), labialization of *a &gt; *o: Rom. *a → Sl. *o (Balk.

['马来西亚华语中副词“几”的用法较为广泛。从语法化及语言接触的角 度探讨这一用法发现，马来西亚华语“几”的副词用法是受中国南方方 言特别是粤语的影响所致。马来西亚华语副词“几”主要有三种用法： (a)表询问，用于疑问句；(b)表任一程度；(c)表程度高。另外，马来西 亚华语“几+动/形+(一)下”结构用法也很普遍。马来西亚华语“几”的副 词用法的产生与“几”的语法化具有密切关系。“几”从表数量到表程度， 是一个由客观数量到主观程度的演变历程。中国大陆普通话已经没有 程度副词“几”的用法，但是中国南方方言的“几”的这种用法却比较普 遍，尤其是粤语。马来西亚华语“几”的副词用法是受粤语的影响而形 成的，是方言接触的结果，马来西亚华语“几”的副词用法复制了粤语 中“几”的这种用法，是一种语法复制现象。'],1,0

['鼻元音在世界很多语言的语音系统中都是存在的。语音学家和普遍语法学家们一般认为，鼻化演变成为一个元音的区别性特征，经历了「元音鼻化」和「鼻辅音删减」两个先后的历史阶段，即在某个历史阶段鼻辅音韵尾前面的元音被逆向鼻化，接下来鼻辅音韵尾突然脱落，使其前面元音的鼻化成为一个区别性特征。但是，很少有研究用实证的语言数据尤其是语音数据来证明或者证伪这个「两步」假设，因为在很多情况下这个假设已经被看成理所当然。尤其是学者们普遍认为「鼻辅音韵尾脱落」是一个简单的一步到位的变化，而对于它脱落的原因、方式以及具体的过程都很少提及。汉语湘乡方言是老湘语的代表方言，它不仅有丰富的鼻辅音、鼻元音（包括鼻单元音和鼻双元音）和鼻化元音，而且允许口、鼻辅音与鼻元音的自由组合。本文试图对这个方言的元音鼻化现象进行气流分析，并结合其他学者对其它语言中相关现象的研究，来验证鼻元音历史演变的「两步」假设，并重构整个过程。'],1,0

['提要 本文的目的是为了使学生能够更快更好地提高阅读理解的能力，能够利用好汉越词来理解汉语词语。论文考察了汉越词对越南学生在阅读汉语对越南学生的帮助和常常由此引起的偏误，并得出了影响的原因，进而针对这些问题提出了一些教学对策。论文界定了有关汉越词的一些概念，进而在《成语辨析词典》、《汉语俗语词典》、《汉语歇后语辞典》中，随机抽样成语、俗语、歇后语作为引例进行分析。同时，也从《汉语水平词汇与汉字等级大纲》里随机抽样词语来当例句而进行研究和分析汉语词语与汉越词在语义、篇章方面的对应关系。然后，考察了越南学生在阅读汉语过程中，汉越词对汉语词语理解的帮助以及存在的偏误。论文对那些帮助和偏误产生的原因进行了具体分析，并针对这些原因提出具体的教学对策。本文还对利用汉越词在阅读汉语教学以及教材编写方面提出一些建议。希望通过本文的研究和分析可以提高对越南学生的汉语阅读教学效果，提高越南学生学习阅读的效率。本文的研究结论在汉语阅读教学工作中，无论是在课堂教学还是教材编写方面，都会有一定的参考价值。'],1,0

"['提要 華語中的進行貌「在」和持續貌「著」, 在語意上都含有持續的意思, 這種語意特徵一直以來對日籍的華語學習者造成很大的困擾。對日籍華語學習者而言, 日語中表示持續貌的「ている teiru」, 除了可以對應華語進行貌「在」、持續貌「著」, 還能對應華語表達狀態改變的「了」。一對多的對應形式, 使日籍華語學習者在分辨華語動貌標記時, 出現很大的困難。本研究採用雙元理論 (The Two-Component Theory, Smith, Carlota S. 1997. The parameter of aspect . The Netherlands: Springer Netherlands) 作為中日動貌對比分析之理論框架, 討論華語和日語敘事觀點的差異, 以量化和質化分析並行之方式, 檢視10位中級和高級日籍學習者之口語語料, 並與4位母語人士的口語產出進行對比分析, 以探討學習者在使用華語敘事時動貌標記的使用, 以及母語負遷移的影響。研究發現, 學習者的動貌標記偏誤並非源於對動詞語義所蘊含的事件結構認識不清, 而是因為「ている teiru」可以對應到華語的「在」、「著」和「了」, 再加上缺乏前後景的概念而導致偏誤, 因此會有誤代和遺漏的情況發生, 此種狀況在連動句最為明顯。']",1,0

['本文探討粵語兩個表示近似意義的後置副詞“乜滯”和“咁滯”的語法特點，以及它們所組成的框式結構的句法分析。本文認為“乜滯”用來修飾有否定詞的謂語所表示的動作次數和程度，而“咁滯”強調邁向事件自然終結點的過程。這兩個詞原本都是位於動詞短語之上的中心語，不過由於謂語逐步移位的關係，出現在句末的位置。後置副詞和前置副詞組成框式副詞短語，這種短語在句子裡可以重疊，並且高低有序。本文的發現對粵語後置副詞的句法研究和框式結構的理論應該有一定的參考價值。'],1,0

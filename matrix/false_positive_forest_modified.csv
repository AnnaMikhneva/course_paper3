"[""This study examines the syntactical differences between grammaticalized complements and general complements in Mandarin Chinese. Focusing on four directional complements-shang 上 (up), xia 下 (down), qi 起 (rise), and chu 出 (out)-we investigate the grammaticalization of these directional complements in light of image schemata (Talmy 1988, 2000) and aims to review Heine, Claudi & Hunnemeyer's (1991) proposal of grammatical structure. The result shows that the grammaticalization of directional complements can be written as space movement ⇒ space → non-specific space → time → status, which is generally in accordance with the grammatical structure proposed by Heine, Claudi & Hunnemeyer (1991). However, the additional step of space → non-specific space can be observed in the directional complements of modern Chinese.""]",1,0
"['THE ROOT STRUCTURE OF THE rìša TYPE VERBS SummaryThe verbs of Lith. rìša, Latv. risu „to tie” type are East Baltic innovation. They are formed by unifying the vowel i in apophonical roots (C)eiC/(C)CiC or (C)CeC/CC (Bal\xadtic CiC), e.g. Pr. perrēist: senrists. The roots of historical type (C)CeiC must have been formed from primary basic roots by adding one or two enlargements: Cei/Ci + С or CeC/CC + ei/i + C. The roots of these two historical types (with the root vowel e or ei) are mixed and can be distinguished only etymologically.']",1,0

"['There exist systematic sound correspondences in Japanese loan words whose English origins contain a tense or lax vowel followed by a voiceless stop. For English words of the structure (C 1 )V 1 C 2 ({C 3 /v 2 }), the length of Japanese loan word vowels and consonants corresponding to V 1 (tense or lax) and C 2 (voiceless stop) is predicted by the quality of V 1 and any following elements. To test the hypothesis that these correspondences follow from perceptual assimilation, 18 native speakers of Japanese were presented with nonsense words uttered by two native speakers of American English, where C 1 = /g/, V 1 =/ i , i, u , u/, C 2 = /p, t, k/, C 3 = /s, t/ and v 2 = /ə/. The subjects chose which of four katakana representations sounded closest to each stimulus: S(hort)V + S(ingle)C, SV + G(eminate)C, L(ong)V + SC or LV + GC. The response patterns for CVC and CVC/s/ tokens were consistent with the experimental hypothesis in so far as they matched loan word correspondences and correlated with certain durational properties of the stimuli. However, the responses to CVC/t/ and CVCv tokens did not match the existing systematic correspondences, implicating factors other than perceptual assimilation.']",1,0

I more closely compare structural linguistics and J. v. Uexküll’s theories, noting significant differences unmentioned by T. v. Uexküll, leading to the claim that J. v. Uexküll’s theories need further development in relation to cognitive learning. I suggest that learning has a higher status and different conceptualization in a bio- or eco-semiotic approach than it does in structural linguistics. Bateson’s concepts of proto- and deutero-learning are found to be complementary to Jakob von Uexküll’s theory at the intra-specific level, while Hoffmeyer’s notions of semethic interaction and semiotic freedom are useful to describe interspecific relations and semiotic capacities of organisms.']",1,0
"['Abstract This paper describes the complex clause in Boruca, a Chibchan language once spoken in the southern territories on the Pacific coast of Costa Rica. The present study concentrates on the behavior of complex clauses, following a major distinction between paratactic and hypotactic constructions. Paratactic constructions are divided into asyndetic and syndetic constructions. The latter are quite frequent and it is common to find the syndetons: mang , ni , ihchi and ine in the combination of sentences in regular speech. Hypotactic constructions also have asyndetic and syndetic constructions usually functioning as object complements. There is also evidence for reported speech, indirect questions and adverbial clauses (classified at least into seven different types). Key words: asyndesis, complex clause, hypotaxis, parataxis, syndesis .

We argue that this non-de se reading cannot be subsumed under the category of de re , and suggest extending Kuno and Kaburaki's theory of empathy (Kuno & Kaburaki 1977, Kuno 1987) to interpret these readings as indirect de se : namely, that the speaker empathizes with the attitude holder, helping the latter to do self-reference. Applying this idea to other anaphoric expressions like personal pronouns, we obtain a tri - chotomy of attitude reports—de se, de re, and indirect de se, contra the traditional de se and de re distinction.

"[""L'objectif de cette etude est d'examiner le role de l'aspect lexical et de la frequence des formes dans l'input dans la production orale des formes du passe par des enfants suedois (âges de 4 a 9 ans) apprenants du francais langue seconde (L2) en immersion. Le role de la frequence dans l'input est souvent neglige dans les etudes sur l'influence de l'aspect lexical tout comme les caracteristiques specifiques des verbes le sont dans les etudes consacrees a l'influence de la frequence des formes. L'analyse de 21 verbes dans l'input puis dans la production des cinq enfants durant les deux premieres annees d'exposition au francais montre un recoupement entre les deux facteurs. Bien que les enfants produisent la plupart des verbes selon leur aspect lexical, les frequences type et d'occurrence dans l'input permettent d'expliquer a la fois le marquage correct du passe ainsi que la variation que l'on trouve dans les groupes de verbes etudies.

Abstract: The aim of this study is to investigate the role of lexical aspect and input frequency in Swedish children's production of past tense form in spoken L2 French. The children are between 4 and 9 years old and learners of French by immersion in a French school in Sweden. The role of input frequency has often been overlooked in studies on the influence of lexical aspect as well as specific verb characteristics in studies on input frequency. The analysis of 21 verbs in the input and in the production of the five children during the two first years of exposure to French shows that the two factors overlap. Although the children produce most of the verbs as expected from the lexical aspect, type and token frequency in the input explain both the correct past tense marking and the variation found in the group of verbs under investigation. The results confirm the predictions from a usage-based approach, that learners develop their grammar from their experience of input.""]",1,0

"['Abstract This paper aims to explain the formation of the kě and kě yǐ constructions in archaic Chinese. We analyze a number of examples from the pre-Qin era to refute previous hypotheses that the kě construction is formed by adding kě to a notional passive, fronting the object in an active sentence including kě , or solely by reanalysis. Subsequently, a verb-moving-backward hypothesis is proposed: kě is used in the underlying structure ‘ V - O ’ + kě to comment on an already known proposition ‘ V - O ’, then V is moved to the end to avoid the top-heavy problem. Similarly, this hypothesis also accounts for the kě yǐ construction: kě in the underlying structure ‘ yǐ - X - V - Y ’ + kě is to comment on the serial verb structure ‘ yǐ - X - V - Y ’, which is interchangeable with ‘ X - yǐ - V - Y ’ forming ‘ X - yǐ - V - Y ’ + kě where ‘ yǐ - V - Y ’ is moved after kě to avoid the top-heavy problem. Moreover, the “verb moving backward” hypothesis provides new insights into the formation process of similar constructions (e.g., nán 难 ‘be difficult to V ,’ yì 易 ‘be easy to V ,’ zú 足 ‘be sufficient to V ’ constructions) in ancient Chinese, as well as the study of tough constructions.']",1,0

"['The Linguistic and Cultural Image of the Urban Space of Moscow in the Late Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Centuries (on the Basis of V. Elistratov’s Dictionary) The aim of this article is to reconstruct the linguistic and cultural image of Moscowat the turn of the twentieth century using the paradigm of cultural linguistics. This paradigm was selected as the theoretical framework of the study considering that it practically has not been applied in Russian linguistics. The article shows that the intricate image of the urban space is created by means of cultural elements (the coat of arms, the flag, the bugle call, architecture) and, most of all, linguistic elements whose major exponent is a given urban dialect. It is a wide-ranging construct whose lexis, apart from native elements, also includes a large number of foreign components and proprial (official and unofficial) vocabulary. The conglomerate of these elements can be regarded as a specific language of the urban space. Językowo-kulturowy obraz przestrzeni miejskiej Moskwy na przełomie XIX i XX wieku (na bazie słownika W. Jelistratowa) Artykuł podejmuje się rekonstrukcji językowo-kulturowych elementów przestrzeni miejskiej Moskwy w aspekcie diachronicznym (przełom XIX i XX wieku) przy użyciu metod lingwistyki kulturowej. Zasadność wyboru tego paradygmatu wynika z faktu, iż na gruncie językoznawstwa rosyjskiego nie jest on uprawiany. Artykuł pokazuje, że na skomplikowany obraz przestrzeni miejskiej składają się aspekty kulturowe (architektura, herb, hejnał, flaga), a przede wszystkim językowe (dialekt miejski, zapożyczenia obce, nieoficjalna urbanonimia).

"['espanolA partir de un corpus compuesto integramente por textos de inmediatez comunicativa, el presente estudio analiza un fenomeno de variacion que enfrento a los adverbios asi y ansi durante los Siglos de Oro. En el marco de la sociolinguistica historica, el analisis de regresion logistica de efectos mixtos efectuado muestra que la forma vernacula ansi gozo de un considerable exito durante buena parte de este periodo, si bien conocio un momento culminante entre 1540 y 1620. Sin embargo, a partir de entonces, los usos del adverbio irian descendiendo bruscamente hasta cerrar la centuria con empleos que hacian presagiar ya la censura a la que el adverbio iba a ser sometido a partir del siglo XVIII. Otro resultado relevante es que, en la difusion de ansi, cobraron especial importancia algunos factores extralinguisticos en mucha mayor medida que los linguisticos, un hecho poco habitual entre las variables gramaticales, aunque explicable en este caso por el componente morfo-lexico que presenta este hecho de variacion. Los factores mas destacados fueron de caracter dialectal –la principal distribucion de la forma vernacula tuvo lugar en las areas centro-meridionales de la Peninsula, asi como en las comunidades americanas– y sociolectal, con una preferencia mayor por ansi entre los estratos bajos, seguidos por los intermedios y a distancia de las elites, las cuales se mostraron siempre mas reacias a su empleo, especialmente a partir del siglo XVII. EnglishBased on a corpus of communicative immediacy texts, the present study analyzes the variation between the adverbs ansi and asi during the Golden Age Spanish period. Within the framework of historical sociolinguistics, the mixed-effects logistic regression analysis carried out shows that the vernacular form ansi enjoyed considerable success during this period, although it reached its peak between 1540 and 1620. However, from the latter date onwards, the uses of the adverb declined sharply until the end of the century, foreshadowing the negative attitudes to which ansi was exposed from the 18th century onwards. Another meaningful result of the study is that, in the diffusion of ansi, some extralinguistic factors took on special relevance to a much greater extent than the linguistic ones, an unusual fact among grammatical variables, perhaps explainable in this case by the important morpho-lexical component that this variation represents. The most relevant factors were of a dialectal –the main distribution of the vernacular form took place in the central-southern areas of Spain, as well as in the American speech communities– and sociolectal nature, with a greater preference for ansi among the lower strata, followed by the intermediate ones, and both of them a long way from the social elites. These elites were always more reluctant to use the vernacular form, especially from the middle of the Seventeenth century onwards.']",1,0

Peak intraoral air pressure ( P 0 ), duration of consonantal closure ( D c ) and peak r.m.s. sound pressure associated with the consonantal release ( P b ) for selected English plosives were obtained from the recordings. Systematic changes in aerodynamic parameters associated with a conversational context vs citation contexts were probed. Intraoral pressures were found to be comparable to published values for plosives in syllable- and sentence-contexts, and voiceless plosives were consistently produced with greater magnitudes of P 0 than were voiced plosives. The data also indicate weak to moderate correspondences among P 0 , D c and P b , show that contextual and idiosyncratic effects significantly modify aerodynamic parameters of stop consonant articulation.']",1,0

"['This paper examines the nature of labels created by External and Internal Merge operations. The standard minimalist assumption is that in External Merge structures, one of the merged elements projects as the label, and in Internal Merge structures, the Probe does. However, these two options do not exhaust all the possibilities. For External Merge of α and β, the options that do not violate Inclusiveness are: ( i ) Project α, ( ii ) Project β, ( iii ) Project Both α and β, and ( iv ) Project Neither α nor β. For Internal Merge , the options are: ( i ) Project Probe , ( ii ) Project Goal , ( iii ) Project Both Probe and Goal , and (iv) Project Neither Probe nor Goal .

"['espanolAl menos desde la primera mitad del siglo XX, una disyuntiva interrogo a distintas figuras de la ciencia espanola e hispanoamericana: si comunicar sus hallazgos en revistas y lenguas extranjeras con el fin de ampliar su difusion, o bien apelar al espanol y, aun con las limitaciones que ello implicaba, apostar a la trascendencia de sus investigaciones en lengua nacional. En el ensayo “La ciencia y el idioma” (1937), el medico Pio del Rio Hortega fundamenta la importancia patriotica de difundir en espanol y discute con aquellos que optan por hacerlo en idiomas extranjeros, por caso, los medicos e investigadores Santiago Ramon y Cajal y Bernardo Houssay (Premio Nobel en 1906 y 1957, respectivamente). El presente articulo aborda las consideraciones de Rio Hortega, analiza sus fundamentaciones y, paralelamente, establece un dialogo con las posturas de Cajal y de Houssay. El trabajo se inscribe en una perspectiva glotopolitica, cuyo proposito es el estudio de las intervenciones en el espacio publico del lenguaje (Arnoux y Del Valle 2010), perspectiva operativa para indagar las distintas representaciones sobre el espanol como lengua de la ciencia. En este enfoque, los textos son analizados como discursos, es decir, en tanto formulados en condiciones historicas de produccion, por lo que su indagacion implica un estudio simultaneo y reciproco de sus dimensiones verbales y sociohistoricas (Maingueneau 2012). Adelantamos que en la palabra de Rio Hortega puede leerse una temprana advertencia sobre el proceso de minorizacion linguistica del espanol en la esfera cientifica, que sus contribuciones terminologicas pueden ser consideradas como una expresion de su posicionamiento, y que las posturas aqui formuladas anticipan interrogantes que actualmente interpelan a aquellos investigadores que producen su labor desde lenguas diferentes o espacios distantes de las grandes potencias cientificas. EnglishAt least since the first half of the 20th century a quandary confronted different figures of Spanish and Hispano-American science: whether to communicate their findings in foreign journals and languages in order to widen their diffusion, or to resort to Spanish and, even with the limitations that that implied, to take a chance on the transcendence of their investigations in the national tongue. In his essay “La ciencia y el idioma” (1937), the physician Pio del Rio Hortega substantiates the patriotic importance of disseminating in Spanish and debates with those that decide to do it in foreign languages, such as the physicians and researchers Santiago Ramon y Cajal and Bernardo Houssay (Nobel Prize in 1906 and 1957 respectively). The present article addresses the considerations of Rio Hortega, analyses their foundations and, simultaneously, engages in dialogue with the positions of Cajal and Houssay. This work is grounded in a glotopolitical perspective whose purpose is the study of interventions in the public space of language (Arnoux and Del Valle 2010), an operative perspective to inquire into the different representations of Spanish as the language of science. From this perspective, texts are analysed as discourse, that is to say, as formulated in historical conditions of production, which means that their inquiry implies a simultaneous and reciprocal study of their verbal and sociohistorical dimensions (Mangueneau 2012). We anticipate that in the words of Rio Hortega there can be read an early warning on the process of linguistic minorization of Spanish in the scientific sphere, that his terminological contributions can be considered an expression of his positioning, and that the positions here formulated anticipate interrogations that currently question those researchers that carry out their work in different languages or places distant from great scientific powers.']",1,0
"[""It is the purpose of this paper to explain one syntactic construction, that in Portuguese corresponds to one French type of construction which can be illustrated by the following sentences: Max donne un coup d'accélérateur à sa voiture.

These examples intend to show that the sentences used above are in relation with the next two as para-phrases: O Pedro acelera o carro (Peter accelerates his car) O Pedro amolga o carro (Peter smashes his car) We listed the Portuguese verbs that can be associated with the following forms N 0 dar Det V-n (Prep N 1 +E), N 0 fazer Det V-n (Prep N 1 + E).

The attrition patterns of *t and *k in Nauruan resemble similar 8 developments in Eastern Chuukic. An unusual developments are shifts of 9 major place of articulation, from coronal to velar, and from velar to labial. 10 This paper contains a discussion of the reflexes of Proto-Oceanic palatals 11 in Micronesian. A list of Kiribati loans in Nauruan is supplied. 12 Keywords: Nauruan; Kiribati; Micronesian; Sound Change; Lenition 13 1. INTRODUCTION.1 14 1.1. OVERVIEW. This paper investigates the internal phonological develop15 ments in Nauruan (NAU), a Micronesian spoken by just under 10,000 people in 16 the Republic of Nauru and diaspora (Eberhard, Simons, and Fennig 2021). The 17 status of NAU as a Micronesian language was established by Hughes (2020a,b). 18 Building on that work, this paper investigates the reflexes of Proto-Micronesian 19 (PMC) phonemes in NAU. 20 The phonemic inventory of NAU is given in table 1, following the proposals 21 in the synchronic description in Blumenfeld (2022). Closely related proposals 22 are found in Hughes (2020b); see discussion in Blumenfeld (2022) on the dif23 ferences between the two proposals. The rhotic ř is distinguished from r by a 24 higher degree of constriction and frication (Hughes 2020b:92ff.). Distinct from 25 the glides /j,w/ are semivowels /i̯,u ̯ /, which in turn are in complementary dis26 tribution with corresponding vowels /i,u/; see Blumenfeld (2022) for details. 27 The vowel inventory is shown in table 2. In addition, the symbol [a] is used 28 as a disjunction of [ʌ] and [ɑ] where the identity of the vowel is uncertain (see 29 details in Blumenfeld 2022). 30 This paper sets up the correspondences for consonants in table 3 (vowels are 31 discussed separately in section 2.9). The symbol *z in this table refers to the 1.

An analysis based on the discrete classification of / s / variants shows that a combination of linguistic factors (following consonant and stress) influences / s / realization. An analysis based on the phonetic coding of / s / variants (using measures of fricative duration, relative voicing, and center of gravity) reveals the extent to which velar fricatives display an intermediate status along the phonetic continuum of / s / lenition variations. Taken together, these analyses shed light on the nature of coda / s / in Spanish and on the extent to which the attested allophony constitutes a lenition process.']",1,0

"['When Turkic-speaking Tabghatch conquered China in 386 ce and ruled her for nearly 200 years, they, being minority rulers, elected to take up Chinese writing system and language as the official means of communication with its subject population.

This work describes 7 cases of Turkic-rooted Sinitic functional expressions, all featuring the word 的 [d-], supported with historical citations in Chinese documents, believed to be cultural continua of the xnl : 1) The constative preterite -dI, -dXŋ → the constative 的 [də], 底 [di], 端 [duan] 2) The nominalizer -dOk+ in free relative clause → Sinitc 的 [də], 底 [di], 得 [də] in free relative clause 3) The nominalizer -dOk+ in bound relative clause → Sinitic 底 [di], 的 [də] in bound relative clause 4) The adverb of manner suffix +tI/+dI → the adverb of manner suffixes 地 [di], 底 [di], 的 [də] 5) The locative-ablative case suffixes +dA/+tA → the locative suffixes 底 [di], 頭 [tou], 的 [də] 6) The perfect participle -dOk → the perfect participles 得 [də], 的 [di] 7) The completive perfect formative ïd- → the completive perfect formatives 得 [də], 的 [di]']",1,0

"[""In Aucassin et Nicolette, VIII, 7, occurs this passage: Et li cris lieve et la noise, et li cevalier et li serjant s'arment et qeurent as portes et as murs por le castel desfendre, et li borgois montent as aleoirs des murs, si jetent quariax et peus aguisids. Roques simply defines 'chemin de ronde'I; Suchier, too, has it as 'Gang auf der Festungsmauer' implying, however, that a technical connotation might be involved2. It is the purpose of this note to explain what the last named editor fails to explain, namely just what this connotation is. In our citation, it is evident that there is a contrast offered as to the method of protection adopted by the soldiers and the bourgeoisie. The former put on armor. This is the force we may rightly attach to s'armer, knowing that in OF armes could refer as well to defensive as to offensive equipment. The civilian population is not thus protected. These men are surely not to fight exposed to the arrows or crossbolts of the enemy without other protection than the crenelated breastwork. They take refuge, says the text, in the aleoirs, which cannot, then, refer to the almost open road on top of the walls. This is the situation as explained by a noted French archaeologist:3 'Le chemin de ronde qui surmonte les remparts 4tait quelquefois 6largi au moyen d'encorbeillements, A l'extdrieur par des hourds ou des machicoulis, 1'int6rieur par un encorbeillement de pierre, une galerie ou coursiere de bois, couverte d'un toit qui protege les d6fenseurs contre les projectiles lanc6s audessus du parapet.' Coursiere is in all likelihood equivalent to the aleoir, for it would seem to be derived from course, substantive of courir; see, for instance, Du Cange, s.v. Corsseria: 'Via lustrandis vigiliis aliisque usibus accomoda, per quam de loco ad locum curritur', also Mistral coursiero, Raynouard corsieyra, George Sand coursiere4. Now""]",1,0

"['espanolEn esta investigacion se analiza la gestion tematica en una muestra de 50 entrevistas cli- nicas realizadas a personas con diagnostico de esquizofrenia cronica y de primer episodio, desde la perspectiva de la linguistica clinica aplicada a la psiquiatria. Especificamente se propone determinar si existen diferencias en la gestion tematica entre ambos grupos de pacientes. Asimismo, a fin de probar si constituye un marcador de deficit primario, se pretende verificar la relacion entre la gestion tematica, el estadio de la enfermedad y el sexo. El analisis de los datos, en primer lugar demuestra que es posible observar la perdida de la unidad tematica, la presentacion frecuente de topicos sin desarrollo referencial y saltos topicales en personas con esquizofrenia de primer episodio. En segunda instancia, las variables estadio de la enfermedad y sexo presentan significacion estadistica, por lo cual, es posible considerar la gestion tematica como un marcador primario de deficit pragmalinguistico para esquizofrenia.

Specifically it proposes to determine if differences exist in the thematic management between both groups of patients. Likewise, in order to try if it constitutes a scoreboard of primary deficit one tries to check the relation between the thematic management, the stadium of the disease and the sex. Also, in order to test whether it is a marker of primary deficit is to verify the relationship between the subject management, disease stage and sex. The analysis of the information, first it demonstrates that it is possible to observe the loss of the thematic unit, the frequent presentation of topics without referential development and of leaps of discursive topics in persons with schizophrenia of the first episode. Secondly, the variables disease stage and sex have statistical significance, therefore, it is possible to consider the issue management as a primary marker of pragmalinguistic deficit schizophrenia.']",1,0

Solche Analysen kommen jedoch nicht mit dem Auftreten von Anreden in der Satzmitte zurecht. In diesem Aufsatz wird vorgeschlagen, dass Vokative (insbesondere Anreden) mit dem Specifier einer funktionalen Projektion verbunden werden (Merge), und zwar in AddrP im Topik-Feld der CP-Domane (zwischen der hochsten TopP und FocP). Diese Position erfasst zutreffend, dass Vokative in der Mitte des Satzes eine informationsstrukturelle Grenze zwischen alter Information (Topik) und neuer Information (Fokus) darstellen.

EnglishBeginning with MORO (2003), generative analyses of vocatives have proposed that they are associated with functional projections at the left edge of or above CP. Such analyses, however, are unable to account for the existence of mid-sentential addresses. This article proposes that vocatives (specifically addresses) are merged into the specifier of a functional projection, AddrP, which is located in the topic field of the CP domain (specifically between the highest TopP and FocP). This position correctly reflects that mid-sentential vocatives delineate an information structure boundary between old information (topics) and new information (focus). I show that the derivation of mid-sentential vocatives is sensitive to syntactic islands, supporting their treatment in the narrow syntax.']",1,0

This article investigates the patterns underlying such items. It appears that in both languages the presence of a /ə/ in V 2 is fundamentally determined by the pattern (some patterns implying /ə/ and others ∅), although the presence of a sonorant as the third root consonant conditions the presence of a /ə/ in actual lexemes whatever the pattern. This together with other phonological processes creates, especially in Mehri, complicated cross-matches between the underlying patterns and the attested realisations. Their identification sheds light on the morphological correspondences between Mehri and Jibbali. It is finally argued that patterns of the C 1 V́C 2 C 3 type go back to Proto-Semitic patterns in *C 1 VC 2 C 3 , whereas most patterns of the C 1 V́C 2 əC 3 type go back to *C 1 ā̆C 2 ī̆C 3 .']",1,0

"[""ONE OF THE CONTROVERSIAL ISSUES in study of black English has been verb morphology, particularly synchronic status and diachronic provenance of paradigmatically related present tense verb endings -s and zero. The observation that third person singular -s is frequently deleted by lower class black speakers has lead to assumption that the third singular present tense marker is not required in black dialect (Lanier 1976, p. 51; cf. Funkhouser 1973, pp. 809-10, 819; Fickett 1972, p. 17; Loflin, Sobin, and Dillard 1973, p. 24; Smitherman 1977, p. 26). This view was originally offered by creolists in connection with creole substratum hypothesis, which suggests a creole origin of dialects spoken by blacks in United States (cf. e.g., Dillard 1972, pp. 40-42; Traugott 1976, p. 88); for use of uninflected verb forms is typical of pidgin and creole languages, e.g., Gullah (Turner 1949, p. 224; Van Sertima 1976, p. 141), Haitian Creole (Hall 1966, p. 109) and West African Pidgin English (Grade 1892, p. 383), which reveals influence of African languages (Turner 1948, p. 78; cf. Hall 1966, p. 109; Van Sertima 1976, p. 141). By virtue of results of recent sociolinguistic research, which has shown uninflected verb to be predominant third person singular form in black English, this hypothesis has obtained considerable support among sociolinguists as well (e.g., Fasold and Wolfram 1970, pp. 63-64; Fasold 1971; Fasold 1981, pp. 170-71; Labov 1970b, p. 230).' William Labov infers from relatively high proportion of zero forms, lack of stylistic variation, and inefficacy of phonological constraints, that there is no underlying third singular -s in NNE [Nonstandard Negro English] (Labov, Cohen, Robins, and Lewis 1968, 1: 164). Within this theoretical framework, existing -s suffixes in black English have been interpreted, if in third person singular, as post-creole interference from standard English, or, if in any other grammatical person, as hypercorrect usage,2 as is explained by Burling (1973, p. 49):""]",1,0

"['The lateral approximant in General British English (GB) is realised as light when occurring in the onset ( l eaf ), and as dark in the rhyme ( he l p , fee l , goog l e ). Non-prevocalic positions are typical contexts for lenition, analysed in Element Theory as decomposition in weak positions. However, it is unclear how velarisation can be characterised as element loss if light [l] is represented as | A I |, while dark [ɫ] is represented as | A U |. Therefore, I propose that laterals in GB contain both the coronal | I | and the velar | U | element underlyingly (in addition to | A |), but because these cannot combine in a compound segment in English, they are both floating. Their association at the phrase level is determined by the apophonic chain (Guerssel &amp; Lowenstamm 1996), mapped onto the structure of the syllable: | I | is attracted to the prevocalic position, | A | to the vocalic position and | U | to the postvocalic position. Darkening thus does not involve lenition of /l/, but partial interpretation in all positions. In contrast, I analyse vocalisation of dark [ɫ] as lenition, involving loss of | A | in weak positions. I integrate the lateral into the system of glides in English, and establish a typology of its behaviour across different accents.']",1,0

"[""Abstract In this article, we will argue that Dutch inalienable possession constructions such as (1a) and (1b) have the same underlying structure in (2a): (1a) is derived by means of an obligatory movement of the predicate of the BIJ -phrase into the specifier of the locational PP, as in (2b); (1b), in its turn, is derived from the structure in (2b) by incorporation of the functor BIJ into the verb, as a result of which the NP is assigned dative Case. This analysis is consistent with Hoekstra's (1994) hypothesis, according to which inalienable possession is syntactically encoded by means of a functor P ( BIJ ) that takes the possessor as its internal and the possessum as its external argument: [ SC [ NP Possessum][P [ NP Possessor]]. 1.

"['EnglishIn a wordnet, concepts are typically represented as groups of words, commonly known as synsets, and each membership of a word to a synset denotes a different sense of that word. However, since word senses are complex entities, without well-defined boundaries, we suggest to handle them less artificially, by representing them as fuzzy objects, where each word has its membership degree, which can be related to the confidence on using the word to denote the concept conveyed by the synset. We thus propose an approach to discover synsets from a synonymy network, ideally redundant and extracted from several broad-coverage sources. The more synonymy relations there are between two words, the higher the confidence on the semantic equivalence of at least one of their senses. The proposed approach was applied to a network extracted from three Portuguese dictionaries and resulted in a large set of fuzzy synsets. Besides describing this approach and illustrating its results, we rely on three evaluations — comparison against a handcrafted Portuguese thesaurus; comparison against the results of a previous approach with a similar goal; and manual evaluation — to believe that our outcomes are positive and that, in the future, they might my expanded by exploring additional synonymy sources portuguesNuma wordnet, conceitos sao representados atraves de grupos de palavras, vulgarmente chamados de synsets, e cada pertenca de uma palavra a um synset representa um diferente sentido dessa mesma palavra. Mas como os sentidos sao entidades complexas, sem fronteiras bem definidas, para lidar com eles de forma menos artificial, sugerimos que synsets sejam tratados como conjuntos difusos, em que cada palavra tem um grau de pertenca, associado a confianca que existe na utilizacao de cada palavra para transmitir o conceito que emerge do synset. Propomos entao uma abordagem automatica para descobrir um conjunto de synsets difusos a partir de uma rede de sinonimos, idealmente redundante, por ser extraida a partir de varias fontes, e o mais abrangentes possivel. Um dos principios e que, em quantos mais recursos duas palavras forem consideradas sinonimos, maior confianca havera na equivalencia de pelo menos um dos seus sentidos. A abordagem proposta foi aplicada a uma rede extraida a partir de tres dicionarios do portugues e resultou num novo conjunto de synsets para esta lingua, em que as palavras tem pertencas difusas, ou seja, fuzzy synsets. Para alem de apresentar a abordagem e a ilustrar com alguns resultados obtidos, baseamo-nos em tres avaliacoes — comparacao com um tesauro criado manualmente para o portugues; comparacao com uma abordagem anterior com o mesmo objetivo; e avaliacao manual — para confirmar que os resultados sao positivos, e poderao no futuro ser expandidos atraves da exploracao de outras fontes de sinonimos.']",1,0

We describe his role as that of a glottopolitical vector, i.e. a key figure in the circulation and transformation of knowledge and ideological representations of the languages of Chile and their speakers. We highlight that his arrival to Chile caused a languageideological fracture, as he confronted the hegemony of linguistic normativism and hispanism, established on the basis of the influential works by Andres Bello. His polemical stance towards the dominant ideology explains that the recovering and revaluation of his work is a relatively recent phenomenon, as some of the articles of this special issue show.

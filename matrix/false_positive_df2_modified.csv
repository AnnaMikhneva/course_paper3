"['Hittite grammar has been of great interest to comparative linguistics ever since it was deciphered by Bedřich Hrozný in 1915 and published in 1917 as Die Sprache der Hethiter (SH). Here we find the first description of the Hittite nominal system. In this article, I focus on the spatial cases as described by Hrozný and as they are understood today. In Part 1, I present the background of Hrozný’s research. In part 2, spatial cases and their internal structure are outlined. In Part 3, I discuss the Hittite spatial cases as described in SH and as understood by contemporary researchers, with a focus on the basis for possible misunderstandings. Part 4 provides an overview of later research regarding the nominal system, and especially the spatial cases. The conclusion summarizes the comparison of Die Sprache der Hethiter and contemporary research.']",1,0

"[""This study examines the syntactical differences between grammaticalized complements and general complements in Mandarin Chinese. Focusing on four directional complements-shang 上 (up), xia 下 (down), qi 起 (rise), and chu 出 (out)-we investigate the grammaticalization of these directional complements in light of image schemata (Talmy 1988, 2000) and aims to review Heine, Claudi & Hunnemeyer's (1991) proposal of grammatical structure. The result shows that the grammaticalization of directional complements can be written as space movement ⇒ space → non-specific space → time → status, which is generally in accordance with the grammatical structure proposed by Heine, Claudi & Hunnemeyer (1991). However, the additional step of space → non-specific space can be observed in the directional complements of modern Chinese.""]",1,0

"['This article describes the emergence of the dialectal differences in phonology that eventually led to the division of Western Karaim into two dialects. The study is based on manuscripts and manuscript editions covering the period between the 17th and 20th centuries. Special attention is paid to the relative chronology of the phonological changes. A periodization of Western Karaim is also proposed. 1. Preliminary remarks In an article published in 2010 I contended that, based on the materials that were at our disposal at the time, it was not possible to say with any certainty whether the Karaims ever had a common literary language (Nemeth 2010: 199, fn. 1). Meanwhile, Radloff (1888: 179), Kowalski (1929: xlviii–xlix), and Dubinski (1968: 215) claimed quite categorically that the dialectal differences between Northand South-Western Karaim must have already existed prior to the first wave of migrations to the territories of Poland and Lithuania.1 Now, however, this view must be revised in light 1 Given the importance of these opinions and since it is difficult to gain access to some of these works I will quote the crux of the respective fragments: (1) Radloff (1888: 179): “[...] Beide Sprachen beweisen unumstosslich, dass die Karaimen, die vor Jahrhunderten in Luzk angesiedelt wurden, schon bei ihrer Einwanderung nach Volhynien eine andere Mundart des Krym-Dialectes sprachen, als die Karaimen von Troki.” (2) Kowalski (1929: xlviii–xlix): “Fassen wir nun das bisher Gesagte zusammen, so konnen wir die oben gestellte Frage nach der beiden']",1,0

"['Liangdao Man and Austronesian origins Laurent Sagart (bio) The discovery of Liangdao Man, a skeleton C-14 dated to c. 6000 BCE, under a shell mound in Liang Island north of the Taiwan strait, and the sequencing by Ko et al. (2014) of its mitochondrial DNA, have brought new light on Austronesian origins. Liangdao man’s mtDNA belongs to a very early form of haplogroup E, which is exclusively Austronesian and well represented in Taiwan in two forms: E1 and E2. In JCL 43.1A (2015), Paul Li discusses the “implications for the pre-Austronesian homeland” of the discovery of Liangdao man. Li’s assumptions are these: on the ground of morphological arguments in Reid (1994), he accepts the view that Austronesian and Austroasiatic are sister branches of ‘Austric’. A critique of these morphological arguments can be found in Kaufman (2013). Li also accepts the arguments of Norman and Mei (1976) for an Austroasiatic presence on the southeast China coast. See however Sagart (2008) for a critique of their lexical arguments. Based on these assumptions Li supposes that unitary Austric was spoken on the southeast China coast and that Liangdao man spoke Austric (‘an Austric’, p. 228). Li correctly reports the finding by Ko et al. that Liangdao Man’s mtDNA is the ancestral form of all Formosan E1 haplotypes. He is silent, however, on the origin of Haplogroup E: according to Ko et al., haplogroup E developed out of haplogroup M9 on the southeast China coast near Fuzhou c. 8,136–10,933 years ago. As to haplogroup M9 itself, it gave rise to another daughter on the mainland: M9a, which is found among Chinese, Tibetan and other Sino-Tibetan-speaking groups. This directly support of the Sino-Tibetan-Austronesian theory (Sagart 2005), as Ko et al. note: [End Page 239] At around the time when haplogroup E developed from M9 in the population that later carried it into Taiwan, the surrounding regions gave rise to M9a* lineages that are now carried by Sinitic speakers. Thus, the Han, Liangdao Man, and Formosan haplogroup M9a/E lineages can be traced to an ancestral M9 mtDNA lineage (Figure 3). Additionally, the Tibetans have a high frequency of M9a lineages that is shown to have coalesced during the Neolithic and there is a hypothesized linguistic link between Sino-Tibetan and Austronesian languages. Human genetics, then, do not confirm the Austric claim: rather, Austronesian E Haplogroup’s most direct sister is the Sino-Tibetan M9a haplogroup, which points to Sino-Tibetan as Austronesian’s next of kin. A pre-Austronesian homeland located in north China will also explain the northern Chinese look of early Austronesian agriculture: two of the main Austronesian cereals—foxtail millet, broomcorn millet—originate in northern China, and are unknown archaeologically in the Yangtze Valley and south of it. A third cereal: rice, was under monoculture in the Yangtze Valley, but was also exploited in the north together with foxtail and broomcorn at very early dates, for instance at Yuezhuang in northwestern Shandong c. 6000 BCE or Tanghu in Henan c. 5700 BCE.

The present study concentrates on the behavior of complex clauses, following a major distinction between paratactic and hypotactic constructions. Paratactic constructions are divided into asyndetic and syndetic constructions. The latter are quite frequent and it is common to find the syndetons: mang , ni , ihchi and ine in the combination of sentences in regular speech. Hypotactic constructions also have asyndetic and syndetic constructions usually functioning as object complements. There is also evidence for reported speech, indirect questions and adverbial clauses (classified at least into seven different types).

In a recent paper, Kayne (1999) argues that they have both these properties.

The prepositional complementizer then moves to a higher functional head, and VP moves to the specifier position of this head.

"[""L'objectif de cette etude est d'examiner le role de l'aspect lexical et de la frequence des formes dans l'input dans la production orale des formes du passe par des enfants suedois (âges de 4 a 9 ans) apprenants du francais langue seconde (L2) en immersion. Le role de la frequence dans l'input est souvent neglige dans les etudes sur l'influence de l'aspect lexical tout comme les caracteristiques specifiques des verbes le sont dans les etudes consacrees a l'influence de la frequence des formes. L'analyse de 21 verbes dans l'input puis dans la production des cinq enfants durant les deux premieres annees d'exposition au francais montre un recoupement entre les deux facteurs. Bien que les enfants produisent la plupart des verbes selon leur aspect lexical, les frequences type et d'occurrence dans l'input permettent d'expliquer a la fois le marquage correct du passe ainsi que la variation que l'on trouve dans les groupes de verbes etudies. Les resultats confirment ainsi les predictions d'une approche basee sur l'usage selon laquelle les apprenants construisent leur grammaire a partir de leur experience de l'input. Abstract: The aim of this study is to investigate the role of lexical aspect and input frequency in Swedish children's production of past tense form in spoken L2 French. The children are between 4 and 9 years old and learners of French by immersion in a French school in Sweden. The role of input frequency has often been overlooked in studies on the influence of lexical aspect as well as specific verb characteristics in studies on input frequency. The analysis of 21 verbs in the input and in the production of the five children during the two first years of exposure to French shows that the two factors overlap. Although the children produce most of the verbs as expected from the lexical aspect, type and token frequency in the input explain both the correct past tense marking and the variation found in the group of verbs under investigation. The results confirm the predictions from a usage-based approach, that learners develop their grammar from their experience of input.""]",1,0

"[""In his edition of some of the historical prism inscriptions of Assurbanipal, A. C. Piepkorn classified A 8008, a fragment of a clay prism measuring 6.8 x 6.7 x 1.6 cm, as a sub-edition of Prism B (B4) since it conformed in general to the texttype of B7' but departed from it in one passage.2 He noted only that its contents corresponded to B ii 55-70, but that after B ii 65 the inscription added [pa-an (isu)ni]ri-ia 6-tir-ram-[ma], turned my [cha]riot around [and].'3 R. D. Freedman suggested tentatively that the piece was a fragment of Prism C, but was unable to confirm this since the fragment's contents were not available in any form; the identification was probably made on pa-an cISSUDUN-i[a...] in BM 127941 ii' 10' (his ex. W, Borger's C7), an exemplar of Prism C that preserve part of this same variant.4 R. Borger was unable to examine and properly ide tify A 8003 for his editions of Assurbanipal's prism inscriptions since the fragment was missing (verschollen, nicht auffindbar);5 he accepts with cau ion Freedman's identification of B4 as an exemplar of C.6 During a recent trip I made to the Oriental Institute f the University of Chicago (December, 2003), the inscription was once again available for study. A cursory examination supported Freedman's suggestion that Piepkorn's B4 was an exemplar of Prism C, not only because it contained the noted deviation after B ii 65 (col. i' 18'), but also since A 8008 is clearly from a decagonal, not an octagonal, clay prism. A closer study of the fragment revealed that col. i' 14' also deviates from Prisms B and D (ii 66), as well as from Prism C (iii 97), and that col. ii', which was not referred to by Piepkorn, corresponds to Prisms B/D iii 74-78 and Prism C iv 84-87.7 With regard to the textual alteration, gal-meg a-tu-ra a-na NINAKI URU ENu-ti-ia (I safely returned to Nineveh, the city of my lordship) was changed to [sal-mel a]-tu-ra ana KURagUr[I] ([I] returned [safely] to Assyria).8 Since Borger's Prism G contains a number of textual changes, I tentatively identified A 8003 as belonging to that edition of Assurbanipal's res 1.

"['Penelitian ini dilatarbelakangi oleh pentingnya kedudukan dialog karena dialog merupakan bagian utama dalam drama. Oleh sebab itu, unsur-unsur yang membentuk sebuah dialog tersebut perlu diperhatikan karena baik atau tidaknya kualitas sebuah drama ditentukan oleh dialog. Sebagai bentuk kesusasteraan, tidak ada alasan bagi kita, baik praktisi, peneliti, ataupun penikmat drama untuk tidak mempelajari dan menganalisis teks drama sepanjang kita tidak melupakan bahwa tulisan tersebut untuk dipentaskan. Berdasarkan temuan penelitian didapatkan empat simpulan. Pertama, pola tuturan yang terdapat pada teks drama ANT karya Wisran Hadi, selain adanya pola pematuhan prinsip kerja sama partisipan juga adanya pelanggaran prinsip kerja sama partisipan. Kedua, dalam penggalan pasangan percakapan, penggalan meminta penjelasan paling banyak digunakan karena antartokoh selalu menuntut adanya suatu aksi yang dibalas dengan reaksi. Ketiga, dari sifat rangkaian tuturan, selain ketiga jenis sifat rangkaian tuturan yang ada, ditemukan pola rangkaian percakapan berkelanjutan. Keempat, dari segi pola kesempatan berbicara, selain pola gilir diatur, ditemukan pola giliran otomatis, dan giliran direbut. Hal tersebut memperlihatkan bahwa teks ANT ini memiliki kekuatan sebagai sebuah teks. The research was motivated by the importance of the position of dialogue because dialogue is a principal part in the drama. Therefore, the elements that make a dialogue needs to be considered as good or bad qualities of a play is determined by the dialogue. As a form of literature, there is no reason for us, both practitioners, researchers, or connoisseurs of drama not to study and analyze the text of the drama as long as we do not forget that writing is to be staged. Based on the findings of the study found four conclusions. First, the speech contained on the text of ANT play by Wisran Hadi, besides the observance of the principles of cooperation of participants is also a violation of the principles of cooperation participants. Second, in a couple snippets of conversations, snippets of the most widely used demand an explanation because between figures always requires an action that met with the reaction. Third, the nature of the speech series, in addition to the three types of speech that is the nature of the series, the series pattern found continue conversation. Fourth, in terms of turn taking, in addition to the pattern of cultivation is set, turn patterns are found automatically, and turn seized. It shows that the text of ANT has its own strengths as a text.']",1,0

"['The Linguistic and Cultural Image of the Urban Space of Moscow in the Late Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Centuries (on the Basis of V. Elistratov’s Dictionary) The aim of this article is to reconstruct the linguistic and cultural image of Moscowat the turn of the twentieth century using the paradigm of cultural linguistics. This paradigm was selected as the theoretical framework of the study considering that it practically has not been applied in Russian linguistics. The article shows that the intricate image of the urban space is created by means of cultural elements (the coat of arms, the flag, the bugle call, architecture) and, most of all, linguistic elements whose major exponent is a given urban dialect. It is a wide-ranging construct whose lexis, apart from native elements, also includes a large number of foreign components and proprial (official and unofficial) vocabulary. The conglomerate of these elements can be regarded as a specific language of the urban space. Językowo-kulturowy obraz przestrzeni miejskiej Moskwy na przełomie XIX i XX wieku (na bazie słownika W.

Zasadność wyboru tego paradygmatu wynika z faktu, iż na gruncie językoznawstwa rosyjskiego nie jest on uprawiany. Artykuł pokazuje, że na skomplikowany obraz przestrzeni miejskiej składają się aspekty kulturowe (architektura, herb, hejnał, flaga), a przede wszystkim językowe (dialekt miejski, zapożyczenia obce, nieoficjalna urbanonimia).

"[""Author's Introduction\r\n\r\nThe field of language dynamics encompasses the study and modeling of how languages develop (language evolution), change, and interact (language competition). It contrasts with traditional historical linguistics in several ways: the focus is on the world's linguistic diversity rather than just on specific languages or language families; methods are quantitative rather than qualitative; computer simulations are employed for elucidating situations that are not immediately observable, being too complex or pertaining to prehistory; the data used are systematic ones gathered in large databases rather than data that happen to be available for select languages. A crucial feature of the methodology is the fine-tuning of simulation models through empirical observations of quantitative distributions such as those of speaker populations or of grammatical features shared among languages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAuthor Recommends\r\n\r\nAmong the following papers the two first are recommended because of the great impact on the field of language dynamics that they have had, and the following three are recommended because they provide useful and up-to-date overviews.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.\u2002Abrams, Daniel, and Steven H.

"['espanolA partir de un corpus compuesto integramente por textos de inmediatez comunicativa, el presente estudio analiza un fenomeno de variacion que enfrento a los adverbios asi y ansi durante los Siglos de Oro. En el marco de la sociolinguistica historica, el analisis de regresion logistica de efectos mixtos efectuado muestra que la forma vernacula ansi gozo de un considerable exito durante buena parte de este periodo, si bien conocio un momento culminante entre 1540 y 1620. Sin embargo, a partir de entonces, los usos del adverbio irian descendiendo bruscamente hasta cerrar la centuria con empleos que hacian presagiar ya la censura a la que el adverbio iba a ser sometido a partir del siglo XVIII. Otro resultado relevante es que, en la difusion de ansi, cobraron especial importancia algunos factores extralinguisticos en mucha mayor medida que los linguisticos, un hecho poco habitual entre las variables gramaticales, aunque explicable en este caso por el componente morfo-lexico que presenta este hecho de variacion. Los factores mas destacados fueron de caracter dialectal –la principal distribucion de la forma vernacula tuvo lugar en las areas centro-meridionales de la Peninsula, asi como en las comunidades americanas– y sociolectal, con una preferencia mayor por ansi entre los estratos bajos, seguidos por los intermedios y a distancia de las elites, las cuales se mostraron siempre mas reacias a su empleo, especialmente a partir del siglo XVII. EnglishBased on a corpus of communicative immediacy texts, the present study analyzes the variation between the adverbs ansi and asi during the Golden Age Spanish period. Within the framework of historical sociolinguistics, the mixed-effects logistic regression analysis carried out shows that the vernacular form ansi enjoyed considerable success during this period, although it reached its peak between 1540 and 1620. However, from the latter date onwards, the uses of the adverb declined sharply until the end of the century, foreshadowing the negative attitudes to which ansi was exposed from the 18th century onwards. Another meaningful result of the study is that, in the diffusion of ansi, some extralinguistic factors took on special relevance to a much greater extent than the linguistic ones, an unusual fact among grammatical variables, perhaps explainable in this case by the important morpho-lexical component that this variation represents. The most relevant factors were of a dialectal –the main distribution of the vernacular form took place in the central-southern areas of Spain, as well as in the American speech communities– and sociolectal nature, with a greater preference for ansi among the lower strata, followed by the intermediate ones, and both of them a long way from the social elites. These elites were always more reluctant to use the vernacular form, especially from the middle of the Seventeenth century onwards.']",1,0

"['Carleton Taylor Hodge Alan S. Kaye How vividly I recall the feeling of eager anticipation looking forward to the well-organized and informative lectures Professor Carleton Hodge presented in his ‘Structure of Ancient Egyptian’ course at the Linguistic Society of America (LSA) Linguistic Institute of the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor during the summer of 1965. I was a graduate student in linguistics at the University of California, Berkeley at the time, taking his and three other courses. Little did I imagine then that he and I would maintain a lively correspondence from that summer on for the next thirty-three years, nor did I expect that we would come to spend so much time together at the joint annual meetings of the American Oriental Society and the North American Conference on Afroasiatic Linguistics, which we would regularly attend for a quarter of a century. We also lectured on each other’s campuses, and I took great delight that many of my fellow Californians personally came to appreciate not only his scholarship (Hodge 1991a and 1991c), but also his charming and celebrated wit and sense of humor. Hodge was born on November 27, 1917 to Clarence Sim and Nina (Eaton) Hodge in Springfield, Illinois, where he was raised. He died on September 8, 1998 at the age of eighty at his home in Bloomington, Indiana, where he was Professor Emeritus of Linguistics and Anthropology at Indiana University (IU).1 He left Illinois in 1935 to attend Depauw University in Greencastle, Indiana, as a Rector Scholar. In those days, he was interested in biblical studies and majored in Greek and Latin, receiving his A.B. Phi Beta Kappa in 1939. During his sophomore year, however, he decided to become a linguist, since he was much influenced (especially at informal Saturday night meetings on anthropological linguistics) by a new member of the Depauw faculty, Charles (Carl) F. Voegelin, Professor of Anthropology. Voegelin was to become Hodge’s lifelong friend, mentor, and colleague at IU. At Voegelin’s urging, Hodge attended the linguistic institutes at the University of Michigan in 1938,2 1939, and 1940, studying with such giants as Edgar Sturtevant, Roland G. Kent, Franklin Edgerton, and Voegelin himself, who taught field methods courses using Delaware and Ojibway. In addition, Hodge was fortunate enough to hear lectures by Leonard Bloomfield. Hodge began his graduate career in linguistics and Oriental studies in fall 1939, at the University of Pennsylvania (where he was a Harrison Scholar and later Fellow) studying with such luminaries as E. A. Speiser (Akkadian, Hebrew, and Urartean), Giorgio Della Vida (Arabic), and W. Norman Brown (Sanskrit). He completed his dissertation under Zellig S. Harris on Hausa (published as Hodge 1947) receiving the Ph.D. in linguistics in 1943. Later that year on June 2, he married Patricia E. Sutcliffe, with whom he had four children.3 They were a devoted couple, and attended many [End Page 156] linguistic conferences together, where they could often be seen walking together in and around the hotel. I fondly recall speaking with her at many of those. Hodge’s first home and position were, strangely enough, in Bloomington, Indiana, where he would later spend most of his career. He was hired by IU for 1943–44 as an instructor of Serbo-Croatian and Bulgarian in the Army Specialized Training Program. The next two years took him to the University of Maryland, College Park, back to the University of Pennsylvania, and to New York City where he worked on the aforementioned Slavic languages and also on Japanese. He was asked to supervise classes in Japanese which used a prepublication version of a manual on the language by Bernard Bloch and Eleanor Harz Jordan. In the fall of 1946 he joined the U.S. State Department, which had a program for foreign service officers, headed by Henry Lee Smith, Jr. Hodge worked for the next sixteen years on pedagogical materials using informants of Bulgarian, Modern Greek, Hausa (Hodge 1963b), Persian (both Iranian and Afghan dialects), Serbo-Croatian, and Turkish, and also served as the editor of FSI language materials (the Foreign Service Institute [FSI] was created by the Foreign Service Act of 1946).

"[""This study takes a force-theoretic approach to Mandarin V 1 -V 2 resultative constructions. Unlike event-based analyses that hold a causing event accountable for a result state, this study attributes a result state to a specific entity involved in the relevant causing event. In this way, V 1 -V 2 resultative construction (RC) sentences have the interpretation that through a causing action, one entity relevant to the action caused a change of state to another entity; this causal influence is reconceptualized as a force from the former entity, characterizing the situation change concerning the latter entity. Following Copley and Harley (2015), this conceptual reanalysis is represented structurally, successfully deriving V 1 -V 2 RC sentences. V 2 and the internal argument DP specify the property of a resultant situation and its holder, defining the force; the external argument DP tells about this force's source; V 1 modifies this force, indicating the causing action through which this force is realized.""]",1,0

"['espanolAl menos desde la primera mitad del siglo XX, una disyuntiva interrogo a distintas figuras de la ciencia espanola e hispanoamericana: si comunicar sus hallazgos en revistas y lenguas extranjeras con el fin de ampliar su difusion, o bien apelar al espanol y, aun con las limitaciones que ello implicaba, apostar a la trascendencia de sus investigaciones en lengua nacional. En el ensayo “La ciencia y el idioma” (1937), el medico Pio del Rio Hortega fundamenta la importancia patriotica de difundir en espanol y discute con aquellos que optan por hacerlo en idiomas extranjeros, por caso, los medicos e investigadores Santiago Ramon y Cajal y Bernardo Houssay (Premio Nobel en 1906 y 1957, respectivamente). El presente articulo aborda las consideraciones de Rio Hortega, analiza sus fundamentaciones y, paralelamente, establece un dialogo con las posturas de Cajal y de Houssay. El trabajo se inscribe en una perspectiva glotopolitica, cuyo proposito es el estudio de las intervenciones en el espacio publico del lenguaje (Arnoux y Del Valle 2010), perspectiva operativa para indagar las distintas representaciones sobre el espanol como lengua de la ciencia. En este enfoque, los textos son analizados como discursos, es decir, en tanto formulados en condiciones historicas de produccion, por lo que su indagacion implica un estudio simultaneo y reciproco de sus dimensiones verbales y sociohistoricas (Maingueneau 2012). Adelantamos que en la palabra de Rio Hortega puede leerse una temprana advertencia sobre el proceso de minorizacion linguistica del espanol en la esfera cientifica, que sus contribuciones terminologicas pueden ser consideradas como una expresion de su posicionamiento, y que las posturas aqui formuladas anticipan interrogantes que actualmente interpelan a aquellos investigadores que producen su labor desde lenguas diferentes o espacios distantes de las grandes potencias cientificas. EnglishAt least since the first half of the 20th century a quandary confronted different figures of Spanish and Hispano-American science: whether to communicate their findings in foreign journals and languages in order to widen their diffusion, or to resort to Spanish and, even with the limitations that that implied, to take a chance on the transcendence of their investigations in the national tongue. In his essay “La ciencia y el idioma” (1937), the physician Pio del Rio Hortega substantiates the patriotic importance of disseminating in Spanish and debates with those that decide to do it in foreign languages, such as the physicians and researchers Santiago Ramon y Cajal and Bernardo Houssay (Nobel Prize in 1906 and 1957 respectively). The present article addresses the considerations of Rio Hortega, analyses their foundations and, simultaneously, engages in dialogue with the positions of Cajal and Houssay. This work is grounded in a glotopolitical perspective whose purpose is the study of interventions in the public space of language (Arnoux and Del Valle 2010), an operative perspective to inquire into the different representations of Spanish as the language of science. From this perspective, texts are analysed as discourse, that is to say, as formulated in historical conditions of production, which means that their inquiry implies a simultaneous and reciprocal study of their verbal and sociohistorical dimensions (Mangueneau 2012). We anticipate that in the words of Rio Hortega there can be read an early warning on the process of linguistic minorization of Spanish in the scientific sphere, that his terminological contributions can be considered an expression of his positioning, and that the positions here formulated anticipate interrogations that currently question those researchers that carry out their work in different languages or places distant from great scientific powers.']",1,0

"[""THAT upstart popular slang word, Scram, has a short but lively history. Its origin is uncertain. Columnists, comic strip artists, and then the less boisterous writers adopted it, interpreted and defined it, and helped to make for it a full set of grammatical forms. The creation of distorted variants, a game with today's generation, has even twisted scram to amskray and scramola. H. L.

A few pages later,2 however, Mencken speaks of scram in the vocabulary of the incarcerated children in orphanages as a borrowing from criminal cant. But L. W.

EnglishThe linguistic impact of the use of literature in an EFL context has been widely studied by different researchers (Quirk and Widdowson 1985; Chapman 1982; Maley 1989). However, a new line of research has emerged recently on the grounds of the theory of reception applied to EFL situations (Carlisle, 2000; Liaw, 2001; Larson, 2009; Khatib, 2011; Shin & Riazantzeva, 2015; Bjelland, 2016). Although this theory was not originally intended for EFL students but for native speakers and competent readers able to take an active role in the reading process, the applications have yielded interesting evidence about the reader who is also a student of English. This paper explores the perceptions of gender roles in three of Virginia Woolf’s stories as well as the students’ expectations in the reading process.

Wang (Wang Shiyuan 王士元）of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) as the honorary chairman of the conference, gave a keynote speech on “Language and cognition across the health-span”. The focus was a consideration of the significant association between the development of the brain and the development of child language, as well as the recession of language and cognition in the sunset of life. He started by reviewing the evolution of the human body: compared to chimpanzees, human infants develop much more complex cognitive processes, such as discriminating phonetic contrasts, likely as a result partly of their significantly larger brain volume. It is noteworthy that language acquisition happens when the infant’s brain weight approaches that of adults. In contrast, there is a decline of brain function in the elderly, associated with structural changes such as the shrinkage of hippocampus. It has been hypothesized that older adults might recruit cognitive resources at lower loads to compensate for cognitive decline. It is important to pay more attention to the neuro-degeneration in the elderly and there is an urgent need for us to come up with better diagnoses and treatments for the senior population with neuropsychiatric disorder. Peng Gang 彭剛 also from PolyU presented the keynote speech “Brain plasticity reflected by using linguistic tones.” He pointed out that the brain has amazing ability to reorganize itself by forming new connections between neurons throughout an individual’s life course. It is necessary to note that different languages shape different brains and different brains produce different perceptions. What is more, different perceptions would produce different behaviors and different behaviors then characterize different languages, which form the triangle model discussed by William S-Y. Wang (2009).3 3. William S-Y.

He was always eager to help and assist and was well respected by all who knew him and through his work those who did not know him. Dick was born in Toledo, Ohio on July 21, 1925. He moved to Washington, D.C in 1936 when his father was appointed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt as advisor to the National Resources Board. Dick earned an A.B. in 1948 and an M.A. in 1949 each from George Washington University. In 1955, Dick received his Ph.D. from Clark University (Worcester, Massachusetts). He also studied in 1953 and 1954 as a Fulbright Scholar at the University of Graz in Austria. Dick served his nation in the 94th Infantry during World War II where he was awarded the Combat Infantryman Badge and received the Bronze Star and four Battle Stars. Dick’s career was always in various aspects of geography and cartography specializing in map editing, quality assurance, and applied toponymy. Although Dick began his career formally with the Central Intelligence Agency, he spent much of 1943 with the Alaska Branch of the U.S. Geological Survey interpreting aerial photographs. He began his formal career at the Central Intelligence Agency where he worked from 1955 to 1961 specializing in editing and later as a specialist in matters of Eastern Europe. In 1961 he became the representative in Washington, D.C. for Rand McNally & Company where he was instrumental in overseeing data collection for Rand McNally’s extensive line of products. His work was highlighted in 1969 when he designed the series of maps showing the world’s oceans and water bodies for inclusion in Rand McNally’s Cosmopolitan Atlas of the World. In 1973, Dick became The Geographer at the Defense Mapping Agency (now National-Geospatial Intelligence Agency) where some of his responsibilities included the foreign geographic names program for the federal government and serving as the Executive Secretary of the U.S. Board on Geographic Names. He retired from his professional career at the Defense Mapping Agency in 1993, but remained active in various professional organizations including the American Congress on Surveying and Mapping where he established its press relations program in 1966 and the Association of American Geographers where he was heavily involved with that organization’s Careers in Geography Program.

Roques simply defines 'chemin de ronde'I; Suchier, too, has it as 'Gang auf der Festungsmauer' implying, however, that a technical connotation might be involved2. It is the purpose of this note to explain what the last named editor fails to explain, namely just what this connotation is. In our citation, it is evident that there is a contrast offered as to the method of protection adopted by the soldiers and the bourgeoisie. The former put on armor. This is the force we may rightly attach to s'armer, knowing that in OF armes could refer as well to defensive as to offensive equipment. The civilian population is not thus protected. These men are surely not to fight exposed to the arrows or crossbolts of the enemy without other protection than the crenelated breastwork. They take refuge, says the text, in the aleoirs, which cannot, then, refer to the almost open road on top of the walls. This is the situation as explained by a noted French archaeologist:3 'Le chemin de ronde qui surmonte les remparts 4tait quelquefois 6largi au moyen d'encorbeillements, A l'extdrieur par des hourds ou des machicoulis, 1'int6rieur par un encorbeillement de pierre, une galerie ou coursiere de bois, couverte d'un toit qui protege les d6fenseurs contre les projectiles lanc6s audessus du parapet.' Coursiere is in all likelihood equivalent to the aleoir, for it would seem to be derived from course, substantive of courir; see, for instance, Du Cange, s.v.

"[""SEVERAL brief glossaries of railroad terms have already appeared in American Speech, namely, 'Railroad Lingo' by Russell V. Batie, Vol. 9 (Feb. 1934), p. 73f., 'Railroad Terms' by J. R. Schultz, Vol: 12 (Apr. 1937), p. 154, and 'The Lingo of Railroad Linemen' by D. V. Snapp, Vol. 13 (Feb. 1938), p. 70f. More comprehensive than the sum of all of these is the glossary in The Railroader by W. F. Cottrell, Stanford University Press (1940), pp. 118-139. The list in The Railroader was compiled from H. L. Mencken's revised edition of The American Language (1936), M. H. Weseen's Dictionary of American Slang (1934), Lucius Beebe's High Iron (1938), from various issues of The Railroad Magazine, and from the author's personal experience. A comprehensive glossary is also given by Freeman H. Hubbard, editor, in the April, 1940, issue of The Railroad Magazine under the title 'Lingo of the Rails.' Batie has a few terms not included in the Railroader glossary. These are G.Y.M., pop car, skunk, train detainer, whiz. Additions by Schultz are hand grenade, hog back, iron man, latch, Little Nemo, sag, target. Snapp's terms belong to a special category and are not found in the other lists, except that corner, meaning a pole to be guyed on account of deviation of line, has a different interpretation in Cottrell's glossary (see below). To a lineman a slug is a block to be buried for anchor with a different meaning to the railroad man (see below), while a crummy is logically a bunk car to a lineman rather than the caboose. Grunt, the lineman's helper, is listed by both Cottrell and Snapp with the additional meaning of locomotive driver given by the former. There are otherwise few differences in meaning recorded. Batie adds an explanation of the origin of brownie, crummy, snake. Cottrell explains shack, brakeman, as probably named after the small huts which in the early days of railroading were frequently mounted on a car near the middle of a train, from which the brakeman sallied to set the hand brakes. Batie suggests that when the train is moving the brakeman stays in the caboose; hence the term shack is applied to him. Some of the railroad""]",1,0

"[""ONE OF THE CONTROVERSIAL ISSUES in study of black English has been verb morphology, particularly synchronic status and diachronic provenance of paradigmatically related present tense verb endings -s and zero. The observation that third person singular -s is frequently deleted by lower class black speakers has lead to assumption that the third singular present tense marker is not required in black dialect (Lanier 1976, p. 51; cf. Funkhouser 1973, pp. 809-10, 819; Fickett 1972, p. 17; Loflin, Sobin, and Dillard 1973, p. 24; Smitherman 1977, p. 26). This view was originally offered by creolists in connection with creole substratum hypothesis, which suggests a creole origin of dialects spoken by blacks in United States (cf. e.g., Dillard 1972, pp. 40-42; Traugott 1976, p. 88); for use of uninflected verb forms is typical of pidgin and creole languages, e.g., Gullah (Turner 1949, p. 224; Van Sertima 1976, p. 141), Haitian Creole (Hall 1966, p. 109) and West African Pidgin English (Grade 1892, p. 383), which reveals influence of African languages (Turner 1948, p. 78; cf. Hall 1966, p. 109; Van Sertima 1976, p. 141). By virtue of results of recent sociolinguistic research, which has shown uninflected verb to be predominant third person singular form in black English, this hypothesis has obtained considerable support among sociolinguists as well (e.g., Fasold and Wolfram 1970, pp. 63-64; Fasold 1971; Fasold 1981, pp. 170-71; Labov 1970b, p. 230).' William Labov infers from relatively high proportion of zero forms, lack of stylistic variation, and inefficacy of phonological constraints, that there is no underlying third singular -s in NNE [Nonstandard Negro English] (Labov, Cohen, Robins, and Lewis 1968, 1: 164). Within this theoretical framework, existing -s suffixes in black English have been interpreted, if in third person singular, as post-creole interference from standard English, or, if in any other grammatical person, as hypercorrect usage,2 as is explained by Burling (1973, p. 49):""]",1,0
"['The Algonquian Linguistic Atlas (URL: www.ling-atlas.ca), a collaborative project started in 2005 (Co-author et al. 2005), is an online multimedia linguistic atlas of Algonquian languages across Canada. It includes data primarily from the Cree-Innu- Naskapi continuum, but also from Mi’kmaw, Ojibwe, Blackfoot, Algonquin, Mitchif, Oji-Cree, and Maliseet, collected from 2002 to the present, including 42 communities from Alberta to Labrador. In this multimedia presentation we show how data previously gathered for the Atlas for pedagogical purposes can be (re-)used to for a bottom-up linguistic study of dialectal boundaries and degree of relatedness of neighbouring languages. The questionnaire includes the elicitation of single words and phrases categorized into 21 themes, such as greetings, kinship terms, days of the week, weather, orders and requests, and hunting. Although the data collected was initially only conversation-based, the questionnaire was later enriched to elicitate and verify patterns of dialectal variation. Using this data and previous smaller-scale dialectal work as a reference, (MacKenzie (1980), Valentine (1995), Beland (1979) and Drapeau (1979)), we identified 114 distinct variable phonological, lexical, grammatical, syntactic and semantic features which were analyzed for each community across the country. The realizations or variants for each feature were coded in each community, creating isogloss maps based on data collected, to be available via the online interface. These individual feature maps are then compared and compiled in R (R Core Team, 2013; Wikham, H. 2009; Wikham, H. et. al, 2016) to reveal the isogloss bundles drawn from the Atlas data. We will demonstrate the usefulness of this bottom-up approach by discussing a few isogloss bundles found. First, an isogloss bundle is confirmed between dialects of Cree-Innu-Naskapi which undergo palatalization, versus those who do not (also attested in MacKenzie 1980). Our findings also show an isogloss bundle at the Manitoba-Ontario border of Canada, where a number of realizations cluster together west of the border versus different realizations to the east. Lastly, while Drapeau (1979) and MacKenzie (1980) noted that the recent sound change of /ʃ/ to /h/ primarily affected n- and l-speakers of Innu, data from the Atlas shows that this change also applies to Oji-Cree speakers, a more Western n-dialect, previously unattested in dialectal work. This research project illustrates how digitized resources designed as pedagogical and lexicological tools can also serve as useful tools for linguistic analysis. Our findings can help deepen the understanding of Algonquian dialectal variation while contributing to the efforts of communities working towards the revitalization and promotion of their languages.

"['The lateral approximant in General British English (GB) is realised as light when occurring in the onset ( l eaf ), and as dark in the rhyme ( he l p , fee l , goog l e ). Non-prevocalic positions are typical contexts for lenition, analysed in Element Theory as decomposition in weak positions. However, it is unclear how velarisation can be characterised as element loss if light [l] is represented as | A I |, while dark [ɫ] is represented as | A U |. Therefore, I propose that laterals in GB contain both the coronal | I | and the velar | U | element underlyingly (in addition to | A |), but because these cannot combine in a compound segment in English, they are both floating. Their association at the phrase level is determined by the apophonic chain (Guerssel &amp; Lowenstamm 1996), mapped onto the structure of the syllable: | I | is attracted to the prevocalic position, | A | to the vocalic position and | U | to the postvocalic position. Darkening thus does not involve lenition of /l/, but partial interpretation in all positions. In contrast, I analyse vocalisation of dark [ɫ] as lenition, involving loss of | A | in weak positions. I integrate the lateral into the system of glides in English, and establish a typology of its behaviour across different accents.']",1,0

This analysis is consistent with Hoekstra's (1994) hypothesis, according to which inalienable possession is syntactically encoded by means of a functor P ( BIJ ) that takes the possessor as its internal and the possessum as its external argument: [ SC [ NP Possessum][P [ NP Possessor]]. 1.

"['EnglishIn a wordnet, concepts are typically represented as groups of words, commonly known as synsets, and each membership of a word to a synset denotes a different sense of that word. However, since word senses are complex entities, without well-defined boundaries, we suggest to handle them less artificially, by representing them as fuzzy objects, where each word has its membership degree, which can be related to the confidence on using the word to denote the concept conveyed by the synset. We thus propose an approach to discover synsets from a synonymy network, ideally redundant and extracted from several broad-coverage sources. The more synonymy relations there are between two words, the higher the confidence on the semantic equivalence of at least one of their senses. The proposed approach was applied to a network extracted from three Portuguese dictionaries and resulted in a large set of fuzzy synsets. Besides describing this approach and illustrating its results, we rely on three evaluations — comparison against a handcrafted Portuguese thesaurus; comparison against the results of a previous approach with a similar goal; and manual evaluation — to believe that our outcomes are positive and that, in the future, they might my expanded by exploring additional synonymy sources portuguesNuma wordnet, conceitos sao representados atraves de grupos de palavras, vulgarmente chamados de synsets, e cada pertenca de uma palavra a um synset representa um diferente sentido dessa mesma palavra. Mas como os sentidos sao entidades complexas, sem fronteiras bem definidas, para lidar com eles de forma menos artificial, sugerimos que synsets sejam tratados como conjuntos difusos, em que cada palavra tem um grau de pertenca, associado a confianca que existe na utilizacao de cada palavra para transmitir o conceito que emerge do synset. Propomos entao uma abordagem automatica para descobrir um conjunto de synsets difusos a partir de uma rede de sinonimos, idealmente redundante, por ser extraida a partir de varias fontes, e o mais abrangentes possivel. Um dos principios e que, em quantos mais recursos duas palavras forem consideradas sinonimos, maior confianca havera na equivalencia de pelo menos um dos seus sentidos. A abordagem proposta foi aplicada a uma rede extraida a partir de tres dicionarios do portugues e resultou num novo conjunto de synsets para esta lingua, em que as palavras tem pertencas difusas, ou seja, fuzzy synsets. Para alem de apresentar a abordagem e a ilustrar com alguns resultados obtidos, baseamo-nos em tres avaliacoes — comparacao com um tesauro criado manualmente para o portugues; comparacao com uma abordagem anterior com o mesmo objetivo; e avaliacao manual — para confirmar que os resultados sao positivos, e poderao no futuro ser expandidos atraves da exploracao de outras fontes de sinonimos.']",1,0

"[""1. Since most Proto-Indo-European *-y%presents are reconstructed with zero-grade of the root and stress on the suffix, and Old IndoAryan presents in -yaand Avestan presents in -iiamostly exhibit reflexes of zero-grade, one would expect Old Persian presents of this type to follow the same pattern of root ablaut.1 Unfortunately, the notorious ambiguity of the OP cuneiform orthography often makes it difficult to determine whether a given formation contains fullor zero-grade. Thus passive forms such as impf. a-g-r-b-i-[y] (DB II 73) 'he was seized', n-i-y-p-i-[6-]i-[y] (DB IV 91) 'it was written down', and a-Q-h-y (DB I 20.23-4, DNa 20, DSe 19), a-6-h-i-y (XPh 18) 'it was said', pres. lpl. 6-h-y-a-m-h-y (DB I 7, DBa) 'we are called' could represent either zero-grade [a-gsrb-iya], [niy-a-pi6-iya], [oah-sya-] (~ [0ah-iya-]) or full-grade [a-grab-iya], [niy-a-pai6-iya], [Ganh-aya-] (~ [6anh-iya-]).2 As for a-j-n-i-y [a-jan-iya] 'was formed' (DSf 29) and a-v-n-i-y [a-vaniya] 'was poured in' (DSf 25.29), these could continue either zero-grade *jn-ya-, *wn-yaor full-grade *jan-ya-, *wan-ya-. Not surprisingly, the classic handbooks leave the question open, or offer conflicting views. In his discussion of Proto-Iranian *-yapresents in OP, Bartholomae (1896: 83) notes simply that [b]ei den Formen aus anund arWurzeln ist es nicht immer moglich zu entscheiden, ob sie hierher oder zu §147 [full-grade + *-ya-] gehoren, da einerseits idg. nn und axn in an, andererseits /r, f und axr zu ar zusammengefallen sind; as an example from a Car root, he gives amariyata 'died'.

We describe his role as that of a glottopolitical vector, i.e. a key figure in the circulation and transformation of knowledge and ideological representations of the languages of Chile and their speakers. We highlight that his arrival to Chile caused a languageideological fracture, as he confronted the hegemony of linguistic normativism and hispanism, established on the basis of the influential works by Andres Bello. His polemical stance towards the dominant ideology explains that the recovering and revaluation of his work is a relatively recent phenomenon, as some of the articles of this special issue show. On the other hand, we warn about the risk of raising hagiographic readings of Lenz without considering the complexity of his context and the role of his works in the scientific, cultural and linguistic policies of his time.']",1,0

Journal of Motor Behavior 14, 97–134] for coordinating diverse space–time scales is considered.']",1,0

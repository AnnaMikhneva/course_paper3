"['Abstract As a phenomenon arising from the interaction of semantics and lexico-grammar, Grammatical Metaphor (GM) occurs in the expression of both ideational and interpersonal meanings. Ideational GM is mainly deployed in written texts, while interpersonal GM is frequently observed in spoken discourses. Previous studies on the phenomenon focus their discussion on ideational GM and the use of GM in English. This study is the first attempt to explore the use of interpersonal GM in spoken Chinese. The study develops a framework for the identification and categorization of interpersonal GM in the language. On the basis of the framework, a large corpus of spontaneous conversation is analyzed to reveal how different types of interpersonal GM are distributed. The analysis shows that spoken Chinese has a preference for certain types of metaphorical expression. This study also investigates the relationship between interpersonal GM in spoken Chinese and its immediate context of situation, demonstrating how the deployment of interpersonal GM is affected by the topic of conversation and the social status between speaker and hearer.']",1,0

"['The Linguistics of Sign Languages: An Introduction, edited by Anne Baker, Beppie van den Bogaerde, Roland Pfau, and Trude Schermer (Amsterdam: Benjamins, 2016, 378 pages, hardbound [$149; ISBN: 9789027212306] and paperback [$54; ISBN: 9789027212313])THIS BOOK and its companion volume (A Concise Lexicon for Sign Linguistics, by Nijen Twilhaar and Beppie van den Bogaerde [Amsterdam: Benjamins, 2016]) are designed to serve as introductory textbooks to the linguistic study of sign languages. The Linguistics of Sign Languages is intended primarily for students of linguistics or those with some background in the field. In that respect it is unique. Introductory linguistics textbooks often include only brief to sign languages (and sometimes with a focus on research on apes). Textbooks designed for students of specific sign languages, on the other hand, concentrate mainly on a single sign language, such as ASL. Thus this book differs from existing linguistics textbooks on sign languages, which are designed chiefly for students in the field.The Linguistics of Sign Languages focuses on typology: similarities and differences among sign languages and between signed and spoken language. Each chapter is written by one or more of the authors, together with other sign language researchers in the Netherlands. Each chapter is followed by a summary, a test yourself  section (e.g., in chapter 1, What is the difference between a gesture and a sign?), an assignments section (e.g., in chapter 4, Construct some short conversations in a sign language that you know that violate the maxims of quantity, quality, and relevance. Present these conversations to others, if possible, in your group and have them work out which maxims are violated.), and a references and further reading section, which summarizes research related to the chapter topic. There is also an associated website (https://benjamins.com/sites/z.199), which provides brief answers to the assignments, video clips of signed examples, a list of Web resources, and a number of references. The test yourself  and assignments sections will be useful to those who are teaching from this book. The website is a welcome innovation, but it contains some infelicities, which I address later.The book comprises fourteen chapters, which are arranged in a somewhat unusual order for an introductory text: Topics such as acquisition and psycholinguistic processing precede any detailed description of sign language structure. Chapter 1, Sign Languages as Natural Languages, introduces sign language, sign languages, and their communities of users. Chapter 2, Psycholinguistics, includes a brief discussion of sign language and the brain and reviews the research studies on sign language production and comprehension. Chapter 3 discusses sign language acquisition in children, and chapter 4 deals with interaction and discourse. The next seven chapters cover the major linguistic areas: Chapter 5, constituents and word classes; chapter 6 and chapter 7, the syntax of simple sentences and complex sentences, respectively; chapter 8, the lexicon (including iconicity and lexicography); chapter 9, morphology; chapter 10, phonetics; and chapter 11, phonology. The final three chapters deal with sign language in its contexts of use. Chapter 12 discusses language variation and standardization, including both linguistic variation and policy issues; and chapter 13 delves into language contact and change. …']",1,0

"['This article aims to investigate how Dutch children may eventually converge on a targetlike distribution of hoeven ‘need,’ a modal verbal NPI (Negative Polarity Item), based on its appearance in the scope of merely some but not all of its possible licensers in the language input (i.e., the induction problem). Imitation performance was obtained from 106 monolingual Dutch children (2;09–5;10; mean = 4;04; SD = 8.5 months) using an elicited imitation task. Results suggest that before age 3, children only accept hoeven to appear with either the sentential negation niet ‘not’ or the negative quantifier geen ‘no.’ After age 3, children start developing their knowledge of the licensing of hoeven in other negative expressions as well—namely niemand ‘nobody,’ weinig ‘few,’ and alleen ‘only’—and eventually allow hoeven in the scope of these negative words after age 5.

"['Student Lexicographers and the Emily Dickinson Lexicon Cynthia L. Hallen JCjmily Dickinson is an ideal subject for lexical studies because her diction derives in important respects from the lexicographical work of Noah Webster, the founding father of American philology and lexicography . Dickinson\'s poems are rich in synonyms, antonyms, metaphors , definitions, etymologies, allusions, and Americanisms. In P[oem] 48,1 an allusion to the prophet Noah embedded in ""Patriarch\'s bird"" probably points toward Webster just as the allusion to Enoch in P 1342 points toward her deceased father, Edward Dickinson. The description of Noah\'s ark as a ""floating casement"" may allude to Webster\'s dictionary. And the allusion to Noah\'s dove in ""Columba"" suggests the distinctive American or Columbian quality of Webster\'s lexicon: Once more, my now bewildered Dove Bestirs her puzzled wings Once more her mistress, on the deep Her troubled question flings — Thrice to die floating casement The Patriarch\'s bird returned, Courage! My brave Columba! There may yet be Land! When Webster published his plan of ""Dictionaries of the American Language"" in 1800, William Dutton objected to the ""Columbian diction1 All references to and quotations from Dickinson\'s poems and letters are taken from die Johnson editions. Reprinted by permission of die publishers and die Trustees of Amherst College from The Poems of Emily Dickinson, Thomas H.

To express disapproval of Webster\'s American dictionary, Dutton proposed a title: ""Let, then, the projected volume of foul and unclean things bear his own christian name and be called NOAH\'S ARK"" (Moss 1984, 99).2 Whether or not Dickinson was aware of the Noah\'s Ark epithet has not been established, but her familiarity with Noah Webster\'s dictionary is incontestable. She used Webster\'s 1844 An American Dictionary of the English Language (ADEL) as a source of poetic inspiration (Benvenuto 1983). In choosing the word patriarch for P 48, Dickinson probably noticed Webster\'s definition of Noachian \'relating to the time of Noah, the patriarch\'. The ""mistress"" of the poem may be a poet, whose big dictionary is \'suggestive of the Ark in respect of size, shape, etc. esp. a large, cumbrous, or old-fashioned trunk or vehicle\' (OED Noah\'s Ark 2). From a menagerie of words, the poet sends out a question into the unknown, hoping to find ""land"" like an ancient Noah,3 or hoping to establish meaning like a Noah Webster. Not only was Webster a ""patriarch"" or founding father of American lexicography (OED patriarch 4), he was also a venerable father in Emily Dickinson\'s hometown of Amherst, Massachusetts (OED patriarch 5). Not long before Dickinson\'s birth in 1830, Webster moved to Amherst to work on his 1828 dictionary (Leavitt 1947, 28). During a tenyear residence, he helped establish Amherst Academy where Dickinson went to secondary school with Emily Ellsworth Fowler Ford, Webster\'s granddaughter and biographer (Sewall 1974, 369). Webster was also a co-founder of Amherst College with Samuel Fowler Dickinson, Emily\'s grandfather (King 1951, 82). Webster prepared and published the new 1841 edition of the ADEL before his death in 1843 (Miles 1991, 2), which was reissued in 1844 by the J. S. and C. Adams company of Amherst (Miles 1993). In 1844, Emily Dickinson\'s father Edward purchased, signed, and dated a copy of the 1844 reprint, which is now a part of the Dickinson family collection in Harvard\'s Houghton Library (Buckingham 1977). Austin Dickinson reports seeing Webster\'s big dictionary on the kitchen table where his sister would sometimes compose (Sewall 2 See the reference to ""Noe"" and the Ark in the 1911 Punch tribute to a new edition of Webster\'s dictionary (Ford 1912, 2. 490).

I suggest that learning has a higher status and different conceptualization in a bio- or eco-semiotic approach than it does in structural linguistics.

"['Abstract Aims The present study investigated whether children with Williams syndrome (WS) produced a higher number of different word roots and low-frequency words in spontaneous speech in a topic controlled setting. Method A group of children with WS was compared to a group of typically developing children matched for chronological age (CA), and a group of typically developing children matched for receptive language abilities (LA). A further comparison was made between the WS group and a group of children matched for non-verbal abilities (NA). Spontaneous speech was elicited using a narrative task. The data were analysed using three different measures of lexical diversity. The results revealed that the children with WS neither produce a higher number of different word roots nor significantly more low-frequency items in comparison to the CA, LA and NA matched participants. Furthermore, language and non-verbal abilities did not predict the number of different and low frequency words used by the typically developing children, however in the WS group non-verbal abilities predicted the number of low-frequency words and receptive language skills predicted the number of different words produced. It is concluded that individuals with WS do not have unusual vocabularies and that the subdomain of language, lexical semantics, does not seem to be an independent cognitive skill.']",1,0

I argue that the D-feature postulated by Chomsky (1995) for Tense and v can be realized in a separate head, namely, on a D, which then licenses pro (along the lines of Torrego (1998)). Focusing on nominative subjects in certain infinitival clauses of Catalan, Italian, and Spanish, I propose that their nominative subjects are licensed by a D with “weak” agreement features in association with Tense. Expletive pro and argumental pro are discussed and it is proposed that the D that licenses the former has no agreement features, whereas the D that licenses the latter has “rich” agreement. A parallel is established between the licensing strategy of “clitic-doubling” and the licensing of argumental pro in infinitival clauses.']",1,0

En este trabajo se estudian algunos casos que se apartan de los patrones de lexicalizacion mencionados para las lenguas de marco verbal y para las de marco satelital y que se caracterizan por la fusion en la raiz verbal del movimiento y la Figura.

In this paper some cases are studied that depart from the lexicalization patterns mentioned for the languages of verbal frame and those of satellite frame and which are characterized by the fusion in the verbal root of the movement and the Figure.

"['Current analyses ( Hu 2005 ; Gerner 2013 ; Liu et al. 2013 ) of Nuosu adjectival comparative constructions are not observationally adequate because they are only based on the semantic distinction between dimensional adjectives and other adjectives. A better analysis should make a further morphological consideration by dividing the Nuosu adjectives into root-sharing prefixed adjectives, non-root-sharing prefixed adjectives and simplex adjectives. Moreover, the existing analyses are not consistent. Some unacceptable comparative sentences in Hu (2005) are acceptable in Gerner (2013) and Liu et al. (2013) . I have found out that the inconsistency results from different rigorousness to adjectival morphosyntactic restrictions among different varieties or dialects of Nuosu. After a cross-dialectal investigation with three major dialects of Nuosu, i.e. Shynra, Yynuo and Suondi, it is concluded that Nuosu comparative constructions have a restricted form and a general form for superiority, inferiority and equality respectively. Different dialects or varieties have varying rigorousness to Nuosu adjectival morphosyntax, thus resulting in different choices of the forms for comparison. Accordingly, the available Nuosu varieties are classified into three types: varieties with more morphosyntactic rigorousness, transitional varieties and varieties with less morphosyntactic rigorousness. It is found that Shynra Nuosu is morphosyntactically less rigorous than Yynuo and Suondi Nuosu. I will also address the relationship between the two structural forms of comparative constructions.

"[""L'objectif de cette etude est d'examiner le role de l'aspect lexical et de la frequence des formes dans l'input dans la production orale des formes du passe par des enfants suedois (âges de 4 a 9 ans) apprenants du francais langue seconde (L2) en immersion. Le role de la frequence dans l'input est souvent neglige dans les etudes sur l'influence de l'aspect lexical tout comme les caracteristiques specifiques des verbes le sont dans les etudes consacrees a l'influence de la frequence des formes. L'analyse de 21 verbes dans l'input puis dans la production des cinq enfants durant les deux premieres annees d'exposition au francais montre un recoupement entre les deux facteurs. Bien que les enfants produisent la plupart des verbes selon leur aspect lexical, les frequences type et d'occurrence dans l'input permettent d'expliquer a la fois le marquage correct du passe ainsi que la variation que l'on trouve dans les groupes de verbes etudies. Les resultats confirment ainsi les predictions d'une approche basee sur l'usage selon laquelle les apprenants construisent leur grammaire a partir de leur experience de l'input. Abstract: The aim of this study is to investigate the role of lexical aspect and input frequency in Swedish children's production of past tense form in spoken L2 French. The children are between 4 and 9 years old and learners of French by immersion in a French school in Sweden. The role of input frequency has often been overlooked in studies on the influence of lexical aspect as well as specific verb characteristics in studies on input frequency. The analysis of 21 verbs in the input and in the production of the five children during the two first years of exposure to French shows that the two factors overlap. Although the children produce most of the verbs as expected from the lexical aspect, type and token frequency in the input explain both the correct past tense marking and the variation found in the group of verbs under investigation. The results confirm the predictions from a usage-based approach, that learners develop their grammar from their experience of input.""]",1,0

"['Abstract This paper aims to explain the formation of the kě and kě yǐ constructions in archaic Chinese. We analyze a number of examples from the pre-Qin era to refute previous hypotheses that the kě construction is formed by adding kě to a notional passive, fronting the object in an active sentence including kě , or solely by reanalysis. Subsequently, a verb-moving-backward hypothesis is proposed: kě is used in the underlying structure ‘ V - O ’ + kě to comment on an already known proposition ‘ V - O ’, then V is moved to the end to avoid the top-heavy problem. Similarly, this hypothesis also accounts for the kě yǐ construction: kě in the underlying structure ‘ yǐ - X - V - Y ’ + kě is to comment on the serial verb structure ‘ yǐ - X - V - Y ’, which is interchangeable with ‘ X - yǐ - V - Y ’ forming ‘ X - yǐ - V - Y ’ + kě where ‘ yǐ - V - Y ’ is moved after kě to avoid the top-heavy problem. Moreover, the “verb moving backward” hypothesis provides new insights into the formation process of similar constructions (e.g., nán 难 ‘be difficult to V ,’ yì 易 ‘be easy to V ,’ zú 足 ‘be sufficient to V ’ constructions) in ancient Chinese, as well as the study of tough constructions.']",1,0

In Spanish, some quantifiers are specified for Number and directly precede the head noun, in contrast to their French counterparts where a dummy preposition de must appear inside the DP. Results from a grammaticality judgement task and a production task show that intermediate and advanced learners perform poorly on plural inflection with some quantifiers, and reject the use of de . This suggests that they have acquired Number specification on these quantifiers, which allows Case marking on the following noun, but do not produce the appropriate morphology. These results support the Separation Hypothesis, but not the Rich Agreement Hypothesis.']",1,0

"['Research on speech prosody has shown that higher-level phonological constituents can be examined directly via their influence on low level phonetic processes ( Beckman and Edwards, 1990 , Fougeron and Keating, 1997 ). Despite the strong tradition of research in this area, the existing work has focused mainly on languages which lack lexical tone. This contributes to the view that prosodic structures show little influence on tone, i.e. a language may either have lexical tone or lexical/phrasal stress, the latter of which fits into the prosodic hierarchy. The current paper examines prosodic focus in Yoloxochitl Mixtec, an endangered Otomanguean language spoken in Mexico. Using experimental data from ten speakers in the field, we investigated how sentence position, stress, and focus type influenced the realization of F0 and duration in different tonal melodies. The findings show that the tonal F0 space was expanded and raised on words produced with contrastive focus, less on words produced with narrow focus, and least on words produced under broad, sentential focus. Focus-related lengthening asymmetrically affected stressed syllables in the language more than unstressed syllables. In stressed syllables, this resulted in an increase in tonal hyperarticulation.']",1,0

It is based on the slides from his talk and various teaching materials, of which some figures have been translated from German to English before their inclusion in this article. While this article’s foundation rests on Schulze’s theories and research, we have done our best to build upon his work; direct quotes and key concepts of his will be cited throughout the text. Schulze intended to write this article himself, but after his unexpected passing in early 2020, we decided to offer this contribution on his behalf. Research on taboo is widely spread across diverse academic disciplines that each attribute slightly, yet noticeably, different meanings to the concept. This article proposes an all-encompassing definition applicable to all socio-cultural contexts. To arrive at this comprehensive understanding, we first briefly survey the history of taboo and its linguistic study. Then, we present a formal and functional typology of circumnavigating taboos, taking into account the concepts of mana and noa as proposed by Schulze ( 2019 : 13, 15, 16). While the specific social restrictions resulting from tabooed relations vary from community to community, the purpose of taboo remains the same: social stability, protection and sustainability. Linguistic taboos contribute to these social functions by restricting the use of certain linguistic signs in certain situations. Such constraints necessitate strategies for avoiding taboo, including articulation shift, lexical substitution and the emergence of special languages, detailed here.']",1,0

Recent research in language acquisition suggests that an important factor causing the difference between child L1 and adult L2 acquisition is the capacity to engage in complex verbal tasks. Thus, the construction of discourse (with its conceptual and linguistic complexities) seems constrained in the adult L2 case mainly by a lack of linguistic means; in the child L1 case by the gradual development of conceptual and communicative capacities. We tested this hypothesis by analysing reference to space in two tasks, a narrative and a description, as produced by child L1 and adult L2 learners of various source and target languages. Results confirm the hypothesis, and show that whereas both types of learners adapt to language-specific means available in the target, children have more problems conceptually with the task, whereas adults can compensate for their linguistic problems, given their understanding of the communicative situation.""]",1,0

"['Opsomming Internasionaal bekroonde skrywer en digter Antjie Krog, skryf in Afrikaans, haar moedertaal, vertaal ander se werk (Nederlands en Vlaams) in Afrikaans, en vertaal haar eie werk (saam met ander vertalers) in Engels. As tweetalige en veeltalige skrywer werk Krog voortdurend op ’n dialogiese en heteroglossiese vlak binne ’n komplekse sosiokulturele en sosiolinguistiese omgewing. Met die skep van tekste wat twee- of veelstemmig is, stel Krog veranderende betekenisse en ontvanklikheid vir verskillende perspektiewe aan die leser bekend – ’n proses wat dikwels haarself, haar taal en ander se taal ontheem of vervreem. Hierdie artikel ondersoek die abjekte soos dit in Krog se teenwoordigheid as selfvertaler en vertaalde skrywer in die Suid-Afrikaanse literere veld manifesteer. Die abjekte – dit wat onvanpas en vuil is en die geordende sisteem bedreig – is die duidelikste teenwoordig in ons (as subjektiewe persone) reaksies op die fisiese liggaam en die moontlikhede van kontaminasie wat dit inhou. Die skryfproses en die inhoud daarvan, kan en behoort op soortgelyke wyse as ontwrigtende handelinge te funksioneer. Die konsep van die materialiteit van die teks is spesifiek relevant tot Krog se eie poesie, wat ’n abjekte, beliggaamde landskap voorstel. As skrywer bewoon ( inhabit ) Krog die teks – sy word die ritmes en artikulasies van die teks. Binne kulturele vertaling, vorm abjeksie en die mineuraanwending van taal ’n integrale deel van die konstruksie van identiteit en subjektiwiteit. Hierdie abjeksie funksioneer op twee vlakke: aan die een kant is Krog se teenwoordigheid binne die Engelse literere veld ambivalent, onstabiel en uitdagend van ’n skoon, geordende sisteem; aan die ander kant ondermyn sy die majeurtaal deur haarself met subversiwiteit te vertaal. Die doel van die artikel is om die konsepte abjeksie en mineurtaal te versoen in ’n poging om ’n vars perspektief te gee op die persepsie en resepsie van Krog se werk in die Suid-Afrikaanse literere veld.\xa0 Translation and/as abjection: Antjie Krog Extended abstract Internationally acclaimed South African author and poet Antjie Krog writes in Afrikaans, her mother tongue, translates others’ work (Dutch and Flemish) into Afrikaans, and together with other translators, translates her own work into English. As bilingual or multilingual writer in a complex sociocultural and sociolinguistic environment, Krog continually operates at a dialogic and heteroglossic level. In producing texts that are double-voiced or multi-voiced, she introduces differing meanings and openness to different perspectives, often defamiliarising herself, her own and others’ language, and the reader.\xa0 This paper seeks to address the notion of the abject as manifest in Krog’s presence as self-translator as well as in her presence as translated writer in the South African literary field. The abject – that which is improper, unclean, threatening the orderly system – is most prevalent in our (subjective beings’) reactions to the physical form of the body and its contaminative possibilities. In a similar vein, writing and its contents, could, and does, function as destabilising acts. The notion of the materiality of the text is particularly relevant to Krog’s own poetry, as her work exhibits an abject, embodied landscape. As writer, Krog inhabits the text and becomes the rhythms and articulations of the text. “God, Death, Love, Loneliness, Man / are important Themes in Literature / menstruation, childbirth, menopause, puberty / marriage are not,” Krog writes in Body bereft (BB 20), highlighting, to a large extent, what Mansfield calls “fantasies of an autonomous selfhood” (Kristeva in Mansfield 2000:82):\xa0 “... we draw an imaginary line around the perimeters of our bodies and define our subjectivity as the unique density of matter contained within that line.” This dilemma experienced by the subject could have an additional dimension, namely, “In our fantasy of an autonomous literature or autonomous language […] we draw an imaginary line around the perimeters of our literature and define our literature/language as the unique density of matter contained within that line.” The latter interpretation of Kristeva links to Deleuze and Guattari’s work on minor literature, specifically the hidden potential of a minor use of a major language. Krog’s poem also echoes Christiane Rochefort’s description of the struggle in terms of freedom of the (French) women writer:\xa0 “You are supposed, too,” she writes (Rochefort in Jones 1997:380), “to write about certain things: house, children, love. […] Maybe you don’t want to write about , but to write, period. And of course, you don’t want to obey this social order. So, you tend to react against it” (italics in original). Krog’s oeuvre in the Afrikaans and English literary field in South Africa consists of Afrikaans poetry volumes, prose, prose translations from English and Dutch, and translations of her own and others’ poetry. Her first non-fiction book is published in 1995 ( Relaas van ’n moord; Account of a murder , 1997), followed by her first publication in English in 1998, Country of my skull . Thereafter followed the autobiographical/fictional work A change of tongue (2003; published in 2005 as ’n Ander tongval ), her most recent non-fiction book being Begging to be black (2009). With Country of my skull and A change of tongue Krog acquired international status, but mostly made the transition to bilingual or multilingual writer occupying the interesting yet ambivalent space of hybridity, heterotopias and the cosmopolitan. In 1995 she started working as translator of Nelson Mandela’s autobiography into Afrikaans, followed by various translations and anthologies; the most recent being her second anthology in English translation, Skinned (2013). It is argued that in translating her own work from Afrikaans, a minoritised language post-1994, into a language of power, English, Krog abjectifies the major language, thereby creating a delicate space in the target cultural field: a space where the language is double, vague, heterogeneous, metamorphosed, deterritorialised, reterritorialised; a space where her translations open up “revolutionary conditions […] within the heart of what is called great (or established) literature” (Deleuze & Guattari 1986:18). Entering the Afrikaans literary field at a stage where it was a major (institutionalised) literature in South Africa, Krog’s style was less conventional and her subject matter daring. With Country of my skull , A change of tongue and Down to my last skin , Krog moved from minor (Afrikaans) to major language, utilising a type of English (South African, with heavy Afrikaans undertones) that constitutes a minor use of the major language (see Pakendorf 1993). In Krog’s approach to retain the Afrikaans undertones she manages to keep alive the contact zone between Afrikaans and English as a space of multiple articulations where language need not function as a defining or limiting border. It is perhaps safe to position Krog in a hybrid space within the English literary field. This in-between space, or third space , presents itself as uncomfortable and revealing, and as symptomatic of the tension between two more defined spaces from the English reader’s perspective: the one known, global, intimidating, levelling (English), the other unknown or foreign (Afrikaans), yet local. In Deleuze and Guattari’s framework, innovation or novelty in language usage is what opposes the attraction of a higher, dominant order, creating a new literary continent or space that is neither conformist nor idealistic. On the level of the abject, Krog creates such a space in Country of my skull and A change of tongue , and again in Verweerskrif and Body bereft , paving the way for the conceptualization of an international and cosmopolitan culture based on the inscription and articulation of cultural hybridity. Moreover, she views translation as the transformation of one text from a powerless language into a powerful one; the transformation of a powerful text that was made powerless by a powerless language, becoming empowered in and through the powerful language (Krog 2002b:2). As forms of textual and cultural translation, abjection and minoritisation form an integral part in the construction of identity and subjectivity. This abjection is operative on two levels: on the one hand Krog’s presence in the English literary field is ambivalent, unstable and daring to a clean, orderly system; on the other hand she undermines the major language by translating herself and her non-orderly self with subversion. The aim of this paper is to merge the concepts of minoritisation and abjection in an attempt to bring a fresh perspective on the perception and reception of Krog’s work in the South African literary field.']",1,0
"[""To explore whether Deaf Hispanics identify more strongly with their Hispanic heritage or with American Deaf culture, theoretical propositions and research findings on three main themes are pre- sented: ethnic identity, the development of a unified Deaf popula- tion, and the development of a Southwestern US Hispanic identity. To examine the convergence of these three a body of data was collected, using in-depth interviews based on ethnographic phi- losophies, framed elicitations, and questionnaires. The Grounded Theory of Strauss and Corbin (1990) was used to analyze the data. Findings were, not unexpectedly, equivocal. According to objective definitions, Deaf Hispanics may be both Hispanic and Deaf. According to subjective definitions, they may be neither. Ac- cording to their own perceptions of identity, however, the partici- pants in this study are both, with (in most cases) a stronger bond to the Deaf ethnic group. Ethnic Identity Helen Keller has been credited with the observation that blind- ness separates a person from things, but deafness separates a per- son from other people. Just as geographical separation con- tributes to the homogenous development of specific languages and cultures; so too, communicative separation of American deaf people from people with intact hearing has resulted in two dis- tinct populations, each with its own language and culture. These populations are here labeled Deaf' and hearing, and these descriptive terms in American Sign Language refer to a powerful conceptual difference. Understanding the gulf between the two is crucial to understanding group identification and the intercultural communication conflicts that inevitably arise. Misunderstandings can occur during any interpersonal inter- action, when one or more participants make an assumption that meanings reside solely in words, or that we all base our commu- nication on similar levels of perception.

"['espanolA partir de un corpus compuesto integramente por textos de inmediatez comunicativa, el presente estudio analiza un fenomeno de variacion que enfrento a los adverbios asi y ansi durante los Siglos de Oro. En el marco de la sociolinguistica historica, el analisis de regresion logistica de efectos mixtos efectuado muestra que la forma vernacula ansi gozo de un considerable exito durante buena parte de este periodo, si bien conocio un momento culminante entre 1540 y 1620. Sin embargo, a partir de entonces, los usos del adverbio irian descendiendo bruscamente hasta cerrar la centuria con empleos que hacian presagiar ya la censura a la que el adverbio iba a ser sometido a partir del siglo XVIII. Otro resultado relevante es que, en la difusion de ansi, cobraron especial importancia algunos factores extralinguisticos en mucha mayor medida que los linguisticos, un hecho poco habitual entre las variables gramaticales, aunque explicable en este caso por el componente morfo-lexico que presenta este hecho de variacion. Los factores mas destacados fueron de caracter dialectal –la principal distribucion de la forma vernacula tuvo lugar en las areas centro-meridionales de la Peninsula, asi como en las comunidades americanas– y sociolectal, con una preferencia mayor por ansi entre los estratos bajos, seguidos por los intermedios y a distancia de las elites, las cuales se mostraron siempre mas reacias a su empleo, especialmente a partir del siglo XVII. EnglishBased on a corpus of communicative immediacy texts, the present study analyzes the variation between the adverbs ansi and asi during the Golden Age Spanish period. Within the framework of historical sociolinguistics, the mixed-effects logistic regression analysis carried out shows that the vernacular form ansi enjoyed considerable success during this period, although it reached its peak between 1540 and 1620. However, from the latter date onwards, the uses of the adverb declined sharply until the end of the century, foreshadowing the negative attitudes to which ansi was exposed from the 18th century onwards. Another meaningful result of the study is that, in the diffusion of ansi, some extralinguistic factors took on special relevance to a much greater extent than the linguistic ones, an unusual fact among grammatical variables, perhaps explainable in this case by the important morpho-lexical component that this variation represents. The most relevant factors were of a dialectal –the main distribution of the vernacular form took place in the central-southern areas of Spain, as well as in the American speech communities– and sociolectal nature, with a greater preference for ansi among the lower strata, followed by the intermediate ones, and both of them a long way from the social elites. These elites were always more reluctant to use the vernacular form, especially from the middle of the Seventeenth century onwards.']",1,0

Peak intraoral air pressure ( P 0 ), duration of consonantal closure ( D c ) and peak r.m.s. sound pressure associated with the consonantal release ( P b ) for selected English plosives were obtained from the recordings. Systematic changes in aerodynamic parameters associated with a conversational context vs citation contexts were probed. Intraoral pressures were found to be comparable to published values for plosives in syllable- and sentence-contexts, and voiceless plosives were consistently produced with greater magnitudes of P 0 than were voiced plosives.

"['Carleton Taylor Hodge Alan S. Kaye How vividly I recall the feeling of eager anticipation looking forward to the well-organized and informative lectures Professor Carleton Hodge presented in his ‘Structure of Ancient Egyptian’ course at the Linguistic Society of America (LSA) Linguistic Institute of the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor during the summer of 1965. I was a graduate student in linguistics at the University of California, Berkeley at the time, taking his and three other courses. Little did I imagine then that he and I would maintain a lively correspondence from that summer on for the next thirty-three years, nor did I expect that we would come to spend so much time together at the joint annual meetings of the American Oriental Society and the North American Conference on Afroasiatic Linguistics, which we would regularly attend for a quarter of a century. We also lectured on each other’s campuses, and I took great delight that many of my fellow Californians personally came to appreciate not only his scholarship (Hodge 1991a and 1991c), but also his charming and celebrated wit and sense of humor. Hodge was born on November 27, 1917 to Clarence Sim and Nina (Eaton) Hodge in Springfield, Illinois, where he was raised. He died on September 8, 1998 at the age of eighty at his home in Bloomington, Indiana, where he was Professor Emeritus of Linguistics and Anthropology at Indiana University (IU).1 He left Illinois in 1935 to attend Depauw University in Greencastle, Indiana, as a Rector Scholar. In those days, he was interested in biblical studies and majored in Greek and Latin, receiving his A.B. Phi Beta Kappa in 1939. During his sophomore year, however, he decided to become a linguist, since he was much influenced (especially at informal Saturday night meetings on anthropological linguistics) by a new member of the Depauw faculty, Charles (Carl) F. Voegelin, Professor of Anthropology. Voegelin was to become Hodge’s lifelong friend, mentor, and colleague at IU. At Voegelin’s urging, Hodge attended the linguistic institutes at the University of Michigan in 1938,2 1939, and 1940, studying with such giants as Edgar Sturtevant, Roland G. Kent, Franklin Edgerton, and Voegelin himself, who taught field methods courses using Delaware and Ojibway. In addition, Hodge was fortunate enough to hear lectures by Leonard Bloomfield. Hodge began his graduate career in linguistics and Oriental studies in fall 1939, at the University of Pennsylvania (where he was a Harrison Scholar and later Fellow) studying with such luminaries as E. A. Speiser (Akkadian, Hebrew, and Urartean), Giorgio Della Vida (Arabic), and W. Norman Brown (Sanskrit). He completed his dissertation under Zellig S. Harris on Hausa (published as Hodge 1947) receiving the Ph.D. in linguistics in 1943. Later that year on June 2, he married Patricia E. Sutcliffe, with whom he had four children.3 They were a devoted couple, and attended many [End Page 156] linguistic conferences together, where they could often be seen walking together in and around the hotel. I fondly recall speaking with her at many of those. Hodge’s first home and position were, strangely enough, in Bloomington, Indiana, where he would later spend most of his career. He was hired by IU for 1943–44 as an instructor of Serbo-Croatian and Bulgarian in the Army Specialized Training Program. The next two years took him to the University of Maryland, College Park, back to the University of Pennsylvania, and to New York City where he worked on the aforementioned Slavic languages and also on Japanese. He was asked to supervise classes in Japanese which used a prepublication version of a manual on the language by Bernard Bloch and Eleanor Harz Jordan. In the fall of 1946 he joined the U.S. State Department, which had a program for foreign service officers, headed by Henry Lee Smith, Jr. Hodge worked for the next sixteen years on pedagogical materials using informants of Bulgarian, Modern Greek, Hausa (Hodge 1963b), Persian (both Iranian and Afghan dialects), Serbo-Croatian, and Turkish, and also served as the editor of FSI language materials (the Foreign Service Institute [FSI] was created by the Foreign Service Act of 1946).

"['This paper is concerned with the special nature of Sign Language verbs, in particular to this research, Irish Sign Language (ISL) verbs. We use Role and Reference Grammar (RRG) (Van Valin 2005) to provide a definition of the structure of lexical entries that are sufficiently rich and universal in nature to represent ISL verbs. This work is part of research work in the development of a linguistically motivated computational framework for ISL. We use RRG (Van Valin and LaPolla 1997) as the theoretical framework of this study. RRG takes language to be a system of communicative social action, and accordingly, analysing the communicative functions of grammatical structures plays a vital role in grammatical description and theory from this perspective (Van Valin 2005). Using RRG provides significant theoretical and technical challenges within both RRG and software.&#x0D; We provide an account of the morphological and grammatical information that can be found within ISL verbs. We use the Signs of Ireland corpus (SOI) to access the relevant linguistic data pertinent to ISL (Leeson et al, 2006). Further to this we use ELAN software as an application tool, which allows us to view the corpus and collate relevant linguistic phenomena pertinent to ISL. We utilise the Event Visibility Hypothesis (EVH) (Wilbur 2008) in the development of our proposed lexicon architecture. We refer to Articulatory Structure Level (Murtagh 2018) in the development of a linguistically motivated computational definition of lexicon entries that are sufficiently robust in nature to represent ISL verbs within the RRG lexicon. We utilise this new level of lexical representation (Pustejovsky 1995), which describes the essential (computational) phonological parameters of an object as defined by the lexical item to cater specifically for the computational linguistic phenomena consistent with signed languages, in particular to this research ISL, enabling us to provide an adequate account of ISL verbs within the RRG lexicon.']",1,0

"['espanolAl menos desde la primera mitad del siglo XX, una disyuntiva interrogo a distintas figuras de la ciencia espanola e hispanoamericana: si comunicar sus hallazgos en revistas y lenguas extranjeras con el fin de ampliar su difusion, o bien apelar al espanol y, aun con las limitaciones que ello implicaba, apostar a la trascendencia de sus investigaciones en lengua nacional. En el ensayo “La ciencia y el idioma” (1937), el medico Pio del Rio Hortega fundamenta la importancia patriotica de difundir en espanol y discute con aquellos que optan por hacerlo en idiomas extranjeros, por caso, los medicos e investigadores Santiago Ramon y Cajal y Bernardo Houssay (Premio Nobel en 1906 y 1957, respectivamente). El presente articulo aborda las consideraciones de Rio Hortega, analiza sus fundamentaciones y, paralelamente, establece un dialogo con las posturas de Cajal y de Houssay. El trabajo se inscribe en una perspectiva glotopolitica, cuyo proposito es el estudio de las intervenciones en el espacio publico del lenguaje (Arnoux y Del Valle 2010), perspectiva operativa para indagar las distintas representaciones sobre el espanol como lengua de la ciencia. En este enfoque, los textos son analizados como discursos, es decir, en tanto formulados en condiciones historicas de produccion, por lo que su indagacion implica un estudio simultaneo y reciproco de sus dimensiones verbales y sociohistoricas (Maingueneau 2012). Adelantamos que en la palabra de Rio Hortega puede leerse una temprana advertencia sobre el proceso de minorizacion linguistica del espanol en la esfera cientifica, que sus contribuciones terminologicas pueden ser consideradas como una expresion de su posicionamiento, y que las posturas aqui formuladas anticipan interrogantes que actualmente interpelan a aquellos investigadores que producen su labor desde lenguas diferentes o espacios distantes de las grandes potencias cientificas. EnglishAt least since the first half of the 20th century a quandary confronted different figures of Spanish and Hispano-American science: whether to communicate their findings in foreign journals and languages in order to widen their diffusion, or to resort to Spanish and, even with the limitations that that implied, to take a chance on the transcendence of their investigations in the national tongue. In his essay “La ciencia y el idioma” (1937), the physician Pio del Rio Hortega substantiates the patriotic importance of disseminating in Spanish and debates with those that decide to do it in foreign languages, such as the physicians and researchers Santiago Ramon y Cajal and Bernardo Houssay (Nobel Prize in 1906 and 1957 respectively). The present article addresses the considerations of Rio Hortega, analyses their foundations and, simultaneously, engages in dialogue with the positions of Cajal and Houssay. This work is grounded in a glotopolitical perspective whose purpose is the study of interventions in the public space of language (Arnoux and Del Valle 2010), an operative perspective to inquire into the different representations of Spanish as the language of science. From this perspective, texts are analysed as discourse, that is to say, as formulated in historical conditions of production, which means that their inquiry implies a simultaneous and reciprocal study of their verbal and sociohistorical dimensions (Mangueneau 2012). We anticipate that in the words of Rio Hortega there can be read an early warning on the process of linguistic minorization of Spanish in the scientific sphere, that his terminological contributions can be considered an expression of his positioning, and that the positions here formulated anticipate interrogations that currently question those researchers that carry out their work in different languages or places distant from great scientific powers.']",1,0

"['Dean S. Worth In Memoriam Henning Andersen The Slavic linguistics community lost one of its great leaders in 2016. Dean Stoddard Worth, who lived in retirement in Lititz, Pennsylvania, passed away after a long illness on 29 February at the age of 88 years. Worth, who was born in Brooklyn, NY in 1927, earned his BA at Dartmouth College, studied Slavic languages in Paris at the École nationale des langues vivantes and at the Sorbonne (Diploma and Certificat 1952) and went on to Harvard, where he completed the PhD in 1956 with a dissertation on a problem in Russian syntax, written under the supervision of Roman Jakobson. In 1957 he hired on at UCLA, where he rose through the ranks, retiring in 1994. During his career Worth made significant contributions in Russian linguistics, descriptive as well as historical, with early publications on syntactic problems and numerous papers on morphophonemics and morphology, especially word formation. In many other studies he applied linguistic analysis to Russian texts from all periods, chronicles as well as literary, from the Igor’ Tale to Kantemir. He produced more than a dozen papers on rime and metrics, both in classical and in oral literature, where he showed a special interest in the Russian lament. His many studies of the language of these many text types from different periods formed the background for contributions to our understanding of the historical development of the Russian literary language. Besides publications in Russian linguistics, Worth wrote several studies of the southern Kamchatka language Kamchadal (Russian Itel’men). He also edited and coedited several conference volumes and was editor of the International Journal of Slavic Linguistics and Poetics from its first issue (1959) to its last (2006). In between he wrote some fifty reviews, about a quarter of the items in his list of publications. Two collections of Worth’s research articles were published (1977, 2006). The latter lists his publications through 2004. Among Worth’s book-length publications are a volume of edited Kamchadal texts, a Kamchadal dictionary, a Russian derivational dictionary (1970), a bibliography of Russian word formation (1977), a two-volume bibliography of Slavic linguistics (1966, 1970), and a monograph on the development of Russian grammar writing (1983). At UCLA Worth played a decisive role in his department’s development into a preeminent center of Slavic studies, the result of judicious hiring and a [End Page 269] stream of visiting lecturers and professors from Slavic countries. He served several terms as department chair, as director of the Advisory Committee of the UCLA Center for Russian and East European Studies, as well as on a variety of campus-wide committees. Beyond the walls of the university, Worth served on, and at times chaired, both the American and the International Committee of Slavists and at various times was a consultant to the RAND Corporation, the National Science Foundation, the American Council of Learned Societies, and the Social Sciences Research Council. Over the years Worth was awarded research funding from the John S. Guggenheim Memorial Foundation, the International Research and Exchange Board, the National Science Foundation, and the National Endowment for the Humanities. In 1984 he was awarded the UCLA College of Letters and Science Prize for Outstanding Achievement in Teaching, Research, and Service. In 1992 he received the Award for Outstanding Achievement in Scholarship from the American Association of Teachers of Slavic and East European Languages. He was honored by colleagues with a Festschrift to celebrate his 65th birthday, and former students marked his 70th birthday and 40th anniversary at UCLA with a Festschrift for him in 1997. His students and colleagues will remember him for his high standards in teaching and scholarship, his generosity, his hospitality, and his spirit of conviviality.

An analysis based on the discrete classification of / s / variants shows that a combination of linguistic factors (following consonant and stress) influences / s / realization. An analysis based on the phonetic coding of / s / variants (using measures of fricative duration, relative voicing, and center of gravity) reveals the extent to which velar fricatives display an intermediate status along the phonetic continuum of / s / lenition variations.

Can non-natives outperform natives on speech discrimination? Surprisingly, Cantonese listeners discriminated English stress more accurately than did English listeners. To ascertain its generalizability, I further ask whether this Cantonese advantage in English stress discrimination is equally potent across pitch accent and vowel reduction contexts. Sixty Cantonese and English listeners completed four blocks of English stress discrimination task with varying pitch accent and vowel reduction contexts. In the absence of rising pitch accent pattern and vowel reduction, the Cantonese listeners outperformed the English listeners on English stress discrimination. However, the Cantonese advantage disappeared when either rising pitch accent pattern or vowel reduction was present. When both rising pitch accent pattern and vowel reduction were present, the Cantonese listeners even performed poorer than the English listeners. The findings underscore two constraints of the Cantonese advantage in English stress discrimination—rising pitch accent pattern and vowel reduction. Based on collective research on non-native advantage in speech perception, the Acoustic-Attentional-Contextual hypothesis is proposed.']",1,0

"['The practice of citation is indicative of academic discourse. Over the last two decades, a number of papers have explored the language of citation, some directly motivated by concern about poor citation practices among student writers. This emerging interest has given us detailed understanding of specific aspects of citation language, for example verb tense, thematic choice, voice, and the name of the cited author (eg. Swales 1986, Thompson and Ye 1991, Shaw 1992, Thomas and Hawes 1994a, Thomas and Hawes 1994b). However, we do not yet have a tool for analysing citation in terms of the underlying intertextual understandings of academic writers. This paper proposes a model of citation options which relates variation in citation language forms to writers’ ability to control how they position themselves and their texts within a multi-member colloquy that is the academic community, past, present and future. Academic writers use variation in citation language to present knowledge as more or less negotiable, and in so doing control their readers’ engagement on points of controversy. The model is potentially valuable both pedagogically and for analysing specific discourse issues, within and across academic disciplines.']",1,0

In this paper, we develop two new robust methods for energy-based speech demodulation and compare their performance on both test and actual speech signals. The first method uses smoothing splines for discrete-to-continuous signal approximation. The second (and best) method uses time-derivatives of Gabor filters. Further, we apply the best demodulation method to explore the statistical distribution of speech modulation features and study their properties regarding applications of speech classification and recognition. Finally, we present some preliminary recognition results and underline their improvements when compared to the corresponding MFCC results.']",1,0
"['Letter from the Editor David F. Armstrong This issue of Sign Language Studies begins with two articles commemorating the ninetieth anniversary (July 21, 2009) of the birth of William C. Stokoe, the journal’s founder, and the tenth anniversary of his passing (April 4, 2010). The articles are reprinted from The Study of Signed Languages, a volume of essays produced in celebration of his eightieth birthday. These articles are followed by a commentary piece concerning interpretations (and misinterpretations) of Bill’s seminal concept, “semantic phonology.” Next are two articles that deal with one of the principal preoccupations of his life’s work—the possible impact of signed languages on the education of deaf children. Fittingly, these articles describe educational programs in two widely separated parts of the world: the United States and Argentina. The first article, by Cynthia Bailes and her colleagues, draws quite literally on Bill’s legacy—its preparation was supported by income from a generous gift of an endowment to Gallaudet University, which he made just before his death. (Those wishing to support the William C. Stokoe Jr. Chair of Ethnographic Studies in Deaf Language and Culture should contact the Gallaudet Development Office.) The issue ends with a review of a book that might seem, at first glance, like an odd choice for this journal. It was chosen for two reasons: It gives a slight nod in the direction of Bill’s early career as a scholar of English literature, and it deals with an important discussion, however flawed, of the underlying role of vision and visual representation in the development of human language and poetry. We believe that those familiar with the body of Stokoe’s work will see the connection. More generally, we hope that readers will find this issue a fitting tribute to a most distinguished and influential human being. [End Page 388] Copyright © 2009 Gallaudet University']",1,0

He was always eager to help and assist and was well respected by all who knew him and through his work those who did not know him. Dick was born in Toledo, Ohio on July 21, 1925. He moved to Washington, D.C in 1936 when his father was appointed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt as advisor to the National Resources Board. Dick earned an A.B. in 1948 and an M.A. in 1949 each from George Washington University. In 1955, Dick received his Ph.D. from Clark University (Worcester, Massachusetts). He also studied in 1953 and 1954 as a Fulbright Scholar at the University of Graz in Austria. Dick served his nation in the 94th Infantry during World War II where he was awarded the Combat Infantryman Badge and received the Bronze Star and four Battle Stars. Dick’s career was always in various aspects of geography and cartography specializing in map editing, quality assurance, and applied toponymy. Although Dick began his career formally with the Central Intelligence Agency, he spent much of 1943 with the Alaska Branch of the U.S. Geological Survey interpreting aerial photographs. He began his formal career at the Central Intelligence Agency where he worked from 1955 to 1961 specializing in editing and later as a specialist in matters of Eastern Europe. In 1961 he became the representative in Washington, D.C. for Rand McNally & Company where he was instrumental in overseeing data collection for Rand McNally’s extensive line of products. His work was highlighted in 1969 when he designed the series of maps showing the world’s oceans and water bodies for inclusion in Rand McNally’s Cosmopolitan Atlas of the World. In 1973, Dick became The Geographer at the Defense Mapping Agency (now National-Geospatial Intelligence Agency) where some of his responsibilities included the foreign geographic names program for the federal government and serving as the Executive Secretary of the U.S. Board on Geographic Names. He retired from his professional career at the Defense Mapping Agency in 1993, but remained active in various professional organizations including the American Congress on Surveying and Mapping where he established its press relations program in 1966 and the Association of American Geographers where he was heavily involved with that organization’s Careers in Geography Program.

The operation of P AL - e is opaque, due to the interaction with a depalatalisation process applying before [ε]. The analysis establishes four points of theoretical interest. First, from a typological perspective, P AL - e parallels P AL - i , postulated by Rubach (2000a) for Russian, which strengthens the contention that P AL constraints should be stated as agreement constraints that bring under the same denominator the palatalisation of consonants and the fronting of vowels. Second, the opacity of o -fronting cannot be analysed by appealing to M AX [F] constraints. Third, sympathy theory cannot handle the data either.

Roques simply defines 'chemin de ronde'I; Suchier, too, has it as 'Gang auf der Festungsmauer' implying, however, that a technical connotation might be involved2. It is the purpose of this note to explain what the last named editor fails to explain, namely just what this connotation is. In our citation, it is evident that there is a contrast offered as to the method of protection adopted by the soldiers and the bourgeoisie. The former put on armor. This is the force we may rightly attach to s'armer, knowing that in OF armes could refer as well to defensive as to offensive equipment. The civilian population is not thus protected. These men are surely not to fight exposed to the arrows or crossbolts of the enemy without other protection than the crenelated breastwork. They take refuge, says the text, in the aleoirs, which cannot, then, refer to the almost open road on top of the walls. This is the situation as explained by a noted French archaeologist:3 'Le chemin de ronde qui surmonte les remparts 4tait quelquefois 6largi au moyen d'encorbeillements, A l'extdrieur par des hourds ou des machicoulis, 1'int6rieur par un encorbeillement de pierre, une galerie ou coursiere de bois, couverte d'un toit qui protege les d6fenseurs contre les projectiles lanc6s audessus du parapet.' Coursiere is in all likelihood equivalent to the aleoir, for it would seem to be derived from course, substantive of courir; see, for instance, Du Cange, s.v.

The data for this study draws on a qualitative interactional study of Congolese youth in Cape Town, South Africa. These youth form part of a migration class that have shaped immigration sociolinguistic practices in the Global South. They arrived in South Africa at a young age with their parents and have to date been significantly exposed to the local sociocultural dynamics of language and identity practices and negotiations. In this paper we demonstrate that the task faced by these young migrants is to immerse in education, peer and cultural networks and practices that help shape their new identities in the host country, and sustain links to their country of origins (Congo).']",1,0

"['A HEBREW THEORY CONCERNING THE BALTIC LANGUAGES IN THE CONTEXT OF 16TH C. PALAEOCOMPARATIVISM AND A RELATED ENIG\xadMATIC TEXTSummaryIn the wider context of the history of the linguistic ideas concerning the Baltic languages, and espe\xadcially of the Palaeocomparativism of the 16th century, we should also like to present and comment on the idea that the Baltic languages derive from the Hebrew language (this theory completes the picture I already tried to give in a series of papers on the Slavic, Roman, Fourfold, Greek and other linguistic theories).The main authors and works related to this idea in the 16th c. are: Johannes Funck (1518-1566) and his Chronologia ab orbe condito (Nürinberg, 1545; Königsberg, 1552, 1566; Wittenberg 1578); Severin Göbel (1530-1612) and his works: De Succino Libri Duo (1565), Einfeitiger Jedoch gründtlicher Bericht vnd Bedencken, Vom vrsprung des Agadt oder Bernsteins... (1616); Johannes Loewenklau (1537-1593) and his works Annales Sultanorum Othmanidarum (Frankfurt am Main, 1588), Neuwe Chronica Tiirckischer nation (Frankfurt am Main, 1590).Loewenklau (1588) quotes the enigmatic text Ieru Ieru Masco Lon, which was repeated with some variants in later editions and by other authors of that time. The text has resisted until now many attempts at an explanation (M. Praetorius, Ph. Ruhig, X. Bohusz). Previous explanations of the text are discussed in this paper and a new interpretation is proposed.

The method of reconstruction of associative fields is used to reveal general thematic categories, which include the most frequent associations (the core of associative fields). The analysis is based on the data of French associative dictionary DAF (Institute of Linguistics, RAS in cooperation with NSU). The conclusion emphasizes that the French title Le Coeur et La Raison (by J. Castier and P. Goubert) is the most relevant one among the French translations.

"[""ONE OF THE CONTROVERSIAL ISSUES in study of black English has been verb morphology, particularly synchronic status and diachronic provenance of paradigmatically related present tense verb endings -s and zero. The observation that third person singular -s is frequently deleted by lower class black speakers has lead to assumption that the third singular present tense marker is not required in black dialect (Lanier 1976, p. 51; cf. Funkhouser 1973, pp. 809-10, 819; Fickett 1972, p. 17; Loflin, Sobin, and Dillard 1973, p. 24; Smitherman 1977, p. 26). This view was originally offered by creolists in connection with creole substratum hypothesis, which suggests a creole origin of dialects spoken by blacks in United States (cf. e.g., Dillard 1972, pp. 40-42; Traugott 1976, p. 88); for use of uninflected verb forms is typical of pidgin and creole languages, e.g., Gullah (Turner 1949, p. 224; Van Sertima 1976, p. 141), Haitian Creole (Hall 1966, p. 109) and West African Pidgin English (Grade 1892, p. 383), which reveals influence of African languages (Turner 1948, p. 78; cf. Hall 1966, p. 109; Van Sertima 1976, p. 141). By virtue of results of recent sociolinguistic research, which has shown uninflected verb to be predominant third person singular form in black English, this hypothesis has obtained considerable support among sociolinguists as well (e.g., Fasold and Wolfram 1970, pp. 63-64; Fasold 1971; Fasold 1981, pp. 170-71; Labov 1970b, p. 230).' William Labov infers from relatively high proportion of zero forms, lack of stylistic variation, and inefficacy of phonological constraints, that there is no underlying third singular -s in NNE [Nonstandard Negro English] (Labov, Cohen, Robins, and Lewis 1968, 1: 164). Within this theoretical framework, existing -s suffixes in black English have been interpreted, if in third person singular, as post-creole interference from standard English, or, if in any other grammatical person, as hypercorrect usage,2 as is explained by Burling (1973, p. 49):""]",1,0

"['This study explores how sexual orgasm is conceptualized in 27 languages and proposes an ideal cognitive model for sexual desire. Specifically, the study has identified that the conceptual metaphors, conceptual metonymies, and related concepts manifested in the terms and announcements for orgasm can be categorized into orgasm as a physiological response, orgasm as a psychological state, and orgasm as an ideal goal. We also observed that languages tend to conceptualize orgasm as a physiological response in the terms for orgasm; whereas more languages are inclined to conceptualize orgasm as an ideal goal in the announcements for orgasm. Depending on whether the focus is on the physiological, psychological, and ideal aspects during sex, native speakers of their various languages may conceptualize orgasm with the conceptual metaphors ORGASM IS A PEAK, ORGASM IS FIRE, ORGASM IS DEATH, ORGASM IS A DESTINATION, and ORGASM IS THE RELEASE OF FORCE/SUBSTANCE IN A CONTAINER; conceptual metonymies (i.e., EXCIT...']",1,0
"['• Auditory morphological processing is assessed in Spanish natives and anglophone L2 learners of Spanish. • Beginner L2 learners only decompose morphologically complex words with low surface frequency. • Advanced L2 learners and Spanish native speakers process words as wholes regardless of their surface frequency. • Working memory is not associated with decomposition in L2 learners or natives. Surface frequency and proficiency modulate visual morphological processing in second language (L2) learners, but less is known about auditory morphological processing. Moreover, working memory (WM) affects morphosyntactic processing, but it is unclear whether it also modulates word structure processing. In the present study, Spanish monolinguals and beginner and advanced L2 learners of Spanish completed an auditory lexical decision task in Spanish containing verbs varying in morphological complexity, an individual lexical frequency task, and a working memory task. Beginner L2 learners needed more time to process infrequent morphologically complex words, but monolinguals and advanced L2 learners were unaffected by morphological complexity or surface frequency. Also, WM did not modulate morphological processing. Taken together, the findings suggest a dual-route mechanism at initial stages of L2 acquisition and a whole-word route for Spanish monolinguals and advanced L2 learners. The findings also support the extension of dual-route models to L2 populations and suggest that the selection of a morphological processing route results from linguistic rather than cognitive reasons.']",1,0

Destacamos la fractura linguisticoideologica que significo la llegada de Lenz al contexto cultural chileno de fines del siglo XIX, dominado por el pensamiento normativista e hispanista inspirado en Andres Bello. La condicion polemica de las ideas de Lenz respecto de la ideologia dominante explica en buena medida que su recuperacion y revalorizacion, de la cual participan varios de los articulos de este volumen, sea relativamente reciente.

We describe his role as that of a glottopolitical vector, i.e. a key figure in the circulation and transformation of knowledge and ideological representations of the languages of Chile and their speakers. We highlight that his arrival to Chile caused a languageideological fracture, as he confronted the hegemony of linguistic normativism and hispanism, established on the basis of the influential works by Andres Bello. His polemical stance towards the dominant ideology explains that the recovering and revaluation of his work is a relatively recent phenomenon, as some of the articles of this special issue show. On the other hand, we warn about the risk of raising hagiographic readings of Lenz without considering the complexity of his context and the role of his works in the scientific, cultural and linguistic policies of his time.']",1,0

"['Hittite grammar has been of great interest to comparative linguistics ever since it was deciphered by Bedřich Hrozný in 1915 and published in 1917 as Die Sprache der Hethiter (SH). Here we find the first description of the Hittite nominal system. In this article, I focus on the spatial cases as described by Hrozný and as they are understood today. In Part 1, I present the background of Hrozný’s research. In part 2, spatial cases and their internal structure are outlined. In Part 3, I discuss the Hittite spatial cases as described in SH and as understood by contemporary researchers, with a focus on the basis for possible misunderstandings. Part 4 provides an overview of later research regarding the nominal system, and especially the spatial cases. The conclusion summarizes the comparison of Die Sprache der Hethiter and contemporary research.']",1,0

"[""RUSSIAN ONOMASTICS is a field in which there is much opportunity for scholarly research. Given names, in particular, still need much investigation. Only about a dozen scholars in Russia and the Soviet Union have concerned themselves with the problem of personal names, and even less research has been done abroad. In recent years, some research has been done in the Soviet Union mainly on what the Soviet researchers call new This term is generally meant to include those names which became popular in Russia only after the Revolution of 1917 and which are not found in the Russian Orthodox Church Calendar of Saints. Only one book has been written entirely on the subject of Soviet names. This one, Novye imena1 (New Names), by D. Delert, published in Rostov in 1924, is out of print today and not available even in Moscow's Lenin Library. Among the other Soviet scholars who have dealt with the problem of names, A. V. Superanskaja and L. V. Uspenskij are the best known. Both have written articles and books on various aspects of Russian onomastics, and each has at least one chapter concerned with Soviet names. One other Soviet work contains a chapter on the new This is Russkie imena (Russian Names) by A. A. Ugrjumov, published in Vologda in 1962. This book, however, was written on a popular rather than a scholarly level, and it contains errors resulting from the strong influence of Soviet attitudes upon the author. In addition, some Soviet names appear in various dictionaries, ineluding the Russian-Ukrainian dictionary of names published by S. F. Levcenko in 1961, and the Russian-White Russian dictionary of names published by M. R. Sudnik in 1965.""]",1,0

"[""Case or agr. Just as abstract Case and agr are cover terms for syntactic features with often idiosyncratic morphological realization, thematic roles seem most useful simply as syntactic designations for positions that enter into argument and adjunct relations. This is a good book, not just for its critique of theta theory, but also for the positive contribution of further development of the Decompositional Theory. Although the book is a revised dissertation, it doesn't read like one: the style is engaging and philosophical, and the exemplification is detailed and clear. And while it does not cover every thematic-role-based proposal ever made, the book is nevertheless to be recommended to anyone who has puzzled over the content of thematic roles. [Edwin Battistella, University of Alabama in Birmingham] Psychology of language: An introduction to sentence and discourse processes. By Murray Singer. Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum, 1990. Pages xi, 308. $24.95. Recent years have seen the emergence of an essentially interdisciplinary, cognitive-science approach to natural language processing, with some of the most fruitful work focusing on discourse structure and processing. Singer's book is intended as an introductory graduate textbook, though it is also suitable as a desk reference for the linguist, cognitive psychologist, or computer scientist with an interest in natural language processing. An introductory graduate textbook must accomplish several purposes: (i) familiarize students with key theoretical concepts; (ii) refer them to the fundamental literature in which those concepts are discussed; (iii) provide them with exemplars that teach them how to apply the concepts insightfully to the data; and (iv) inculcate a sense of relevance that enables students to read professional articles and evaluate their theoretical significance. S's book is probably above average by these standards. Key concepts are clearly if succinctly explained, fundamental articles are cited in each of the relevant disciplines, and examples are frequent and detailed enough to satisfy the most exacting linguist. The book's weaknesses are those endemic to any introductory text: it emphasizes consensus, spending more time summarizing established results than exploring open issues and controversies, and the passages which explain key concepts are often terse, so that the instructor may sometimes wish to assign source articles as background reading. Overall, the book appears to be a valuable introductory textbook for a course in psycholinguistics or discourse processing. It is divided into ten chapters, as follows: Ch. 1, 'Introduction'; Ch. 2, 'Language and meaning: Representing and remembering discourse'; Ch. 3, 'Syntax and parsing processes'; Ch. 4, The role of knowledge in language comprehension'; Ch. 5, 'Understanding coherent discourse'; Ch. 6, Theme'; Ch. 7, 'Inference processes'; Ch. 8, 'Understanding stories'; Ch. 9, 'Question answering and sentence verification'; and Ch. 10, 'Natural language understanding by computers—and people'. One of the noteworthy aspects of the book is its thorough integration of psycholinguistic data with the concepts of discourse analysis, including coherence, the givennew contract, thematic structure, and scripts. [Paul Deane, University of Central Florida.] An essay on grammar-parser relations. By Jan van de Koot. Dordrecht: Foris, 1990. Pp. xii, 152. Paper $24.50. In this monograph, K investigates the possible relations between grammars and parsers. Any theory of the mind that postulates separate 240 LANGUAGE, VOLUME 68, NUMBER 1 (1992) levels of representations raises the question of what relations are possible, justified and beneficial among the several levels. Two such theories are Marr's theory of vision and Chomskyan generative grammar, with their separation of competence from performance. The book under review belongs to the research line of computer modelling of performance started by Parsifal (Mitchell Marcus, A theory of syntactic recognition for natural language, Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1980) in the Government-Binding framework. The monograph starts with a critical introduction to the relevant issues. Through extensive quotations from Marr's work (David Marr, Vision, San Francisco, CA: Freeman, 1982) K presents the methodological justification for multileveled theories of cognition. He then proceeds to explore, in the more limited domain of the language faculty, the necessary features of a psychologically real theory of grammar. The arguments that led some scholars to consider transformational grammar not psychologically real are presented and rebutted by the introduction of a more articulated framework for evaluation, which takes into account the separateness of competence grammar, runtime grammar, parsing technique, and evaluation metrics. Although nothing new is added to the debate here, the main issues of a discussion that spans a decade are reviewed clearly and concisely. Ch. 2 is an overview of several proposals in the framework of deterministic parsing. Most notably, the first such parser, Parsifal, is presented in detail. Arguing against some recent criticism of Parsifal's use of look-ahead, K claims that the use of look-ahead to resolve local ambiguities is empirically correct if coupled with the assumption that lexical-semantic information can be used during syntactic processing, when it is needed for disambiguation. K also reviews the formal properties of Parsifal, drawing on other works in the literature to argue that determinism provides a functional explanation of WH-islands at most, and that it is neutral with respect to grammatical formalism. Ch. 3 explores the relation between the Barriers theory (Noam Chomsky, Barriers. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1986) and deterministic parsing. The parsing platform is Parsifal, with alterations and augmentations that link it more tightly to the grammar and make it more accurate empirically. An algorithm for chain formation is proposed here. K discusses its integration in the existing parser and its application to some linguistic facts, such as violations of the Subject and Adjunct Conditions and parasitic gaps. Some interesting ideas are put forth in this chapter, although more extensive exemplification and, if not a real implementation, at least lower-level specifications of the algorithms would have substantiated the proposal more convincingly. The book ends with a number of theoretical investigations of the possible contribution of the theory of performance to the theory of competence. In general, the reader interested in these issues will find in K's book an accurate and critical review of the main issues in the tradition of deterministic parsing, in itself a needed and useful contribution. Because the book is not intended as a review, however, more space should have been devoted to the author's new proposal; interesting ideas, such as those related to the algorithms for chain formation, are not given enough space and detailed description. The book would have also benefited from more careful editing and typesetting. [Paola Merlo. University ofMaryland.] Politically speaking: The pragmatic analysis of political language. By John Wilson. (Language in Society series.) Basil Blackwell, 1990. Pp. 203. Cloth $45.95, paper $16.95. Politically speaking offers an interesting and frequently amusing look at political speech from the perspective of linguistic pragmatics. Unlike Robin Lakoffs Talking power (New York: Basic Books, 1990), it does not investigate political power or even politics in a generic sense; and, unlike Frederick Bowers's Linguistic aspects oflegislative expression (Vancouver: University of British Columbia Press, 1990). it does not examine statutory language. Rather, Wilson explores politicians' utterances in speeches and interviews. Examples from other cultures are used, but mostly the study deals with recent British and American political figures.

"[""Abstract This paper (based on a presentation delivered at the 2012 PALA conference in Malta) aims to explain and illustrate the main principles of Contextual Prosodic Theory (CPT), developed by Bill Louw, the originator of the notion of semantic prosody (McEnery and Hardy, 2012: 135). No less importantly, it aims to free the theory from unwarranted criticism it has attracted over the past few years. I deal with the theoretical objections to Louw's stylistics in McEnery and Hardy (2012) and in Hunston (2007). In doing so, certain basic assumptions of Louw's stylistics are restated, such as the roles of intuition, authorial intention and the individual reader's perception. Is Louw justified in assuming that a text may be interpreted by what is, prima facie, NOT in it? After showing how reference corpora can reasonably be taken to influence the act of reading, I give an illustration of a new development in CPT: logical semantic prosody – subtext (Louw 2010a, 2010b). The reference corpora I use include the BNC and COCA, available on Mark Davies' site, and Tim Johns' corpus of the 1995 edition of the Times newspaper, containing 44.5 million words.""]",1,0

The journal was still an off-set produced publication sent out free of charge by the University of South Carolina as a public service.

Despite a few studies on the “CCTV CUP” in the literature, none of them has focused on the contestants’ perspective.

Then it takes 7 final contestants’ “reactions to participating in the contest” for analysis, focusing on what impacts participating in this contest brought on them. The results show that participating in the “CCTV CUP” English public speaking contest not only deepened the contestants’ understandings about English public speaking, but brought significant harvests at ability training, and the increase of life experience and wisdom.

"['Mandatives:Lessons on raising/control diagnostics Michael Barrie and Christine Pittman 1. Introduction At first blush, mandative infinitival constructions (1) in English (Quirk and Greenbaum 1973) take on the appearance of control constructions based on traditional raising/control diagnostics. (1) a. Mary ordered John to peel the grapes. b. John commanded Mary to wash the star fruit. c. Mary obliged John to slice the papaya. d. Mary permitted John to core the apple. There are a number of important differences between mandatives and control predicates. First, unlike most control predicates, mandatives do not allow a partial control reading (Wurmbrand 2001:241, 247). (2) a. John ordered Mary to go to the opera (*together). b. Susan obliged Fred to *meet/*gather/wait in the lobby. This is surprising since mandatives do not fit neatly in Landau\'s (2000) class of control verbs that do not allow partial control, namely modals, aspectuals, and implicatives, which take so-called tenseless infinitives. We employ a variety of traditional diagnostics (mostly derived from Perlmutter and Soames 1978) to show that the mandatives instead pattern with raising-to-object verbs. Crucially for the analysis we lay out, the subject of the embedded clause is not θ-marked by the matrix verb. However, we argue that these predicates have an additional requirement. This usually leads to the interpretation of an implicit (pragmatically determined) goal of mandation (i.e., an orderee). This goal of mandation is often equivalent to the embedded subject (thus the appearance of control) but is not necessarily the embedded subject, as we illustrate below. [End Page 131] The remainder of the squib is organized as follows. Section 2 argues that mandatives such as order, command, and oblige are raising-to-object predicates. Section 3 presents a suggestion for the argument structure of mandatives. Section 4 is a brief conclusion. 2. Mandatives Are Raising-To-Object Verbs This section examines the standard diagnostics for raising versus control showing that they give mixed results for mandatives. We argue that the requirement that mandatives have an implicit goal of mandation interferes with some of the standard tests. Once these interfering factors are controlled for, the diagnostics clearly show these predicates to be raising verbs. 2.1 Non-thematic subjects Mandatives are usually thought to pattern with control verbs and not with raising-to-object verbs in terms of their ability to occur with non-thematic subjects. The following examples show that weather-it is not permitted in control constructions, but is permitted in raising constructions, respectively. (3)*John persuaded it to snow. (4) John expected it to snow. On the surface, mandatives seem to pattern with control (3) and not with raising-to-object (4). (5)*John ordered/commanded/required/permitted it to snow. However, non-thematic there shows a different pattern. Again, expletives are not permitted with control constructions but are available in raising constructions. (6)*John persuaded there to be fruit available at the reception. (7) John expected there to be fruit available at the reception. (8) John ordered/required/commanded/permitted there to be fruit available at the reception. Example (8) shows that the expletive there is available to mandatives. The following examples were found on various websites using Google.1 Similar data can easily be found with other mandative verbs. (9) There is no known evidence however that Arnold Palmer (the ""King"") ordered there to be any harm done to him.

Quel est l’impact de la pédagogie par le projet sur le climat émotionnel dans lequel se déroule l’apprentissage linguistique ?L’objet de cet article est de présenter les résultats d’une enquête menée auprès d’une centaine d’étudiants suivant les cours de langues à l’Institut des langues vivantes de l’Université catholique de Louvain (UCL), à Louvain-la-Neuve (Belgique). La recherche a permis de mesurer les émotions (émotions positives et négatives, ainsi que le stress) et les caractéristiques sociales des étudiants (estime de soi et support social) avant et après leur implication dans la création d’évènements « hors classe » en langue cible et intégrés dans le cursus scolaire. Les résultats montrent que la pédagogie par le projet a un impact émotionnel positif si le produit final de l’activité est clairement visualisé par les étudiants et si le projet proposé est en adéquation avec la filière professionnelle de ceux-ci.']",1,0

In Study 1, three monolingual children were recorded every two weeks for seven months, beginning when the children were about 1; 7. In Study 2, four monolingual children about 3; 10 were recorded once or twice. Two analyses were done. Instrumental analysis of the stop productions revealed that not even by age 3; 10 were the children consistently distinguishing between voiced–voiceless stop cognate pairs on the basis of adult-like voice-onset time characteristics.

"['Abstract This article takes a bird’s eye view of how positive or negative sentiments in the news press about countries and nationality nouns seem to reflect the country’s general income groups. The study focuses on the four income groups classified by the World Bank and their co-occurrence with positively and negatively classified adjectives from the Subjectivity Lexicon for Czech. A search in the journalistic subcorpus of the SYN series, release 8 of the Czech National Corpus, results in a time line covering three decades. Previous research on subjectivity has either focused on other parts of the Subjectivity Lexicon or on fewer adjectives from other languages. In this article, it is argued that the income groups are treated in descending order, i.e., the higher the income, the more positive the sentiment. Even when the most influential groups in the top and bottom are removed, the result holds. Discourse concerning global war and peace, and the security of different nations, is also detected as a result.']",1,0

"[""Abstract This article presents an analysis of some restrictions on verb-initial word orders in Basque. Following Rivero's (1993a) analysis of similar facts in Breton, I will claim that the morphological feature for tense in these languages must occur in a configuration with a licenser in the appropriate structural position. Languages may differ as to licensing domain requirements, and I will claim that while Breton uses an internal domain, tense licensing in Basque takes place in the canonical head checking-domain. Where the relevant licenser is not available in that domain, last resort operations will apply to provide the correct licensing configuration. In particular, long-head movement in Breton creates the appropriate internal domain for tense, while ba-insertion produces the correct checking configuration for Basque. The article is organized as follows. The introductory section provides the relevant background information on word-order and verb first and verb second patterns in Basque. Section 2 deals with some restrictions on verb first structures in Basque, while section 3 introduces similar facts from Breton, pointing out both the similarities and differences between the two languages. Section 4 shows that the verb-initial patterns under consideration in Basque contain a tensed verbal form in C, and section 5 draws the analysis of the data. I claim that the morphological feature for tense must be licensed in the overt syntax in Basque, much like other morphological features. Such licensing is carried out in the canonical configurations for head checking as defined in Chomsky (1992). The article closes with a look at ‘tenseless’ finite constructions like imperatives, where, as expected, the restrictions on initial verbs do not hold.""]",1,0

['提要： 会话分析（Conversation Analysis）的研究对象是人们的交际活动，包括日常的会话和机构性交谈。课堂教学是机构性交谈的一种，因此从会话分析创立之初，就有研究者按照会话分析的理论和方法来对课堂交流进行研究。本文从课堂交互研究和课堂学习研究两个方面概述了会话分析路向的课堂教学研究，包括主要的课题及其成果。在课堂交互活动研究方面，研究者从话轮转换、序列结构、会话补救三个方面深入挖掘课堂交互活动的特点。早期的一些研究较多关注于教师主导的课堂活动，描述教师在话轮分配上的主导地位；新近的研究开始关注其他类型的课堂活动或教师主导的课堂中其他类型的活动中的话轮替换形式。在课堂教学活动序列结构方面，会话分析路向的课堂研究显示了它微观分析的优势，细致而深入地描述 IRE 在课堂教学中的具体实现过程，准确地描写了后续话轮的作用。纠正学生的错误是课堂教学中的重要一环，会话分析路向的课堂研究表明，把课堂教学中的补救或纠错与日常会话的补救做简单的对比是不恰当的。课堂的补救行为跟 IRE 序列有密切的关联，并且研究还发现课堂上的补救行为与课堂教学环境有很大关联，跟课堂教学中不同阶段的特定教学目标密切相关。此外，会话分析路向的习得研究在很多方面丰富和补充了已有的第二语言习得研究。它最大的优势在于利用真实的语料来揭示学习者的理解和学习是否、何时、怎样、为什么产生。同时由于会话分析导向的习得研究把学习看作是一种社会交流活动，突破了大多数 SLA 研究把学习当作是个体认知活动的局限。我们认为，会话分析注重真实语料以及交互者视角的特点给汉语作为第二语言的课堂研究提供了有益的借鉴。'],1,0

A model of errors is described, including similar errors and errors that are repeated both intratextually and intertextually. The error frequency in A Dictionary of Economic, Financial and Commercial Terms is higher than the average error frequency in a reference corpus of fourteen dictionaries (mainly first editions). This indicates that repeated editions do not always guarantee a higher level of formal correctness. Our results also show that a high frequency of errors does not necessarily entail a high intratextual error repetition rate. On the other hand, we establish a relationship between typographical errors and the access function in dictionaries, as that kind of error can interfere with access to accurate lexicographical information and data retrieval (especially when they occur in lemmas or sublemmas).']",1,0

The Linguistics of Sign Languages is intended primarily for students of linguistics or those with some background in the field. In that respect it is unique. Introductory linguistics textbooks often include only brief to sign languages (and sometimes with a focus on research on apes). Textbooks designed for students of specific sign languages, on the other hand, concentrate mainly on a single sign language, such as ASL. Thus this book differs from existing linguistics textbooks on sign languages, which are designed chiefly for students in the field.The Linguistics of Sign Languages focuses on typology: similarities and differences among sign languages and between signed and spoken language. Each chapter is written by one or more of the authors, together with other sign language researchers in the Netherlands. Each chapter is followed by a summary, a test yourself  section (e.g., in chapter 1, What is the difference between a gesture and a sign?), an assignments section (e.g., in chapter 4, Construct some short conversations in a sign language that you know that violate the maxims of quantity, quality, and relevance. Present these conversations to others, if possible, in your group and have them work out which maxims are violated.), and a references and further reading section, which summarizes research related to the chapter topic. There is also an associated website (https://benjamins.com/sites/z.199), which provides brief answers to the assignments, video clips of signed examples, a list of Web resources, and a number of references. The test yourself  and assignments sections will be useful to those who are teaching from this book. The website is a welcome innovation, but it contains some infelicities, which I address later.The book comprises fourteen chapters, which are arranged in a somewhat unusual order for an introductory text: Topics such as acquisition and psycholinguistic processing precede any detailed description of sign language structure. Chapter 1, Sign Languages as Natural Languages, introduces sign language, sign languages, and their communities of users. Chapter 2, Psycholinguistics, includes a brief discussion of sign language and the brain and reviews the research studies on sign language production and comprehension. Chapter 3 discusses sign language acquisition in children, and chapter 4 deals with interaction and discourse. The next seven chapters cover the major linguistic areas: Chapter 5, constituents and word classes; chapter 6 and chapter 7, the syntax of simple sentences and complex sentences, respectively; chapter 8, the lexicon (including iconicity and lexicography); chapter 9, morphology; chapter 10, phonetics; and chapter 11, phonology. The final three chapters deal with sign language in its contexts of use. Chapter 12 discusses language variation and standardization, including both linguistic variation and policy issues; and chapter 13 delves into language contact and change. …']",1,0

"['Abstract This paper investigates the realization of subjects in Broad and Narrow Focus constructions, from both an acquisitional and a theoretical perspective. Specifically, NF structures include Information (IF) and Corrective (CF) subjects and the study concerns Italian children (4–9 y.o.). Data are collected through an original experiment, based on spontaneous answers to (recorded) questions associated to scene settings. It is shown that the SV strategy is the most frequently used, independent of either Focus or verb type (considering transitive, unaccusative and unergartive verbs). Importantly, however, prosodic analysis shows that the SV order is systematically associated to distinct contours according to Focus types. As for the VS order, it appears as a late acquisition (around 7 y.o.) for both NF and BF constructions and is always associated with a downgrading contour. In a cartographic approach, these results lead to the conclusion that focus-related discourse and p-features are merged in dedicated projections and trigger movement to be valued and interpreted at Spell-Out. Consequently, p-features are uninterpretable at PF in the VS order. Finally, since the realization of postverbal subjects is part of the Null Subject Parameter, VS late emergence supports the hypothesis that the discourse-related competences connected with its acquisition are managed after 7 y.o.']",1,0

"[""Number and Events:Verbal Reduplication in Niuean Mohammad Haji-Abdolhosseini, Diane Massam, and Kenji Oda Abstract In this paper we examine Niuean verbal reduplication, and, building on Sperlich (1997a,b, 2001), we show that there are several morphophonological types of reduplication (monomoraic prefixation, bimoraic suffixation, bimoraic prefixation), and there are several different meanings for reduplicated verbs (singularization, intensity, iterativity) that all lie within the semantic domain of pluractionality. We show that, in general, each different phonological type of reduplication corresponds to a particular meaning. It is difficult to predict, however, what a reduplicated verb will mean from its form alone, in part because most words in the language are bimoraic, and there is no difference in form between bimoraic suffixation and prefixation for such words. Once we add in the lexical aspectual semantics of the base verbs, however, we find that it is to a large extent predictable what the meaning will be for a given reduplicated verb, depending on its aspectual class. As well as examining verbal reduplication in general, we focus on agreement or accord reduplication in Niuean, and argue that it is, in fact, not an independent syntactically governed type of reduplication, but instead it is a subtype of the reduplication associated with iterative semantics. The accord effect comes into play if an affecting or a stative verb is iterated, because if such a verb is iterated, the relevant argument must be plural for semantic reasons. 1. Introduction.1 This paper addresses the forms and functions of verbal reduplication in Niuean, an Oceanic language of the Tongic subgroup, spoken mainly in Niue and New Zealand. As in other Oceanic languages, the reduplication system in Niuean is a rich and interesting one (Ioane 1999; Krupa 1982; McEwen 1970; Seiter 1980; Sperlich 1997a,b, 2001), in which verbs, nouns and modifiers can be reduplicated to yield a variety of derived meanings. But this paper will concentrate on verbal reduplication, and will take as a starting point the phenomenon referred to as agreement by Seiter (1980) and as syntactically governed reduplication by Sperlich (1997) and Ioane (1999). Our exploration of the types of verbs that undergo this agreement process will reveal that it is not an agreement phenomenon, nor a syntactic [End Page 475] phenomenon distinct from the other semantically based functions of reduplication, but that it instead falls in quite naturally with the other uses of reduplication, once we consider the lexical aspectual class of the reduplicating verb within the semantics of pluractionality (Lasersohn 1995; Newman 1980, 1990). As well as bringing this class of reduplication in line with others, our paper will examine several other aspects of the morphophonology and semantics of Niuean verbal reduplication. 2. Reduplicative Accord. Seiter (1980) notes that some verbs in Niuean reduplicate to agree with a plural absolutive subject of an intransitive verb, as in (1). With a few verbs, plural agreement is indicated by suppletion rather than by reduplication (2). Certain transitive verbs indicate agreement with an absolutive object (3). Other verbs do not exhibit agreement at all (4).2 (1) a. Ne hoko mai a Sione. PAST arrive there ABS Sione 'Sione arrived/came there.' b. Ne hohoko mai a laua. PAST arrive.PL there ABS they 'They arrived/came there.' (2) a. To fano a au ... FUT go ABS I 'I will go ...' b. To ō a tautolu ... FUT go.PL ABS we (INCL) 'We will go ...' (3) a. Kua hala e ia e lā akau. PERF cut ERG he ABS branch tree 'He cut the branch.' b. Kua hahala e ia e tau lā akau. PERF cut.PL ERG he ABS PL branch tree 'He cut the branches.' (4) a. Kua tomo e vaka. PERF sank ABS canoe 'The canoe sank.' b. Kua tomo e tau vaka. PERF sank ABS PL canoe 'The canoes sank.' [End Page 476] Seiter refers to this reduplication as agreement, but it has a number of unusual properties in comparison with standard verb-argument agreement. For example, not all verbs agree with a plural argument, and agreement is just for number, and not for person. In addition, agreement is not triggered by a consistent surface grammatical function. This last point is illustrated in (5), from...""]",1,0

"['Abstract This paper has two purposes. Firstly, it provides a bird’s eye view of the characteristics of a variety of Gujarati in diaspora, viz. that spoken in Cape Town, South Africa for almost 150 years. Secondly it focusses on one notable feature, viz. the prominence of retroflexes over dentals, and connects this with other dialects of Gujarati in India and with Western Indo-Aryan. We analyse the speech of 32 speakers born or brought up in South Africa, and resident in Cape Town. We show that Cape Town Gujarati retains the dialect variation of late nineteenth century Gujarati as identified by Grierson, Sir George A. 1908. Linguistic survey of India. Vol IX, part II: Indo-Aryan family, Central Group – Rajasthani and Gujarati . Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass. In particular, it resembles the Surti dialect, in keeping with the fact that the area around Surat district provided the bulk of migrants to Cape Town in the nineteenth and twentieth century. We then focus in detail on a prominent, but little-studied, phenomenon of Gujarati dialects: the variable occurrence of retroflex stops where Standard Gujarati has dentals [t̪ t̪ h d̪ d̪ h ]. We demonstrate the considerable amount of such “retroflex boosting” in the Cape Town variety. We provide a detailed and replicable methodology from variationist sociolinguistics for studying this boosting that we believe illuminates the study of its occurrence in modern dialects in Gujarat.']",1,0

"['Abstract “Pragmatics involves perception augmented by some species of ‘ampliative‘ inference—induction, inference to the best explanation, Bayesian reasoning, or perhaps some special application of general principles special to communication, as conceived by Grice … —but in any case a sort of reasoning” (Korta, Kepa &amp; John Perry. 2015. Pragmatics. In The stanford encyclopedia of philosophy Edward N. Zalta (ed.), Metaphysics research lab , Stanford, CA: Stanford University:1). Pragmatics assumes that one’s competence as speaker is sufficient to allow one to construct, in range of significant cases, plausible accounts of how speakers and audiences reason. The question is that are those who attribute reasoning to speakers and audiences suffering a “curious mental derangement” that prevents them from seeing that reasoning is rare? I consider four responses. (1) Speakers and audiences do reason to the extent pragmatic explanations require; they just typically do not do so consciously. (2) The second reply concedes that speakers and audiences often do not reason even unconsciously in any relevant detail, but it insists that attributions of reasoning can nonetheless be, and often are, explanatory. (3) The third reply is a response to objections to the second. It identifies reasoning with information processing steps. (4) The fourth view is that a speaker’s utterance provides an audience evidence for what the speaker means, but the audience typically does not reason to a conclusion about what the speaker means. I reject the first three replies and embrace the fourth, but I argue that attributions of reasoning in pragmatics can still play a significant explanatory role.']",1,0

O estudo apresentado neste artigo aborda essa tarefa no corpus DIHANA, cujo esquema de anotação de actos de diálogo em três níveis coloca problemas que não foram explorados em estudos recentes. Além do problema hierárquico, os dois níveis inferiores colocam problemas de classificação multi-etiqueta. Além disso, cada nível da hierarquia refere-se a um aspecto diferente relativo à intenção do orador, tanto em termos da estrutura do diálogo, como da tarefa. Por outro lado, uma vez que os diálogos são em espanhol, este corpus permite-nos avaliar se as melhores abordagens para dados em inglês generalizam para uma língua diferente. Mais especificamente, comparamos o desempenho de diferentes abordagens de representação de segmentos, com foco tanto em sequências como em padrões de palavras, e avaliamos a importância do histórico do diálogo e das relações entre os múltiplos níveis da hierarquia. No que diz respeito ao problema de classificação de etiqueta única colocado pelo nível superior, mostramos que as conclusões obtidas a partir de dados em inglês se mantêm em dados em espanhol. Para além disso, mostramos que as abordagens podem ser adaptadas para cenários multi-etiqueta.

"['In this article I discuss pro and its licensing strategies. I argue that the D-feature postulated by Chomsky (1995) for Tense and v can be realized in a separate head, namely, on a D, which then licenses pro (along the lines of Torrego (1998)). Focusing on nominative subjects in certain infinitival clauses of Catalan, Italian, and Spanish, I propose that their nominative subjects are licensed by a D with “weak” agreement features in association with Tense. Expletive pro and argumental pro are discussed and it is proposed that the D that licenses the former has no agreement features, whereas the D that licenses the latter has “rich” agreement. A parallel is established between the licensing strategy of “clitic-doubling” and the licensing of argumental pro in infinitival clauses.']",1,0

The paper contains an overview of studies carried out by leading experts in foreign language learning/ teaching, confirming the fact that creativity and collaboration are significant aspects of the learning process. Theoretical considerations are supported by the analysis of a case study: an online collaboration project between the University of Angers Institute of Technology (France) and Kaunas University of Technology (KTU) (Lithuania), which took place in 2011. Six bi-national students teams were asked to design a product or service that would meet the needs of other first-year university students. The participants worked together on the Moodle virtual learning platform to evaluate target needs, brainstorm for possible solutions, negotiate a common plan, create attractive and convincing promotional materials, and present their work to peers for approval by videoconference. The paper includes the description of the process and the products/ services created by the international students’ teams, and their comments that prove the positive added value of the project which can help to implement principles of cultural interaction and creative thinking more effectively. The project experience has shown that there is room for improvement, therefore the authors discuss the possibilities of facilitating the students’ interaction and involvement.

Five years later, the children were 6 to 9 years of age. Data on their school-age abilities were collected through surveys of parents and teachers. Parents indicated that 17.4% of the children were receiving classroom accommodations or special education programs and 54.5% had one or more diagnoses. The most common diagnosis was attention deficit disorder/attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADD/ADHD), occurring in 25% of the children, primarily boys. Learning disability and speech language impairment were each noted in 11.4% of the children. Language and Social Skill profiles on the Children's Communication Checklist-2 and Social Skills Rating Scale (SSRS) indicated that structural and meaning-based language abilities were areas of strength. Measures of pragmatic use of language (i.e., Use of Context, Social Relations, Nonverbal Communication) were relative weaknesses. Behavior profiles on the SSRS indicated higher than average levels of hyperactivity. The profile of Language and Social Skills strengths and weaknesses was similar to patterns observed in children with ADD/ADHD. Age of adoption was not predictive of school-age outcomes on these measures, but the children's expressive vocabulary when they were 2 to 3 years of age predicted SSRS outcomes for Social Skills and Problem Behaviors.""]",1,0

"['Abstract Contextualized in the “Going Global” strategy of Chinese corporations under the Belt and Road Initiative and drawing upon the attitudinal and engagement systems of appraisal, this study aims to provide semiotic and rhetorical insights into the discursive strategies of Chinese corporations in microblogging on overseas social networking sites (SNS). The posts, made over a 15-day period by the five giant Chinese companies on the US-based SNS Facebook, are analyzed both quantitatively and qualitatively. The results reveal that, in terms of attitudinal appeals, judgment resources are most preferred by Chinese corporations while affect resources are least deployed; in terms of engagement patterns, dialogic engagement patterns proliferate. It is explained that Chinese corporations strongly appeal to ethos and low power distance, demonstrating Western achievement-based cultural orientations, despite the existing discursive manifestations of the high-context, power-distanced, collectivistic characteristics of Chinese culture. This pragmatic and rhetorical shift elicits transculturality in a global cyber space informed by digital globalization and economic glocalization.']",1,0

His opponents argued that this was an attack on private enterprise (with “that” referring to business), while his supporters and fact-checking organizations maintained that “that” referred to what Obama was talking about previously (U.S. infrastructure) and represented his political-economic plan of an increased interlacing of private business with government investment. I argue, from a relevance-theoretic perspective, that both interpretations follow from differing contextual assumptions on the part of the audience. In this sense, the role of contextual assumptions in utterance interpretation is highlighted – different contextual assumptions lead to different cognitive effects if the utterance leaves room for more than one interpretation. Combined with a highly polarized U.S. political arena, where participants pounce on their opponent’s every possible miscue, all the ingredients for misunderstanding are present.']",1,0

I propose an extension of these to account for OV order in infinitival clauses as well. In addition, the Old French data show that the concomitantly occurring instances of VO in this language must be due to the presence of grammars in competition, where an older OV grammar is being replaced by a newer VO one.']",1,0

"[""This paper investigates the concept of trust at the discourse level. Based on an epistemological discourse approach (Busse 1987), trust is defined as trust-relevant knowledge, which is usually implicit. The paper focuses on the methodology of the analysis of trust at discourse level in the mass media reporting on refugees by identifying implicit indicators of trust constructions (trust dimensions) and their discourse linguistic operationalization through argumentation patterns. The manual annotation of trust dimensions and a combination of hermeneutic and automatic analysis using Maxqda play a central role for the operationalization of the concept trust for discourse linguistic analysis. The implementation of the method is demonstrated by analyzing the media construction of the loss and the rebuilding of trust towards refugees (the discursive trust dynamics) in the context of the New Year's Eve sexual assaults in Germany in December 2015/January 2016. In contrast to sociological studies, the present analysis does not show an increased mass media construction of distrust in the face of this discursive event and therefore demonstrates that discourse linguistic trust research contributes to the interdisciplinary research on trust and provides valid findings about the collective knowledge about refugees.""]",1,0

"['It appears that in mixed quotations like the following, the quoted expression is used and mentioned at the same time: George says Tony is his ‘bestest friend’. Most theories seek to account for this observation by assuming that mixed quotations operate at two levels of content at once. In contradistinction to such two-dimensional theories, we propose that quotation involves just a single level of content. Quotation always produces a change in meaning of the quoted expression, and if the quotation is mixed the shift is, to a first approximation at least, from α to ‘what x calls ‘α’’, where x is a variable whose value is determined by the context. We argue that quotation is generally context dependent in various ways, and that some of these ways are presuppositional in nature; we present a detailed analysis of the presuppositions in question.']",1,0
"[""1. This article proposes a criticism and elaboration of the theory of Natural Morphology as it relates to inflection and to inflectional change. The theoretical framework I start from is that set out at length in Mayerthaler (1981/1988), Wurzel (1984/1989), Dressler (1987) and Kilani-Schoch (1988). The concept of naturalness involved here combines Prague School notions of markedness (see Andersen, 1989) with more recent typological approaches and a semiotic framework which derives from the work of C. S. Peirce. The goal of naturalness theories in historical linguistics is to identify some constraints on language change (for example, on sound change, analogy and grammaticalization) which are, broadly speaking, functionally motivated, that is, motivated by the nature of human psychology or of human communication. Naturalness theories offer an approach to explanation of Weinreich, Labov & Herzog's (1968; 102, 186) actuation problem . Among other things, Natural Morphology proposes explanatory principles and constraints for analogy .""]",1,0

"['Cognitive poetics is a part of cognitive science. Cognitive science is a scholarly paradigm of the second half of the 20th – first decades of 21st cent. Cognitive science shares all traits of scholarly paradigm: critics of predecessors, new understanding of investigation object and new conceptual apparatus, new tasks and effective methods of its solution, and its indraft, in the capacity of obligatory, into material of scholarly of fiction. It’s always written about discourse of fiction, that it is at the interface of literary criticism and linguistics. It is exactly literary texts that form the “figure” of modern cognitive poetics, whereas its “background” is religious, humorous texts and also mass-media products. Cognitive poetics devotes itself to the exploration of mental processes, accompanied by communication of reader and text. Notions of prototype and uniformity, conceptual metaphor and metaphorical blending are treated, resting on works of M. Freeman, G. Lakoff, K. Hautley, P. Stockwell. Special attention is payed to incompatibility of cognitive poetics, that proclaims deligitimation of fiction, with philological and structural-semiotic approaches, with ideas of aesthetic function of language and aesthetic value of verbal work of fiction, with concepts of mimesis and catharsis by Aristoteles. In the last part analysis by M. L. Gasparov of the verse by A. Fet (Чудная картина, Как ты мне родна: Белая равнина, Полная луна, свет небес высоких и блестящий снег И саней далеких Одинокий бег) and the verse by Percy Bysshe Shelley «Ozymandias» are discussed. M. L. Gasparov is far from cognitive poetics, but he builds his analysis, resting on the major human cognitive capacity – visual perception and tridimensional text space, reconstructed by him, which implicitly refers to cognitive deixis. Holistic perception is superposed with strong emotional experience and unselfish satisfaction. P. Stockwell, on the contrary, starts from the notion of cognitive deixis and describes its kinds, but, analyzing “Ozymandias”, he applies to well-known figures of different senders and receivers. The parallel is made between sculpture and poet and then – between destroyed statue and text as an archetype. The verse is also concentrated on the production process of creation and on the act of reading: traveler reads inscription and then reads it to narrator, which in its turn reads it to us in the form of verse. Finally Stockwell reaches that explanation of the impact on the reader, made by this verse. Thus, incompatible in theory turns to be pretty compatible in practice.']",1,0

They are common in Dutch and German (e.g., D. daarmee, G. damit, lit. ‘therewith’, ‘with that’, D. erna, G. danach, lit. ‘hereafter’, ‘after this’). This contribution concerns a quantitative study of variation in R-pronouns in modern Moroccan and Turkish ethnolectal Dutch. In conversational speech of bilingual speakers of Moroccan Dutch, Turkish Dutch and two groups of monolingual ‘white’ Dutch (one of them being the control group), R-pronouns appear to vary in three dimensions: the R-pronoun can or cannot be realized (with the latter option violating the norms of Dutch); if it is realized, the R-pronoun and the preposition can or cannot be split (both options conform the norms of Standard Dutch), if the R-pronoun is not realized, then either another pronoun is used instead or there is no substitute (both variants violate the norms of Dutch). For all three dimensions of variation, statistical analyses were carried out, starting from a total of 1160 realizations by 52 representatives of the four groups. The analyses involved three internal parameters and four social ones. The results serve to answer research questions concerning the origin of the variation, its place in the verbal repertoires and the social spread of the variation.']",1,0

Van die enkele studies op die terrein ondersoek weliswaar die reelmatige ‘ontdoening’ van vorige ‘doenings’-aksies, maar die studies konsentreer op taalkorpusbeplanning. Die skynbare verskraling van Afrikaans se posisie as hoeronderwystaal van Suid-Afrika laat die vraag ontstaan of ontdoeningsaksies met betrekking tot taalstatus- en taalfunksiebeplanning ook as taalontplanning beskou kan word. Omdat die onderhawige geval met ingrypende taalbeleidshersienings verbind kan word, ondersoek hierdie studie die verband tussen beleidshersiening – soms die agilleshiel van universiteite genoem – en taalontplanning. Die kollig val op die Universiteit van die Vrystaat (UV) se uitfasering van Afrikaans as hooftaal sedert 2015. Daar word in die aangebode studie gesteun op ’n analise van gedokumenteerde bewyse van taalbeleidshersiening aan die UV sedert die dringende noodsaak daaraan in 2008 deur twee nasionaal-gegenereerde eksterne verslae uitgewys is. Na aanleiding van voorskrifte omtrent beleidshersiening vervat in die UV se 2005-metabeleid en voorskrifte omtrent spesifiek taalbeleidswysigings vervat in die 2003- institusionele taalbeleid word uitstaande momente in taalbeleidshersiening aan hierdie instelling saaklik behandel. Die studie bevind dat beleidskontinuiteit ’n sleutelbegrip is om te kan onderskei tussen twee duidelike fases in taalbeleidshersiening aan die UV, ’n post-2008 tydperk waarin sodanige kontinuiteit nagestreef word, ofskoon relatief ingrypende wysigings desondanks deurgevoer word, teenoor die tydperk vanaf 2015 waarin taalbeleidskontinuiteit doelbewus verbreek word. Dit blyk dat die verskyning van ’n interne transformasieverslag teen die einde van 2014 ’n sleutelrol gespeel het om hierdie koerswysiging te bewerkstellig en daarmee die weg help voorberei het vir die georkestreerde stigmatisering van parallelmediumonderrig (en deur assosiasie daarmee ook Afrikaans). So kon ’n intellektuele klimaat geskep word om met ontdoeningsaksies op gang te kon kom waardeur die ontplanning van Afrikaans aan die UV taalbeleidsmatig geinstitusionaliseer kon word.']",1,0

A cursory examination supported Freedman's suggestion that Piepkorn's B4 was an exemplar of Prism C, not only because it contained the noted deviation after B ii 65 (col. i' 18'), but also since A 8008 is clearly from a decagonal, not an octagonal, clay prism. A closer study of the fragment revealed that col. i' 14' also deviates from Prisms B and D (ii 66), as well as from Prism C (iii 97), and that col. ii', which was not referred to by Piepkorn, corresponds to Prisms B/D iii 74-78 and Prism C iv 84-87.7 With regard to the textual alteration, gal-meg a-tu-ra a-na NINAKI URU ENu-ti-ia (I safely returned to Nineveh, the city of my lordship) was changed to [sal-mel a]-tu-ra ana KURagUr[I] ([I] returned [safely] to Assyria).8 Since Borger's Prism G contains a number of textual changes, I tentatively identified A 8003 as belonging to that edition of Assurbanipal's res 1.

"[""N this paper I shall attempt to discuss the need for an American phonetic dictionary; the general nature of the proposed dictionary; its value; and the ripeness of the times for such a work. A person who travels much in America does not have to be a scholar to realize that there are three large speech zones, or belts, each pretty definitely marked in differences of pronunciation. Most phoneticians designate these different sections as East, South, and West. According to Dr. Hans Kurath, in 1920 the approximate number of inhabitants in each belt was as follows: East, 712 million; South, 32 million; West, 65 million.' Dr. Kurath presents a most valuable discussion of the of the three sections. There are, of course, historical reasons for these sectional differences in pronunciation. Each section zealously and justly clings to its type of pronunciation. And why shouldn't it? Will several million people of the West drop their r's because several million people of the South drop theirs? Or will either the West or the South by some phonetic fiat or amendment burst forth in the use of the broad a of New England? Men, women, and budding juniors may be driven sheep-fashion to submit to the dicta of etiquette books. But they will not change their so willingly or easily. Speech is more natural than etiquette. Sectional speech is a concomitant of mother's milk. The studied manipulation of the salad fork and the graceful approach to gravy come as close preludes to shaving and debutantism. When purists preach pronunciation or pronunciation, they frighten only a few style-slaves who wish to do the correct thing; but not knowing what that is, they are forced to rely upon some one else. The great bulk of people go on expressing their emotions and thoughts in the consonants and vowels of their parents. What, after all, is pronunciation? The French people may feel under some obligation to test their language by a standard since they are saddled with an Academy. However, I am told that the decisions of the French Academy are sometimes flouted by French men of letters. The English tongue is pronounced differently in every English-speaking land-Australia, South Africa, Canada, America,""]",1,0

In the sentence repetition task in Italian WS subjects scored significantly lower than controls. In the sentence repetition task in unfamiliar (or scarcely familiar) foreign languages WS subjects performed significantly better than DS subjects but scored significantly lower than controls. The lower performances of WS subjects may be related to a dysfunction of the basal ganglia involved in syntactic processing, while the lower performances of DS subjects may be explained in terms of an impairment of the fronto-cerebellar structures involved in articulation and working memory.""]",1,0

"['Discussion Note Sanford B. Steever Steever replies: Author Schiff man states that, apart from the 125 lapses in copyediting, typesetting, and the like—whose incidence would surely trigger a recall in a more mundane consumer product, the remaining 125 criticisms maybe dismissed because they are not really problems at all but merely reflect a philosophical difference between author and reviewer. The difference S would urge us to accept, however, strikes me as less lofty than the term ‘philosophical’ suggests: The grammars that linguists tend to prefer, pedagogical or scholarly, are those based on clear, accurate, and reasoned descriptions of the language. It is the dearth of such qualities in RGST that places its utility in serious doubt. Readers may decide for themselves whether, for example, the book’s numerous errors of fact should be treated as copyediting gaffes or philosophical differences. Since RGST is not a biography, the author’s intentions, experiences, classroom anecdotes, etc., matter only as they directly in form the book; to the extent they do not, they constitute digressions irrelevant to its content. S’s most explicit statement of purpose (p. i, repeated on the dust jacket) notes that he wrote RGST to make it ‘accessible to students studying the modern spoken language as well as to linguists and other specialists [emphasis added]’. The book is actively marketed to linguists; it is not structured as an ordinary language text, and its references cite the scholarly not the pedagogical literature. For these reasons and others, no special explanation is required for writing a linguistically oriented review of RGST. The use of Tamil writing to represent ST is not objectionable in itself, only when it is used, as in RGST, to obscure the text and detract from such substantive issues as the accurate description of the language. Whether RGST’s examples can successfully function in spoken Tamil is not raised in the review; but since S asserts a radical difference between WT and ST (i), the use of written sources to supply examples of spoken Tamil undermines his claim that he is writing about the spoken variety. My review calls not for a linguistically informed survey of the grammatical literature on Tamil but merely for RGST to take seriously a dozen or so of the works cited in the body and listed in the references. It is not their methods and models which should concern the ordinary language student but their empirically superior descriptions. Both RGST and the author’s reply confuse grammatical terms with the linguistic realities they purport to describe; in doing so, S trivializes Paramasivam’s elegant analysis as a mere terminological alternative when in fact it provides a far more satisfactory description of paired verbs than S does. Despite S’s stated aversion to fancy linguistic terminology, he introduces such terms as ‘performative’ and ‘illocutionary force’ in the book. In sum, RGST’s use of ‘transitivity’ is as careless and unmotivated as its use of ‘illocutionary force’. S’s reply would skirt the critical process by suggesting that his 30 years of teaching experience validate RGST, whatever its shortcomings maybe. However, with so few substantive changes between the 1979 and the 1999 versions, as well as the problems common to both, the last 20 years seem not to have figured very prominently in that experience. The reply discusses various intentions, beliefs, and speculations apart from the text: One belief attributed to me is that S ‘either ignored this material, was unaware of it, failed to comprehend it, or failed in [his] responsibility to present the issue’. Such conclusions presuppose that he was paying attention to the issues; as the many lapses in the production values of the book attest, it is equally possible that he was not. Finally, S’s claim that mine is the most negative review he has ever read needs to be understood in this context: The review is not unrelated to the content of his book.

"['Using data drawn from twenty American plays written since 1889, this paper analyzes the usage of the weak obligation modals should and ought , which previous researchers (e.g. Coates, 1983; Leech, 1987; Palmer, 1987) have regarded as essentially synonymous. It is shown that there is a clear distinction between these words, with should expressing individual opinions and ought emphasizing a common opinion regarding the obligation in question. This use of obligation should does not occur in five plays written between 1889 and 1911, appearing for the first time in this database in a play written in 1926. The development of obligation should parallels other changes in the modal system which have taken place at the same time – as should has increased in frequency, so have the other individually-oriented modals got to and gonna , and as ought has declined in frequency, so have the other group-oriented modals must and will.']",1,0

"[""Abstract In the last few decades, the relationship between linguistics and Marxism has given rise to an important debate among experts on the Italian political thinker and leader Antonio Gramsci (1891–1937). The paper summarises this debate in connection with recent research on Gramsci's intellectual biography, starting from his university training in historical linguistics as well as other sources for his early views on language (Section 2 ). Section 3 focuses on his subsequent encounter with sociological and applied linguistics in revolutionary Russia, where Marx was an oft-cited author. This historical review sets the ground for a reappraisal of Gramsci's Prison Notebooks, written during the last part of his life (Section 4 ), and of their contribution to the language sciences – which, I argue, is better understood if we reject the idea of a contrast between Gramsci's Marxism and his linguistic ideas (Section 5 ). Finally, a brief concluding section recapitulates the various aspects discussed, especially the role of Marxist and non-Marxist sources in shaping Gramsci's views and relevance to today's linguists.""]",1,0

Si cette théorie linguistique est aujourd’hui très largement diffusée en linguistique francophone ethispanique, elle reste en revanche assez peu connue en dehors de ces deux domaines. Nous commenceronsdonc par résumer les grandes caractéristiques de la psychomécanique du langage (la dichotomie langue/discours et la notion d’acte de langage, le temps opératif, la construction du mot avec l’idéogénèse et lamorphogénèse, la notion d’incidence et le signifié de puissance), puis nous étudierons de façon précise la formeVAR.

With forensic applications in mind, the following questions are. asked : ( 1) are trained listeners better at estimating a speaker s chronological age than untrained listeners, (2) are listeners more confident about correct estimates than incorrect ones and (3) do a speaker's smoking habits influence perceived age? The results of an experiment involving direct age estimations by experts and non-experts reveal that professionals cannot be expected to do significantly better than the untrained listeners as long as correlations between perceived age and calendar age are considered. However, phonetic training did manifest itself in greater intersubject consistency. Furthermore, smoking can be demonstrated to influence age estimation in the sense that the smokers were judged to be older than non-smokers of the same calendar age. An examination of the confidence ratings shows that expert listeners tend to be more cautious than non-experts, but confidence does not imply correctness for either group.""]",1,0

"['If ‘the scream’ can at times burst out of the poem like a brutal rupture (unhinged syntax, staccato rhythm, aggressive tone), it can also make itself heard otherwise. In the courtly lyricism of the late Middle Ages, a model of pure technical perfection, ‘the scream’, if any, is rather perceptible in the gaps, discords and splits of the text - in fact, all elements revealing the poet’s powerlessness in ‘having his say’. Le Livre messire Ode by Oton de Granson lends itself to an analysis of the manifold expressions of ‘the scream’. Sometimes mimicked through interjections, it however betrays itself more often in the attenuated form of a lament. But its presence is more pronounced in all the details which disrupt the narrative, shatter its coherence and introduce dissonances. ‘Dead ends’, repetitions (and a polyphonic system where the multiplicity of voices - all relays and echoes of the narrating ‘I’ - remains a mingling of clashing bits and pieces) give us to understand ‘the other scream’, in the hinterlands... The end of the text, a sequence of lyrical pieces haunted with the motif of the vanity of language, emphasizes the sparseness and discontinuity of a text which does not achieve its end of converting suffering into song - thus, if the repressed scream does not turn into a consistent piece of verse, it is made to hover between or behind the words; some thing beyond any wording, which weighs down the tongue, even that of poetry some thing beyond articulation, which spells fragmentation.']",1,0

['抽象 本文在韵律音系学理论框架下对福州方言的粘附成分与粘附组进行分析。在前人针对不同语言的粘附成分与粘附组所做探讨的基础上，本文从构词句法功能与音系表现两个方面，对福州方言的相关材料进行了全面分析，揭示了福州方言粘附成分与其他语言粘附成分在构词句法与音系上的共同特征。福州方言的两类粘附组在音系表现上存在不对称的现象，然而，与其他韵律单位相比，福州方言粘附组作为一个整体仍然具有十分特殊的音系表现，这为福州方言中粘附组这一韵律单位的设立提供了动因与证据。此外，福州方言的粘附成分可以选择韵律层级中位置高于韵律词的韵律单位作为宿主，这对韵律音系学理论中的严格分层假设构成了巨大的挑战。这一挑战利用弱化的严格分层假设即可得到合理的解释，而无需将粘附组这一韵律单位排除在韵律层级之外。'],1,0

"[""Perhaps there is no better illustration of Bourdieu's view that language can be converted to political or economic power (1991) than the success of the New Oriental School, which started as an English teaching organization, with the motto ‘Language is power’, mainly to prepare Chinese students for the TOFEL and the GRE tests. They have been so successful that they have now expanded into a full-scale educational institution, with English as its key component. Also, many people in China have prospered through English, including the world-famous teacher Li Yang, who achieved phenomenal success with his ‘Crazy English’ method, whose approach pushes a language-as-power message. In addition, the prosperity of the publishing houses selling English materials, the huge number of the teachers, and the enormous English-learning population in China all seem to contribute to the belief that English can enrich anyone who can find a way to capitalize on the language. However, despite the booming success of various English training agencies, it is ironic that English departments at Chinese universities now face an unprecedented crisis for survival. One major reason for this is that the recent craze for English in China has been accompanied by a parallel and steep decline of interest in the study of English as a ‘major’ at university level. In this article, I will address the problems that English departments in universities have in their response to the practical turn in English studies, with reference to the teaching of writing to English majors in particular.""]",1,0

"[""Author's Introduction\r\n\r\nThe field of language dynamics encompasses the study and modeling of how languages develop (language evolution), change, and interact (language competition). It contrasts with traditional historical linguistics in several ways: the focus is on the world's linguistic diversity rather than just on specific languages or language families; methods are quantitative rather than qualitative; computer simulations are employed for elucidating situations that are not immediately observable, being too complex or pertaining to prehistory; the data used are systematic ones gathered in large databases rather than data that happen to be available for select languages. A crucial feature of the methodology is the fine-tuning of simulation models through empirical observations of quantitative distributions such as those of speaker populations or of grammatical features shared among languages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAuthor Recommends\r\n\r\nAmong the following papers the two first are recommended because of the great impact on the field of language dynamics that they have had, and the following three are recommended because they provide useful and up-to-date overviews.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.\u2002Abrams, Daniel, and Steven H.

"['Intergenerational transmission, the ultimate goal of language revitalization efforts, can only be achieved by (re)establishing the conditions under which an imperiled language can be acquired by the community’s children. This paper presents a tutorial survey of several key points relating to language acquisition and maintenance in children, focusing on four matters that are of direct relevance to work on language revitalization. 1. Introduction1 It is a matter of consensus that the most telling measure of language vitality is intergenerational transmission. It is the decisive criterion in Fishman’s (1991) pioneering scale of language endangerment, and a major component of all subsequent work in the field (UNESCO 2003, Krauss 2007, Lewis & Simons 2010, Moseley 2010); see Lee & van Way (to appear) for a review. Indeed, the most sophisticated system for the assessment of language vitality, the recently developed Language Endangerment Index used by the Catalogue of Endangered Languages (http://www.endangeredlanguages.com/), assigns intergenerational transmission twice the weight of the other three factors on which it relies2 (Lee & van Way to appear). Intergenerational transmission is nothing more nor less than language acquisition: a language is transmitted to the next generation only to the extent that it is acquired by the community’s children. This simple fact raises two closely related questions: i) What are the conditions under which children acquire and maintain the language']",1,0

"['This article addresses a vital concern in current society by showing what participants themselves may treat as ways to transcend their differences. Actors’ shared understanding has been of longstanding interest across the social sciences. Conversation analysis (CA) treats the procedural infrastructure of interaction as the basis for participants to manage intersubjectivity. The field of dialogue studies has made occasions in which people transform their relationship by discussing their differences, central to their research project, and called them “dialogic moments.” This study draws on CA to investigate “dialogic moments,” but now through the eyes of participants themselves. Using single-case analysis, we argue that such moments require participants to go against normative orientations in talk promoting social solidarity and progressivity, by soliciting differences to understand and transcend them. This “going against the interactional tide” may explain both why dialogue is difficult to achieve and why it is appreciated by participants as dialogue.']",1,0

"['Les auteurs, prenant appui sur la notion de prise de risques linguistiques, s’intéressent à un nouveau projet pédagogique de l’Université d’Ottawa, établissement où les cours, les programmes et les services sont offerts à la fois en anglais et en français. Dans ce contexte bilingue, ils définissent les risques linguistiques comme étant des actes de communication authentiques dans la langue officielle seconde des apprenants (français ou anglais), susceptibles de présenter un « risque » en raison de divers facteurs liés notamment à la possibilité de commettre des erreurs, d’être mal compris, de mal comprendre les interlocuteurs, d’être jugé, de changer d’identité et de modifier des modèles de choix linguistique précédemment établis. Ces risques peuvent amener les apprenants à laisser passer les occasions qui leur sont offertes sur l’ensemble du campus de s’investir de manière authentique et signifiante dans l’apprentissage de la langue seconde. Afin d’encourager la prise de risques, les auteurs conçoivent un projet dans le cadre duquel ils proposent un passeport de prise de risques linguistiques (un livret de 26 pages dans lequel sont répertoriés plus de 70 risques) qu’ils distribuent à plus de 500 apprenants du français ou de l’anglais. Les risques répertoriés correspondent à des activités authentiques situées à l’extérieur des classes de langue (par exemple, parler dans la langue seconde à la bibliothèque, s’adresser à un passant pour demander sa route, commander des aliments à la cafétéria, interagir avec les professeurs ou les gestionnaires, participer à des événements, etc.). Les apprenants cochent eux-mêmes les risques énumérés dans leurs passeports à mesure qu’ils les prennent, formulent des observations sur les niveaux de difficulté, proposent d’autres risques et peuvent soumettre leurs passeports en vue de l’obtention de prix. Les auteurs recensent les concepts théoriques liés à la prise de risques linguistiques, précisent les détails de l’élaboration du projet et concluent par des orientations futures, notamment quant à l’usage de la technologie.']",1,0

In VC 1 C 2 sequences, the tongue apex began RL anticipatory movements toward C 2 during the steady-state vowel segment in approximately 44% of the cases. Perturbations of tongue movement related to labial closures and subsequent oral pressure build up was observed.

['Pylkkäne把施用结构分为高低两层，为处理施用论元的跨语言语法行为提供了新的视角和分析方法。然而，其对低层施用词素ApplL的处理方法存在多重根本性问题，其中最显著的问题是在语义上把ApplL 当作VP的论元，但在句法上却当作VP的内部成分。这显然与论元关系所呈现出的句法-语义高度一致性相违背。针对这些问题，本文提出了新的解决方案，设定了ApplL的两个功能：1)引进施用论元，并界定施用论元和受事论元之间的所有者和被所有者关系；2)核查V所指称的事件是否允准所有者关系的转移。这两大功能决定了ApplL和V之间不可能存在论元关系或修饰关系，而只能把两种独立的语法信息直接叠加，共同构成相关句法成分的核心内容。令ApplL类比φ特征，V类比T，两者组合构成V-ApplL。在句法语义规则限制下，组合结果既能解释低层施用论元的语法语义行为，又能避免Pylkkänen理论的弊病。'],1,0

"['Acoustic evidence for temporal overlap of the two closure gestures in the environment VC ≠ CV was investigated. It was hypothesized that evidence of C 2 would be found in the VC formant transitions and would increasingly dominate the transitions as rate (and, by hypothesis, overlap) increased. Twenty repetitions (10 at a normal rate and 10 at a rapid rate) of word pairs where the first word ended in /d/ and the second began with /p/, /t/, or /k/ were elicited in a sentence context from four subjects. F 2 and F 3 transitions from the midpoint of V 1 , to just before closure were then measured. In all environments, C 2 had a clear influence on the VC formant transitions. The rate effects were less clear. For the /d ≠ k/ environment, a significant correlation was found between more prominent velar transitions and increasing ratio of vowel duration to consonant closure duration, which may be considered a measure of increasing consonant overlap. The acoustic influence of C 2 on V 1 , suggests considerable temporal overlap of the two closure gestures, and at least for the /d ≠ k/ case, increasing overlap as a function of one strategy for increasing rate.']",1,0

"[""T EUER abbreviations have been accepted as a part of the American L scene for a long time. The modern ones, such as AF A. A. for Agricultural Adjustment Administration, K. O. for Knockout, and D. V. O. T. for Dog Vomit on Toast, once heard among pre-war Americans in Oxford University, summarizing their disrespect for British food, are merely in line with a tradition long established. For instance, P. G. for Public Gaol turns up in 1y48 in a Virginia document; F. m. c. for Free man of color had a cuirency from 1840 to the end of the Civil War; A. for Adulteress, now obsolescent, had a brisk vogue during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries; F. F. V. for First Families of Virginia has been used from 1847 to the present day; and 1V. G. for No Go, or No Good, has been common since 1840. But 0. K. is king of all American abbreviations. It is uttered probably one billion times a day in the United States, more or less, and is undoubtedly the most popular of all abbreviations. Yet it is not known for certain what the two letters stand for, or why the expression ever arose. Interest in its origin has aroused speculation and hard work by many a common man and historian; and theories about it have been about as plentiful as sunshine in New Mexico. I have been bitten by the 0. K. bug, and have spent long hours and effort in running down various clues. I suspect I have taken more pains with the records involved in this problem than any other afflicted person. I have worked with all the material collected for the Dictionary of American EnglisZ;-I have contributed several items to its files, checked, in photographs or in original manuscripts, all the relevant documents, and brought the whole effort to a focus by editing the 0. K. entries in the dictionary. This may not qualify me to appear before a Congressional committee on national defense? but it has given me courage to clear the ground of some false notions of the origin of 0. K. Mr. Mencken, in his admirable book, The American Language (pp. 206-207), lists ten theories of 0. K.'s origin. At least nine of these theories are pure guesses without any supporting evidence, and Mr. Mencken 1S justified in tossing them back at their authors with a few terse comments.

In passing from Rousseau’s essay to Herder’s—although they are separated by only twenty-two years, and by the distance between Paris and Strassburg—we step clearly over the threshold from medievalism into the new world of free philosophical investigation, into an atmosphere as clear as that in which Plato and Aristotle worked. Herder’s essay on language is the starting point for all the scientific work that has since been done on that subject, and has thus a very important historical significance in addition to its permanent scientific value. Its full significance, however, can be fully appreciated only in relation to the general scientific and philosophic thought of the time, and it will be necessary to digress for a few pages to describe the intellectual atmosphere in which Herder worked in the latter half of the eighteenth century in Germany.']",1,0

Navorsers het al hoe meer die waarde begin insien van meer prosesgeorienteerde navorsing in vertaalstudie. Die Franse sosioloog Bruno Latour se Akteur-Netwerk-Teorie (oftewel ANT) laat die navorser die objek van navorsing nie as substantiewe verskynsel beskou nie, maar as ’n netwerk van verhoudinge deur ’n studie te maak van die betrokke mense en objekte (akteurs en aktante) en die wisselwerking tussen hulle. Binne hierdie teoretiese raamwerk is etnografie of ’n etnometodologie besonder gepas omdat dit die navorser nader bring aan die beleefde ervaring. Opvoedkundige tolking, of mondelinge tolking in klaskamers vir niegehoorgestremde studente, is ’n innoverende toepassing van tolking, en ook ’n grootliks onontginde kennisveld. Dit is as taalmodus by die nuwe Taalbeleid van die Universiteit Stellenbosch (US 2016) ingesluit ter wille van die praktiese uitvoerbaarheid van meertaligheid. In die praktyk is opvoedkundige tolking egter dikwels onderhewig aan onrealistiese verwagtinge, en die waarde daarvan in ’n opvoedkundige konteks bly kontensieus. Empiriese navorsing in getolkte klasse binne ’n raamwerk van ANT kan moontlik lig werp op die wisselwerking tussen die onderskeie faktore in opvoedkundige tolking en hoe hulle funksioneer. Hierdie artikel ondersoek die waarde van ANT na aanleiding van data wat gedurende veldwerk in 36 getolkte lesings aan die Universiteit Stellenbosch ingesamel is. Dit toon hoe ’n etnometodologie binne die teoretiese raamwerk van ANT die navorser in staat stel om verder en dieper te beskryf; om gebeure, verwantskappe, verskynsels en situasies wat tot nog toe onvertel was, aan die lig te bring. Uiteindelik kan hierdie bevindings waardevol wees vir taalimplementering aan die Universiteit Stellenbosch en die soeke na prakties uitvoerbare meertaligheidspraktyke aan Suid-Afrikaanse universiteite.']",1,0

A number of noun phrases are examined here and, as will become obvious later, the language relies heavily on tone to express many grammatical categories. The main points of interest from this study include the preservation of H at the expense of L, the fact that the loss of L does not result in downstep, that 'H plus following H can give H so the down step can be deleted, and that there are syntactically conditioned floating H tones in certain constructions.""]",1,0

A idade dos alunos varia entre 15 e 62 anos, o que dificulta a proposta das aulas.

Les études antérieures ont révélé que la production d’ARAA varie notamment en fonction du niveau de compétence langagière des apprenants, de la complexité de la tâche de production orale ou encore des différences individuelles. Dans le cadre de la présente étude, la mémoire phonologique et la capacité de commutation de l’attention ont été examinées en relation avec la production d’ARAA chez 30 francophones adultes apprenants de l’anglais L2. La capacité de commutation de l’attention a été opérationnalisée au moyen du TMT et la mémoire phonologique, au moyen d’une tâche de reconnaissance de non-mots. Les ARAA, recueillies lors d’une narration à partir d’images, ont été codées par deux juges. Les résultats des analyses factorielles en composantes principales montrent que tandis qu’une meilleure capacité de commutation de l’attention est en lien avec une plus grande production d’ARAA centrées sur les choix de mots, une meilleure mémoire phonologique est en lien avec une production moindre d’ARAA centrées sur la forme.']",1,0

"['In many unrelated languages, the same anaphor is either subject to Condition A of the binding theory, or exempt from it but with specific interpretive properties. On the basis of French data and crosslinguistic comparisons, I first show that such exempt anaphors must be anteceded by logophoric centers. Elaborating on but modifying Sells 1987 , I provide specific tests to argue that these logophoric antecedents can be classified into two kinds of perspective centers, attitude holders and empathy loci, thus reducing logophoricity to mental perspective. Next, I propose to derive the logophoricity of exempt anaphors from the following hypothesis: seemingly exempt anaphors are in fact bound by silent logophoric pronouns introduced by syntactically represented logophoric operators within their local domain. Crucially, this hypothesis, which is independently supported by exhaustive coreference constraints on locally cooccurring exempt anaphors, also accounts for their apparent exemption from Condition A, reanalyzed here as local binding by a silent logophoric binder.']",1,0

"['Problems in New-Word Lexicography John Algeo .Had lexicographers but world enough and time, they would no doubt include in their dictionaries every lexical item ever used by any speaker or writer of English, with all recoverable information about each item. To be sure, such a dictionary would be more than most users want. The users of a particular dictionary obviously have needs that circumscribe the appropriate contents of that book. But within such user-oriented limitations, the impossible dream of the lexicographer is exhaustive comprehensiveness—a complete listing of all lexical items with complete information about each. This dream of a full accounting for lexis is a mystical vision of the linguistic plenum. As Dr. Johnson observed in his melancholy way, such visions are ""the dreams of a poet doomed at last to wake a lexicographer."" The jangling alarm that wakes the lexicographer is the sound of ""Time\'s winged chariot hurrying near,"" driven by some soulless accountant who cares for the bottom line and not at all for the main entry. The lexicographer \'s bitter task is selection—deciding what to include and what to leave out. And his lot is therefore not a happy one. The problem of selection is particularly keen in new-word lexicography , where it has two aspects: the definition of what a new word is and the decisions of which new words to include and of what to say about them. The problem of definition—deciding what is new and what is not—is especially troublesome in new-word glossaries. The problem of inclusion, on the other hand, is general: the editor of every new or revised dictionary is faced with the need to make decisions about which new words, however defined, will be included and which omitted. In these remarks I propose to examine some of the questions that need to be answered in deciding about inclusion. The aim is not to provide answers, which must in any case depend on purposes, re- 40 ___ John Algeo sources, and the bottom line. Robert Burchfield (1989, 105) defined his policy in editing the OED Supplement (OEDS) as follows: ""The main governing factor in the choice of words to be treated is the editability of a given item in the time available and with the resources at my disposal ."" That is a practical answer, taking into account Time\'s winged chariot and its soulless charioteer, but it does not tell how priorities are decided. The aim here is to identify issues that bear upon the priorities. What are the factors that guide the lexicographer\'s decision, wherever the bottom line may be drawn? The examples used to illustrate the questions are drawn from three dictionaries published during the past two years: Random House Webster\'s College Dictionary, 1991 (RHWCD); The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, 3d ed., 1992 (AHD3); and Merriam-Webster\'s Collegiate® Dictionary, 10th ed., 1993 (WlO); and from two periodical records of neology: The Barnhart Dictionary Companion (BDC) and American Speech\'s ""Among the New Words"" (ANW). The Oxford English Dictionary, 2d ed., on compact disk, 1992 (OED2CD), has also been checked for these items, and the Dictionary of American Regional English (DARE), 1985-, has been consulted for appropriate items. In all, 1 1 questions are asked. The first question will be examined in some detail, and the remaining ones more superficially. Yet other questions are obviously possible and appropriate. QUESTION 1: When does an expression that is grammatically predictable become lexicalized and thus deserving of dictionary entry? The recently popular (and controversial) term politically correct is an example. There are entries for it in the RHWCD, WlO, and the BDC. The RHWCD definition both applies the term specifically to the political left and identifies the areas of discourse to which it applies: ""marked by or adhering to a typically progressive orthodoxy on issues involving esp. race, gender, sexual affinity, or ecology."" (Incidentally, the expression sexual affinity used in that definition as a politically correct term for homosexuality contrasted with heterosexuality is not defined in the RHWCD, although it is by no means analytical or transparent .) The WlO definition specifies the areas of discourse in which the term is...']",1,0

"['Abstract The analysis of gapping still leaves many questions open. At least three aspects remain controversial: whether it involves unpronounced structure, whether clausal or non-clausal constituents are conjoined, and whether all gapped sentences are must be analyzed uniformly. On the basis of French gapped constructions such as Marie n’est jamais allée à Rome ni Jean à Pékin ‘Mary never went to Rome nor John to Beijing’, the paper argues that gapping is not an homogeneous phenomenon. It first shows that in such gapped clauses involving ni, a strict Negative Polarity Item, a negation low inside the first TP can license the ‘negative coordinator’ ni, a fact that a TP-deletion analysis of gapping or a fragment coordination one can capture. Conversely, it shows that a vP-coordination analysis correctly predicts the properties of ni-gapped clauses. However, such an analysis cannot extend to gapped clauses conjoined by double ni : the second conjunct, this time, must be a full clause or a fragment.']",1,0

"[""THAT upstart popular slang word, Scram, has a short but lively history. Its origin is uncertain. Columnists, comic strip artists, and then the less boisterous writers adopted it, interpreted and defined it, and helped to make for it a full set of grammatical forms. The creation of distorted variants, a game with today's generation, has even twisted scram to amskray and scramola. H. L. Mencken at one point1 credits a New York writer, Conway, who died in 1928, with the invention of to scram. A few pages later,2 however, Mencken speaks of scram in the vocabulary of the incarcerated children in orphanages as a borrowing from criminal cant. But L. W. Merryweather, who assembled some of the terms used in orphanages cited by Mencken, lists scram as a borrowing from newspapers and movies.3 And in listing some of Conway's coinages Walter Winchell did not include scram in 1927 in 'A Primer of Broadway Slang,'4 although he recorded the synonymous take it on the lam 'make a quick getaway or hurried disappearance.'5 He mentions it, however, in his column 'Your Broadway and Mine'G on October 4, 1928.

"[""In the early paper(Yu 2003),a contrastive study on the acoustic differences of basic vowels between Standard Mandarin,or Putonghua(also referred to as SC for Standard Chinese) and Shanghaiaccented Mandarin(ASH) has been made.But in addition to the rich inventory of basic vowels,SC has 9 diphthongs[ai,ei,ao,ou,ia,ie,ua,uo,ye].This paper will mainly focus on those diphthongs and try to find out the differences between SC and ASH,and conclude the acoustic and articulatory features of ASH diphthongs.The database used in this study was NOKIA-CASS,a special speech corpus designed and recorded for comparative study between SC and ASH.Here only the speech corpus for Shanghai part was used.All the recorded utterances were phonetically annotated on orthographic and pronunciation tiers by using Praat.Pronunciation variables or phonemic changes caused by dialect were annotated dedicatedly.Accents of ASH were first classified into three categories as light,medium and heavy by subjective criteria by dialectologists and objective criteria from statistical results obtained from the phonetic annotation.Then 9 diphthongs for 20 SC and 20 ASH speakers with medium accent were compared both on phonological and phonetic level.Our final findings are:(1) During the production of diphthongs for both SC and ASH speakers,target undershoots take place due to the relative short duration allocated for a particular target element as well as the co-articulatory influence of the adjacent element.(2) As an interlanguage,ASH shows its unique features:first,the location of its acoustic vocalic triangle is between Shanghai dialect(SHD) and SC,particularly female speakers;second,under the influence of SHD,the whole vocalic space of diphthongs in ASH speakers keeps more peripheral and front than that in SC speakers,which reveals the systematic features in the interlanguage's vowel system.(3) By individual T-test,the differences of the diphthongs between SC and ASH female speakers show greater significance;regarding the male speakers,data lacks consistency.It seems most ASH female speakers,to some extent,maintain the accent more permanently when acquiring Mandarin diphthongs.(4) The formant patterns of[ai,ao,ou,ie,ye]for SC and ASH male speakers show greater differences,and the third formant trajectory of[ai,ou,ao]for ASH male speakers are lower than that for SC male speakers;while for female speakers,the formant patterns of[ai,ao,ou,ye,ia,ua]show greater differences and the third formant trajectory of[ai,ao,ou,ye,ia,ua]for ASH female speakers are all located at higher position than for SC female speakers.It indicates that compared with SC speakers,most ASH male speakers can produce round vowels well but have problems with openness of[a];while most ASH female speakers just do the things the other way round.(5) Comparatively speaking,all the diphthongs produced by male speakers are more centralized and show less dynamic vowel movement than those produced by female speakers.""]",1,0

"[""N 1931, DURING THE MIDST of the Great Depression, an unemployed architect named Alfred M. Butts created a game he called Lexico (see Benjamin 1981, from which this brief history has been compiled). It was a simple game, requiring only luck, a good vocabulary, and a certain amount of tactical skill as its players arranged small wooden tiles in crosswordpuzzle fashion to make words. Initially, Butts intended Lexico to be a diversion for his family alone, but they enjoyed it so much that he soon made several replicas and began retailing them at a neighborhood store for $1.50 each. Over the next five years, Lexico enjoyed a very limited success-a success that did not improve greatly when Butts changed Lexico's name to Criss Cross Words in 1936. Soon after that, however, Butts metJames Bronot, an enterprising New York businessman who suggested changing the name of the game to Scrabble and finding better ways to market it.' Fortunately for Butts, he took both of Bronot's suggestions, and the rest, as they say, is history: the game was eventually sold to the Selchow and Righter company in 1949, and today Scrabble is the largestselling board game in the United States, outselling even Monopoly by an estimated twenty percent. Every Eden has its serpent, however, and the world of Scrabble was no exception. Put simply, its players frequently disagreed as to what constituted a word (for example, were words heard on the street or read in a novel acceptable, or did they have to derive from some more authoritative source?), and although such squabbles did not threaten the stability of the families in which the game was played, they assumed considerably more importance as various Scrabble tournaments and contests began to appear. The most frequent course of action taken-and the one recommended by the rules of the game-was to check a standard dictionary, but this led only to further complications. Because no two dictionaries contain exactly the same words (not to mention derivatives and spelling variations), which one was to be used as the ultimate means ofjudgment?

"[""Presentation at the CEL/ELC Forum, on Languages and societal challenges. The role of higher education, in Milan December 20161Dear Professor Conceicâo, lieber Wolfgang, Professoressa Zanola, dear colleagues and friends,Thank you for inviting me to take part in this interesting Forum. And thank you for bringing me back to this city where I did my studies some 40 years ago - my high school was just a few minutes' walk from here.When I was an undisciplined student of the Liceo Classico Alessandro Manzoni, at the turning point between late 1960s and early 1970s, the school programme included English or French courses for the first two years; then, at 15 or 16, you would quit studying foreign languages to focus on ancient Greek, Latin, History, Philosophy and so on.Somehow, it was thought that such a limited exposure was enough for young learners that would mostly go on to higher education. And that probably made sense - at the time.* Most of my class- and schoolmates would become doctors, lawyers, teachers, engineers, managers or civil servants and could reasonably expect to spend their private and professional lives in this area, one of the most developed in Italy.* Until 1979, TV sets in Italy only gave you access to the two channels of the state broadcasting company RAI, whose policy was - and still is - to erase any trace of foreign languages from the news, from films and, if they could, even from pop music. In Italy we are so proud of our dubbing specialists that you'll never see subtitles.* The Internet Protocol wasn't introduced until 1982.* Erasmus came into life in 1987.* You did not meet that many foreigners in the streets and, unless you spent your holidays in Val d'Aosta, in South Tyrol or close to the Slovenian border, you had little opportunities of hearing words from different dictionaries. Admittedly, German and Nordic tourists brought an exotic touch to the beaches of the Adriatic coast.Today, of course, things are quite different and we all live in a society for which that school had hardly prepared us.Our countries belong to a continental Union, where monolingual spaces are shrinking by the day. More than 60 languages have some sort of official recognition at regional or national level in the Union. Many more - either indigenous or carried across the sea or through heavily guarded borders by citizens of other continents - are spoken by millions of new Europeans.Even categorising those languages is becoming increasingly difficult: we have regional, minority, non-territorial languages, as well as heritage or community languages, not to mention the so-called world languages, and some of these named languages move from one category to the other following the geo-political and economic developments of the planet. I will come back to this point.Intra-European mobility, migration, the development of information and communication technologies, the interconnectedness of our globalised economy and society, but also the growing requests for autonomy of some regions, have radically transformed the needs in terms of language education. As a consequence, education systems that for the last couple of centuries had devoted their efforts towards unifying and standardising the usage of the national language find themselves once again struggling with diversity.Diversity in the input of pupils, whose different abilities to manage the language of schooling come today under scrutiny following the arrival of children of foreign origin, but in many cases may also have other reasons, such as the social, economic and cultural conditions of their families. And diversity in the learning outcomes, since ministries around the Union have come to realise that it is important for young people to master a broad array of languages and linguistic competences.Lowering the starting age for the study of the first foreign language seems to be a common reply to this new needs: on average, this happens between age 7 and 9, with France now starting in pre-school (classes preparatoires). …""]",1,0

"['Numerous studies have been conducted on acculturation. These studies include defining, conceptualizing, operationalizing and measuring acculturation. The emphasis of this body of research, however, has been on the acculturation of adults. The process of acculturation occurs among children and adolescents also. In academic settings, students are expected to acculturate to the school and are expected to perform academically like other students. When students are confronted with literacy demands coupled with the multi-faceted, multi-layered process of acculturation, development of literacy skills will be influenced. It is important to determine whether cultural factors influence reading assessment and skills before evaluating other literacy dimensions. Therefore the purpose of this study was to examine the effects of acculturation on reading achievement. Twenty-three 7th through 9th grade Latino students in a small rural midwestern town participated in the project. The Acculturation Quick Screen (Collier, 1988) and Franco’s (1983) Children’s Acculturation Scale were used to assess acculturation to the school environment (the former) and their own culture (the latter). Reading scores on the Iowa Test of Basic Skills (ITBS) were used as their reading achievement measure. Results of two correlations revealed no significant findings, suggesting that a limited relationship exists between acculturation and reading achievement. Qualitative findings indicated that students could maintain their first culture without significantly affecting reading achievement.']",1,0

"['Socioeconomic status (SES)-related language gaps are known to widen throughout the course of the school years; however, not all children from lower SES homes perform worse than their higher SES peers on measures of language. The current study uses mediation and moderated mediation to examine how cognitive and language abilities (vocabulary, reading, phonological processing, working memory) account for individual differences in children’s ability to infer a novel word’s meaning, a key component in word learning, in school-aged children from varying SES backgrounds. Vocabulary and reading comprehension mediated the relationship between SES and accuracy when inferring word meanings. The relationship between SES, vocabulary, and inferring word meaning was moderated by age, such that the influence of vocabulary on task performance was strongest in young children. The reading pathway did not interact with age effects, indicating reading is an important contributor to SES-related differences in how children infer a word’s meaning throughout grade school. These findings highlight different paths by which children’s trajectories for inferring word meanings may be impacted.']",1,0

"['In this article we take a functionalist approach to psycholinguistic modelling; in particular we aim to show how linguistic theoretical findings may help to understand the processes involved in natural language comprehension. The present research reports three experiments on the comprehension of French subject relative clauses and two forms of object relative clauses. In French, object relative clauses can be constructed with either a canonical subject-verb order, as in English, or with an inverted verb-subject order. Three self-paced reading tasks used this last structure, along with canonical object relatives (Experiment 1) and with subject relatives (Experiment 1, 2, 3) in a center-embedding construction. Comprehension accuracy rates and reading times were recorded in order to test predictions drawn from the Competition Model of Bates and MacWhinney (1982, Language Acquisition: The State of Art , pp. 173–218, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; 1987, Mechanisms of Language Acquisition , pp. 157–193, Lawrence Erlbaum, Hillsdale, NJ; 1989, The Cross-linguistic Study of Sentence Processing , pp. 3–73, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge). Experiment 1 was intended to test the hypothesis that competition between NPs, memory load and perspective maintenance were the main determinants of the difficulty of role assignment in reversible relative clauses. In Experiment 2 and 3, subject relatives and inverted object relatives were compared, with several cues varied to evaluate their effect on role assignment.']",1,0

"['Earlier literature on Bantu languages claimed that interrogative WH constructions in Bantu languages involve no WH movement (see Bokamba, 1976; Kimenyi, 1980). Using data from Ikalanga (an understudied Bantu language spoken in Botswana), this paper challenges this view and argues that although this language has WH in situ, WH constructions with left edge and right edge WH phrases prefixed with ndi- involve movement. Three island tests (the NP island test, the WH island test and the Adjunct island test) are used as movement diagnostics. Further evidence that WH phrases prefixed with ndi- involve movement comes from morphological facts. Once it is established that these WH constructions involve movement, the seemingly unusual position occupied by right edge WH phrases (including subject WH phrases) is explained in a principled and straight forward way; that is, Ikalanga is (at least partially) a discourse configurational language and thus the discourse properties of the language induce movement of a remnant TopP to a high position stranding the WH phrase. This discovery situates Ikalanga in the same language typology as languages like Hungarian, for example. The analysis adopted in this paper lends support to the much discussed remnant movement analysis (see among others Muller, 1998; Epstein, 2001; Mahajan, 1997, 2000; Culicover and Rochement, 1997), showing that remnant movement is a phenomenon permitted by universal principles of grammar.']",1,0

"[""• Tendency to overgeneralize is documented in Polish. • Making exceptions salient reduces the generic overgeneralization effect. • Generic overgeneralization effect is reduced but not eliminated. • Reduction of the bias is attributed to the analytical mode of thinking. In this paper we examine people's tendency to accept false universal statements such as all storks fly to Africa or all lions have manes as true even though they know such statements are false. Similar outcome studies have sparked two different explanations for this puzzle: the generic overgeneralization effect ( Leslie et al., 2011 ) and the quantifier domain restriction ( Lazaridou-Chatzigoga et al., 2019 ). Following the modified research design by Lazaridou-Chatzigoga et al. (2019) , our study aimed to maximally restrict the reported tendency among native Polish speakers by making them adopt an analytical mode of thinking. Contrary to the view held by Lazaridou-Chatzigoga et al., we assumed that the type of context has an impact on the acceptance rates of false universal statements. By controlling three types of contexts: natural, kind-driven/gender-driven, and exception-driven, we showed that this tendency can be attenuated but not eliminated. The paper concludes with a discussion of the assumptions held by two groups of researchers and argues that the generic overgeneralization effect is the only coherent explanation developed so far.""]",1,0

"[""Bound to be widely read and much discussed, The Elm and the Expert, written in Jerry Fodor's usual highly readable, irreverent style, provides a lively discussion of semantic issues about mental representation, with special attention to issues raised by Frege's problem, Twin cases, and the putative indeterminacy of reference. The book extends and revises a view of the relation between mind and meaning that the author has been developing since his 1975 book, The Language of Thought. There is a general consensus among philosophers that a referential semantics for mental representation cannot support a robust account of intentional explanation. Fodor has himself espoused this view in previous publications, and it is widespread (if tacit) throughout the cognitive science community. This book is largely a reconsideration of the arguments that are supposed to ground this consensus. Fodor concludes that these considerations are far less decisive than has been supposed. He offers a theory sketch in which psychological explanation is intentional, psychological processes are computational, and the semantic properties of mental representations are referential. Connections with the problem of naturalizing intentionality are also explored. The four lectures in The Elm and the Expert were originally delivered in Paris in the spring of 1993 to inaugurate the Jean Nicod Lecture series. The Jean Nicod Lectures are delivered annually by a leading philosopher of mind or philosophically oriented cognitive scientist. The 1993 lectures marked the centenary of the birth of the French philosopher and logician Jean Nicod (1893-1931).

"['It is well-known that grammatical movement is somehow linked to functional heads. There is less agreement on the excact nature of this correlation. According to one view, phrases are moved to the specifier positions of functional heads because functional heads attract them. According to another view, movement is not triggered by functional heads alone, but depends on the larger grammatical context. For instance, one such proposal says that T (tense) becomes attractive only when selected by finite C (complementizer), while V becomes attractive when selected by v * (transitivizer). What attracts phrases are therefore the C–T system and the v *–V system as a whole, not the individual functional heads; moved phrases are then sandwitched between the two heads. In this article, we present evidence in favor of this view by looking at first language acquisition. The data shows that in child Finnish, subject determiner phrases (DPs) move into the position of grammatical subject if and only if the full complementizer system has matured. Movement to the (Spec, TP) subject position therefore depends on the presence of C.']",1,0

"['Abstract This study compared the language skills in a group of very low-income toddlers with those of a middle-income sample matched on age and sex. The assessment instrument was the MacArthur Communicative Development Inventory (CDI) for toddlers, a parent report form. The scores for the low-income group were strikingly lower on the three key indices evaluated: size of expressive vocabulary, age of appearance of word combinations, and complexity of utterances. The entire lowincome distribution was shifted about 30% toward the lower end of the middle-income distribution for both productive vocabulary and grammatical development. The magnitude of these income/ social class effects was larger than reported in most prior reports for children in this age range. This finding underscores the cautionary note issued by the CDI developers, which states that the published CDI norms, based on a middle-class sample, may not be directly applicable to low-income samples.']",1,0

"['In a somewhat condescending review of A Dictionary of Canadianisms on Historical Principles some years ago, Mavor Moore complained about “a slighting of spoken practice and of distinctive Canadian syntax,” among his objections being the absence of an entry for eh? , for “both the English and the Americans can spot a Canadian from his ‘eh?’ at the end of a sentence: ‘It’s hot, eh?’” Admittedly, the interjection is not in the DC ; moreover, there are no slips for eh? in the citation files of the Lexicographical Centre for Canadian English. This situation certainly indicates that the readers for the DC did not consider it a Canadianism: either that or they were unaware that eh? might be relevant to the collection. The second of these possibilities may be set aside, for eh? is, in fact, entered in the Intermediate Dictionary and the Senior Dictionary , general dictionaries of English published in Canada for Canadians as part of the Dictionary of Canadian English series, to which the DC belongs. It should be added that eh? is also entered in every general dictionary of English, both British and American, on my shelves—a very considerable collection indeed, and one which includes the Oxford English Dictionary and Webster’s New International Dictionary (Third Edition).']",1,0

Unfortunately, a rigorous application of the standards listed by Thomason (2001), which he endorses, is detrimental to his argumentation based on the Tamil accusative. Smith furthermore argues that phonological and syntactic influence should go together. This is intended to discredit Sinhala influence, but closer scrutiny of the argument shows that it actually discredits Tamil influence. Smith’s papers furthermore are not informed by the socio-historical data and analysis presented in Nordhoff (2009), which are not compatible with his approach. Furthermore, Smith lists a phonological analysis based on syllable weight as a desideratum; such an analysis is also already found in Nordhoff 2009 and should have been consulted.']",1,0

In Maputo, most people speak one or more African languages and many do not speak the official language, Portuguese, fluently. Moreover, a complex justice environment in Maputo incorporates customary law such as community-based mediation. This article examines justice and civil society stakeholder attitudes towards the role of language in the justice system. Interviews with staff from ten agencies indicate that stakeholders recognise the positive value for victim- survivors of domestic violence to tell their story in their own language. However, stakeholder agencies sometimes act as “linguistic gate-keepers” and the authors conclude that a suitable first step in improving the state’s response to domestic violence is the development of tools to support agency staff at all levels in explaining legal terminology and processes in simple Portuguese, or local language translations.']",1,0

Often only very few, dominant official or national languages are utilised for health crisis communication despite existing work and research showing the need for inclusive health communication beyond such policies. Therefore, in response to the ongoing concern for effective multilingual communication policy amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, we explore culturally and linguistically responsive communication on social media in Victoria and the Northern Territory, Australia. Here, we suggest that multimodal information drawing on a broader range of semiotic resources delivered by community members has the potential to reconfigure state-level language policy and reflect regional socio-cultural situations. As such, several recommendations are made for adapting language policies including broader definitions of qualified translators and interpreters and the development of crisis-specific communication guidelines sensitive to the place of creation and its linguistic and socio-cultural demographics. Such inclusive, bottom-up approaches can inform other multilingual contexts and policies catering to highly diverse populations such as many European countries, the United States and South Africa, among others.']",1,0

The error pattern in the acquisition of certain ‘subject-equi’ verbs in Korean poses problems both for LEG and GB accounts of the constituent structure of infinitival complements and the acquisition of those constructions.

"[""This section investigates the syntactic licensing conditions for GoN and offers a (partial) solution. The discussion is necessarily brief and somewhat simplified. In a derivational model of syntax such as Chomsky's Minimalism, two questions need to be addressed to gain a minimal understanding of any process: (i) When does it happen? and (ii) What are its locality conditions? These questions are addressed for GoN in the following two subsections. The question of timing turns out to be crucial to the account of EN developed in section 4 of the paper. The question concerning locality turns out to be less central for EN. I try to unify the locality condition regulating GoN with Relativized Minimality (Rizzi 1990). (30) I will simply leave aside certain other important questions concerning GoN. For example, I have nothing new to say about the optionality of GoN (for which see Bailyn 1995, 1997 and references cited there). I also have little to add to the debate about the function of GoN as a semantic marker (see Babby 1980; Bailyn 1995, 1997; Borschev and Partee 1998; Brown 1999b; Partee and Borschev 2000, 2001, 2002 and the many references cited there). 3.1 Locality Following work by Franks (1995) and Neidle (1988), I assume that the following generalization is essentially correct. GoN is licensed with clause-mate negation (39); it is licensed in the complement of subject control verbs (40, 41); it is not licensed long distance in embedded non-finite interrogatives (42), in finite clauses (43), or in the complement of object control verbs (44).

(44) *Ja ne ugovorila Natasu citat' knig. I NEG persuaded [Natasa.sub.ACC] to-read [books.sub.GoN] intended: 'I didn't persuade Natasha to read books.' An additional generalization, mentioned in section 1, is that only underlying internal arguments can ever appear in the genitive of negation (4). Only one instance of GoN is licensed per negation (45) (see Brown and Franks (1995) from where the example is taken). (32,33) Finally, GoN and structural accusative are never both licensed by the same verbal predicate (46, 47). GoN and structural accusative are in complementary distribution: if GoN is assigned by a verbal predicate, then structural accusative is not, and if structural accusative is assigned by a verbal predicate, then GoN is not.

[Sveta.sub.ACC] NEG read [journal.sub.GON] intended: 'Sveta doesn't read a/the journal.' I account for the fact that no verb ever assigns GoN and accusative in the same clause by assuming (following Brown and Franks 1995: 247) that GoN and accusative are assigned from the same position. …""]",1,0

"[""TENSE VARIATION IN NARRATIVE Deborah Schiffrin University ofPennsylvania The narrative is a naturally bound unit ofdiscourse in which both formal and functional aspects of grammatical variation can be examined in a controlled and systematic way. This paper is a quantitative analysis of the past and the historical-present tenses as alternative ways of referring to past events in narrative. It shows how the organization of narrative delimits the area in which the historical present can occur, and how various structural and functional constraints restrict (or favor) switching between the two tenses. It also shows that the historical present evaluates narrative events because it is a use of the present tense, and that switching out of the historical present separates narrative events from each other.* The oral narrative is an ideal site for the quantitative study of variation in discourse ; because it is a naturally bound unit of discourse with a regular internal structure, both formal and functional aspects of variation can be examined in a controlled and systematic way. However, despite much recent work on how narratives are constructed and performed (e.g. Bennett 1977, Knapp 1976, Labov 1972, Polanyi 1979), there has been little use of quantitative methods in the analysis of grammatical variation within narrative. Thus we have, on the one hand, a well-developed methodology for analysing linguistic variation, and, on the other hand, a rich body of qualitative descriptions of narrative, but few studies which utilize the advantages of both approaches. This paper examines tense variation in narrative. The historical-present tense—the use of the present tense to refer to past events—alternates with the past tense in narrative. In the following fragment of narrative, events are understood as having occurred prior to the moment of speaking, regardless of the tense of the verb:1 * I am indebted to Anthony Kroch and William Labov for helpful comments on and criticisms of earlier drafts of this paper. Anne Bower, John Fought, Phyllis Nudelman, Ellen Prince, and Louis Scavo have also provided useful suggestions. An earlier and shorter version, using slightly different data, was presented at the 1978 LSA Annual Meeting, Boston. ' Narratives used in this study were primarily from sociolinguistic interviews conducted by members of a research project studying language change and variation in the Philadelphia speech community (NSF-75-00245, Principal Investigator: William Labov), and to a lesser extent from data collected by members of the Linguistics 560 class in 1976 and 1977. I thank everyone for allowing me access to their narratives. Special thanks go to Anne Bower, whose own interest in narratives no doubt contributed to her success in eliciting them—and, ofcourse, to William Labov, whose systematic collection of narratives made the job of looking for the HP much easier. Note that Wolfson 1976, 1978 has argued that narratives told during sociolinguistic interviews are not likely to contain the HP—that it is more likely when speaker and hearer share norms of interpretation and evaluation. As Anthony Kroch has suggested (p.c.), increased use of the HP in interview narratives can thus be seen as an indication ofbetter fieldwork methods, with interviews becoming more like natural conversational situations. For descriptions of sociolinguistic fieldwork methods in general, and of methods used in the Philadelphia project, see Labov et al. 1979. In all examples of excerpts from narratives, only clauses which represent narrative events (clauses in the complicating action section) are lettered. Each line of transcript with a letter preceding it contains one complicating action clause, and the letter indicates only the clause on that 45 46LANGUAGE, VOLUME 57, NUMBER 1 (1981) (1) a.

Les résultats de l’analyse thématique à laquelle l’auteure soumet ces données révèlent que, dans les espaces d’apprentissage interstitiel, les élèves prennent part à des activités d’alphabétisation qui englobent le brassage d’idées issues de YouTube et de joutes rap, dont les conventions sociales diffèrent. Le fait de mieux comprendre ces activités d’alphabétisation devrait, selon l’auteure, avoir des répercussions sur l’efficacité des méthodes pédagogiques des enseignants.']",1,0

['Claire Blanche-Benveniste : « De quelques débats sur le rôle de la langue parlée dans les évolutions diachroniques » This paper discusses some widespread arguments about the influence exerted by spoken French on the diachronic general evolution of French syntax. The focus is put on four main topics : the search for first attested instances of syntactic « errors » in spoken French ; the impact of young generations « errors » ; différents ways of counting syntactic features involved in those errors ; the relations between such « errors » and some of the general syntactic evolutions of French language that can be listed during XXth century. The conclusion would be that spoken language is less influencial on the general evolution than usually asserted.'],1,0

"['In Old Norwegian (ON), 1st and 2nd person null subjects (1/2 NS) are much rarer than 3rd person null subjects (3 NS). It has been suggested in recent work that 1/2 NS are ungrammatical and in fact do not exist in ON. According to this view, only 3rd person pronouns can be null subjects, because only they are not DPs (determiner phrases). For this latter claim to be true, ON cannot have preproprial articles, as this would indicate that 3rd person pronouns are DPs. This article presents ON data to demonstrate that the language has both 1/2 NS and preproprial articles. Since all ON personal pronouns appear to be DPs, there is little support for the purported difference in syntactic structure; thus, the observed asymmetry between 1/2 NS and 3 NS must have other, possibly extra-grammatical, causes.']",1,0

"['In 1820, the Cape of Good Hope, a British colony since 1795, became the new home to c. 4,500 English-speaking settlers. Correspondence surviving from this period in reference to this settlement enables insights into early nineteenth century letters, a still understudied area. Moreover, it provides a good setting to disambiguate the term letter from an internal, bottom-up perspective. Such a perspective may offer ""a key for disclosing historical forms of communication"" (Hübler and Busse 2012: 1) as first-order phenomena. This is achieved in an analysis of categorial labels (keywords) and metacommunicative clues found in the internal correspondence of the Colonial Office, a British government department, in the years 1820-1821. The results of the analysis provide a partial answer to what the label letter meant for this professional community. Adding a researcher’s perspective to such a description allows proposing a twofold approach to ""the letter"" as an analytic category in the study of historical correspondence.']",1,0

"['Letter from the Editor David F. Armstrong This issue of Sign Language Studies begins with two articles commemorating the ninetieth anniversary (July 21, 2009) of the birth of William C. Stokoe, the journal’s founder, and the tenth anniversary of his passing (April 4, 2010). The articles are reprinted from The Study of Signed Languages, a volume of essays produced in celebration of his eightieth birthday. These articles are followed by a commentary piece concerning interpretations (and misinterpretations) of Bill’s seminal concept, “semantic phonology.” Next are two articles that deal with one of the principal preoccupations of his life’s work—the possible impact of signed languages on the education of deaf children. Fittingly, these articles describe educational programs in two widely separated parts of the world: the United States and Argentina. The first article, by Cynthia Bailes and her colleagues, draws quite literally on Bill’s legacy—its preparation was supported by income from a generous gift of an endowment to Gallaudet University, which he made just before his death. (Those wishing to support the William C. Stokoe Jr. Chair of Ethnographic Studies in Deaf Language and Culture should contact the Gallaudet Development Office.) The issue ends with a review of a book that might seem, at first glance, like an odd choice for this journal. It was chosen for two reasons: It gives a slight nod in the direction of Bill’s early career as a scholar of English literature, and it deals with an important discussion, however flawed, of the underlying role of vision and visual representation in the development of human language and poetry. We believe that those familiar with the body of Stokoe’s work will see the connection. More generally, we hope that readers will find this issue a fitting tribute to a most distinguished and influential human being. [End Page 388] Copyright © 2009 Gallaudet University']",1,0

"['Abstract This study explored the effect of extending the duration of the syllable formant transition on auditory habituation in full-term and preterm infants at 12 months, as measured by decreases in amplitude for syllable repetition using EEG time–frequency analyses. EEG recordings for four repetitions of the syllable (/ta/) under two different conditions (non-modified and modified) were collected for one group of 13 full-term and two groups of preterm infants differing in language production performance; 15 infants had high scores (HS), and 14 had low scores (LS). Full-term and HS preterm infants showed significant decreases in amplitude for syllable repetition in both conditions. LS preterm infants showed a decrease only in the modified syllable condition, suggesting a facilitation effect of modified syllables in the LS preterm group.']",1,0

Zheng-Zhang Shangfang, Zheng-Zhang, or Zheng-Zhang Xiansheng, to his colleagues, friends, and students, was born on August 9, 1933 in Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province, China. He was a self-taught linguist. He did not attend university and did not receive any formal linguistics training. Living in China during the 1950s and 1960s, being without a university degree meant that he had to find all linguistics books and learn all his linguistic knowledge by himself. In order to have access to a collection of linguistics books, he worked in a local library for five years, starting as a volunteer. He would jokingly say that he graduated from “University of Wenzhou Library”. With the help of his friend Pan Wuyun and others he hand-copied many thick reference books, such as the Chinese translation of Karlgren’s Études sur la phonologie chinoise and Shen Jianshi’s Guangyun Shengxi, both which he borrowed from fellow scholars who supported him. Aided with his incredible knowledge of traditional documents and his unyielding passion for Chinese linguistics, he excelled in all the linguistic fields he studied. His knowledge, his academic curiosity, his passion, his devotion, and his creativity were all exceptional. The combination of these qualities made Zheng-Zhang a unique scholar. To many, he was a miracle and a genius in Chinese linguistics.']",1,0

Other verbal metaphor vehicles work much more specifically, as posited by discourse dynamics theory, metaphorizing contextually distinct aspects of living with violence.

"['This paper explores the language used by Australian Football League (AFL) footballers and Australian Broadcast Corporation (ABC) journalists in their post-match interviews broadcast on ABC (774 Melbourne) radio. From Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL), Appraisal is used to investigate the evaluative language expressed by the AFL footballers in their exchanges with ABC journalists. Despite the many applications of linguistics to media discourse, especially within SFL, this research is the first to analyse the language of Australian athletes in their post-match interviews. It is found that irrespective of the result of the game, ABC journalists and AFL footballers maintain a neutral stance by countering expressions of positive Attitude with negative Attitude, as well as employing Graduation and Engagement resources that reduce authorial endorsement. These findings are summarized and discussed, including reference to neutralism from Conversation Analysis. The paper goes on to claim that the tenor between AFL footballers, ABC journalists and the broadcast audience makes it difficult for AFL footballers to express authoritative evaluations. The ultimate aim is to show that AFL footballers do well to negotiate a particularly challenging register.']",1,0

Wang (Wang Shiyuan 王士元）of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) as the honorary chairman of the conference, gave a keynote speech on “Language and cognition across the health-span”. The focus was a consideration of the significant association between the development of the brain and the development of child language, as well as the recession of language and cognition in the sunset of life. He started by reviewing the evolution of the human body: compared to chimpanzees, human infants develop much more complex cognitive processes, such as discriminating phonetic contrasts, likely as a result partly of their significantly larger brain volume. It is noteworthy that language acquisition happens when the infant’s brain weight approaches that of adults. In contrast, there is a decline of brain function in the elderly, associated with structural changes such as the shrinkage of hippocampus. It has been hypothesized that older adults might recruit cognitive resources at lower loads to compensate for cognitive decline. It is important to pay more attention to the neuro-degeneration in the elderly and there is an urgent need for us to come up with better diagnoses and treatments for the senior population with neuropsychiatric disorder. Peng Gang 彭剛 also from PolyU presented the keynote speech “Brain plasticity reflected by using linguistic tones.” He pointed out that the brain has amazing ability to reorganize itself by forming new connections between neurons throughout an individual’s life course. It is necessary to note that different languages shape different brains and different brains produce different perceptions. What is more, different perceptions would produce different behaviors and different behaviors then characterize different languages, which form the triangle model discussed by William S-Y. Wang (2009).3 3. William S-Y.

"['Abstract This paper seeks to show how language, combined with other social variables, exacerbates migrants’ and their descendants’ struggles at school and beyond in Luxembourg. To a certain extent, the official trilingualism of Luxembourg – French, German and Luxembourgish – corresponds to an ‘elite multilingualism’ (Garrido 2017; Barakos and Selleck 2018) which defines who can access certain resources, e. g. education, work etc., and who can be left playing catch-up. The latter are those migrants who I here conceive as multilinguals on the margins . The elitist system is a form of domination and power over those whose language repertoire is less valued. Migrants’ disadvantage is further impacted by other indicators of their identity that can go beyond their educational qualifications and language repertoire per se , such as their country of origin, ethnicity, race, gender, citizenship etc. Language intersects with other forms of disadvantage or privileges. From an ethnographic sociolinguistic perspective, drawing on interviews and participant observations, this paper will illustrate this intersection of language, race and ethnicity, and struggles from the ground-level educational realities and aspirations of Cape Verdean migrants and their descendants in Luxembourg. This helps cast light on the social organisation in Luxembourg and understand the effects of multilingualism in creating ‘abyssal lines’ (Santos 2007) between the nationals, certain European migrants, Lusophone and African migrants in terms of social and economic mobility.']",1,0

There are 18 themes identified in the Index to the first 60 issues, published in ET 61. Take a look at them in the panel.

"['Basics of the South Sudanese Deaf Community and the Sign Language Eyasu Hailu (bio) and Sophia Mohammed (bio) To date, there has not been any research conducted on the South Sudanese Deaf community and South Sudanese Sign Language (SSSL). This article presents an introductory note about both with information gained from personal observations of the authors and from online resources. It provides an insight for furthering extensive research on the newest nation\'s sign language and the Deaf community. The South Sudanese Deaf Community South Sudan is an East Central African nation (see figure 1) that seceded from North Sudan in 2011. According to the World Population Review, the population size of South Sudan is about 11.19 million. South Sudan is a newly established nation, and Christianity is the largest religion. There are about sixty-two ethnic groups. The official language of South Sudan is English. As per the database on www.peoplegroups.org, the Deaf South Sudanese population totals about 215,000, with the majority living in the rural area. Juba is the capital city, where there are a relatively greater number of Deaf people than in other cities. [End Page 245] Click for larger view View full resolution Figure 1. Map of South Sudan. Data about the Deaf community in South Sudan is mostly available within the ""disability"" category. According to the Coalition of Organization of Persons with Disabilities (2016), there are two Deaf associations in South Sudan: the Equatoria States Association of the Deaf and Dumb (ESADD) and the South Sudan National Association of the Deaf. The report mentions that the highest level of education attained by its members is a secondary school education. Few Deaf people are university graduates with the opportunity they gained from abroad, such as in Kenya, Uganda, and North Sudan, before independence. Those who got access to education secured professional jobs at government offices and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). However, most of the Deaf people in the capital are engaged in physical labor, trade, and other private businesses, such as car washing and hair braiding. Currently, the majority of South Sudanese Sign Language (SSSL) signers reside in the capital Juba, though their exact numbers are not known. One of the social gathering places is at the lone Deaf church [End Page 246] in the capital. The other meeting places for the Deaf community are in cafés along the shore of the White Nile. SSSL Signers Like most African sign languages, SSSL is an emerging sign language that is named after the formation of South Sudan in 2011. This probably labels it as the world\'s youngest sign language. Before 2011, it was called Sudanese Sign Language. The SSSL signers in Juba have frequent language contact with Kenyan and Ugandan signers. For crosscultural communication, they also use American Sign Language (ASL). ASL fingerspelling is used to teach and learn SSSL. This is reflected in the production of the national SSSL dictionary, published in 2016. Names of the months and days of the week show variations. Signers have said that some signs are from Kenya, some are from Uganda, and some others are from North Sudan. In fact, there are also indigenous signs observed in daily communications. More detailed analysis needs to be done to identify other areas of variations. As can be seen in the figures, the names of months and days of the week are entirely different in the two dictionaries. Examples are in figures 2 and 3, compared with their corresponding figures 4 and 5. Similarly, figures 6 and 7 are entirely different from their corresponding Click for larger view View full resolution Figure 2. monday (ESAD, 2010).

"['This paper deals with graphophonematic and onomastic problems arising from two early English runic inscriptions. Since Pre-OE /ā̆/ and /ɔ̄̆/ were apparently graphemicized as ᚪ a2 and ᚩ a3 at (about) the same time during the late fifth century, it is possible to identify rune no. 6 \ue0ac on the Loveden Hill urn as a variant of the āc -rune ᚪ, \ue0aa (~ \ue0ab). Thus, the initial runic sequence there, sïþa1ba2d, renders a correctly shaped male name Pre-OE Sīþæbad (= WFranc./Hispano-Goth. Sendebadus ). The Watchfield case fitting is at least 50 years younger, and the first part of its inscription, ha1riboki, may have undergone sub-phonemic umlaut (/hæribōki/ phonetically [ˈhærɪˌboːcɪ] or [ˈhεrɪˌbøːcɪ]?).

Some differences appear essentially concerning the formalisation of the theory and the subjacent conception of the grammar.

It underlines the relationship between language and society, specific to Functionalism.']",1,0

"[""Introduction to American Deaf Culture, by Thomas K. Holcomb (New York: Oxford University Press, 2013, 386 pp., paperback, $49.99, ISBN-13: 9780199777549)IN FIFTEEN CHAPTERS comprising 386 pages, the author, Thomas K. Holcomb, presents a comprehensive exploration of American Deaf culture. The introductory chapter provides an overview of the book, includes a summary of the authors credentials, and explains how he strives to portray a balanced perspective of the diverse constituencies of the Deaf community.Chapter 2 addresses the crux of this book: the definition of culture and how it applies to Deaf people and their community. The author emphasizes the relationship between culture and language, and what he has to say could not be more true for Deaf people and their signed languages. Holcomb delves further into his topic by comparing and contrasting American culture, more specifically, middle-class, white, hearing Americans, with Deaf American culture. This juxtaposition of cultures is beneficial in particular for people familiar with one or the other, as Holcomb shares specific characteristics of American culture, such as individualism and independence, which are in stark contrast to Deaf American culture, with its emphasis on collectivism and interdependence.The third chapter explores demographic data, deaf people's backgrounds and experiences, membership in the community, and labels used to describe Deaf and hearing people, including the disability label, which is often erroneously attributed to Deaf people and their culture; it closes with a proposal to describe Deaf people and Deaf culture as a linguistic minority. Chapter 4 focuses on the journey of cultural awareness, which comprises several stages on the way to achieving a positive sense of self and Deaf identity. Chapters 5 and 6 explore early definitions of Deaf culture and current attempts to reffame it as the Deaf experience based on values stemming from a visual orientation.Chapter 7 focuses on American Sign Language (ASL), clarifying misconceptions and presenting linguistic information about focal ASL vocabulary, which is strongly associated with cultural values. For instance, ASL has only one sign for music, song, sing, and concert-yet more than a dozen signs for different types of deaf and hearing people. Bilingualism and the history of ASL are briefly touched upon, including prescriptive and descriptive perspectives of the language.Literature and the arts, pivotal areas of cultural awareness, as well as appreciation of and expression by Deaf people are covered in chapters 8 and 9. Literature of the Deaf community comes in many forms, including written English literature and signed ASL literature. Holcomb mentions periodicals, books, autobiographies, and specialinterest books that discuss specific themes and/or experiences such as being black and Deaf, Deaf gay and lesbian, Deaf Native American, and more. Deaf art, called De'VIA (DeafView/Image Art), tends to fell into two categories: resistance art and affirmation art, The book displays more than twenty such images. In addition, the book's valuable companion website, www.americandeafculture.com, has links to more than ten videos that the author himself signs, expanding on the information discussed in the book. For example, Holcomb demonstrates signs, linguistic information, and poetry that he himself has produced and also shares (with their permission) classic and contemporary literature by other Deaf artists and performers.Representing a departure from analyzing culture and language, chapter 10 focuses on culturally acceptable behavior within the Deaf community. Leave taking, persistence in contact, letting others know of your destination, reporting back, detailed introductions, and name signs are examples of unique cultural behaviors associated with Deaf people and Deaf culture. Holcomb does not stop here but ventures in more unfamiliar territory, discussing unwritten rules when it comes to qualifying for board positions or athletic events designed for Deaf people (and not for deaf people? …""]",1,0

In particular, the argumentative monologue given by Joseph Ratzinger as Pope Benedict XVI during his 2011 visit to the federal parliament in the Reichstag in Berlin will be used as a case study. In his speech, Ratzinger offers his reflections on the foundations of law starting from his interpretation of a brief story from the First Book of the Kings in the Old Testament ( 1 Kings 3:5–10). The entire interpretation assumes the form of an argumentative text, in which he appeals to an authoritative voice of German-language jurisprudence (Hans Kelsen) and three Christian religious authorities (St Augustine, Origen of Alexandria, and St Paul). The aim of the study is to assess the pragmatic strength of Ratzinger’s argumentation and thus verify the authoritative contribution of religious experts in his argumentation, in which religion and ethics are linked together.']",1,0

Specific innovations made by the UHM Korean Language Flagship Center, in cooperation with the UHM Department of East Asian Languages and Literatures, include (a) introduction of Flagship degree programs, (b) program revamping to accommodate superior-level language and culture training, (c) intensive and innovative instructions, (d) overseas immersion training, (e) content-based, domain-based instruction, and (f) outreach to precollege students. In addition, the paper points out what kinds of further innovations are awaiting to be made, what kinds of challenges are ahead for the Korean Flagship programs and how such challenges may be resolved in the near future. Finally, the paper concludes that the Flagship model can be adapted or customized to other advanced Korean language courses and programs and thus it has a high potential for applicability in other college setting.']",1,0

"[""WHEN Uncle Tom's Cabin was written in 1851-52, Harriet Beecher Stowe possessed a certain amount of first-hand information concerning the negro race. As a child, she had heard in prayers and sermons many references to the slave, but not until the Beecher family reached Cincinnati in 1832 did she see negroes in any considerable number. In 1833 came her memorable visit to a plantation in Kentucky and her first contact with southern slaves on their own soil. By 1836 Dr. Beecher's Seminary near Cincinnati became a center of abolitionist activity; and Harriet presumably saw much of negro life. In 1839, for example, the family aided a Kentucky negress to escape from her former master-an episode from which, it will be remembered, Mrs. Stowe later elaborated the escape of Eliza. Thus, when the novelist left Ohio in 1850, she had been afforded considerable opportunity for casual observation of the negro and his master, but not for elaborate or detailed study. Turning to Uncle Tom's Cabin, the reader observes at once that the speech of Mrs. Stowe's slaves closely resembles that of her lower-class whites, particularly her Ohio River folk. The basis of the dialects of whites and blacks alike is laid in the following violations of standard speech: agreement of subjects and predicates is ignored (I hates, they gets); pronouns are corrupted (un, yer, yourn); double negatives appear; initial syllables are dropped ('cause, 'pears); final consonants are sometimes clipped and -ng changed to -n (durs', schreechin'); words are shortened internally (al'ays, gen'l, mis'able, shif'less); and a long series of barbarisms is introduced (as arter, afeard, consarned, critters, gal, hant, jest, kinder, sartin, shet, tate, warn't). Thus the foundation of the speech of all of Mrs. Stowe's characters is the dialect, not exactly of the New Englanders of fiction as is suggested by Krapp (The English Language in America, I, 262), but the common body of folk-speech which underlies American dialects in all sections of the country. The chief weakness in Mrs. Stowe's recording of these peculiarities in the speech of both races is her persistent inconsistency: verbs agree with their nouns on one page and disagree on the next; present participles end in -in in one paragraph and in -ing in another; jest becomes just, yer becomes you, and the like. 322""]",1,0

"['nESEARCH IN PRESENT-DAY English, as all who are interested in the field are aware, is vigorous and profitable. Dialectology, the subdivision of the field that comes first to mind, is represented happily by continuing work on the Linguistic Atlas. Funds for the completion of field work in New York State by Raven I. McDavid have been secured, and further work in the Middle West is being carried on by Harold B. Allen, Albert H. Marckwardt, and others. Also, active investigation of foreign language areas is going on under the direction of workers such as Einar Haugen in the Scandinavian field and Ernest F. Haden in French. Although the Stlas has published only its New England materials, its records for the Middle and South Atlantic states are complete and are available for investigators. These records have given rise to numerous articles and monographs, among which are, to mention only a few, two doctoral dissertations on New York City speechl and the forthcoming monographs on dialect words and on popular verbal inflections by Hans Kurath, Director of the Atlas, and by E. Bagby Atwood. I cannot, of course, make a complete summary of the results of Atlas investigation, but two ways in which these results have modified previously held opinions about American English can be mentioned. The first of these is that the generally accepted division of American dialects into New England, Southern, and General American is in need of modification, since it is now evident that the division is into three bands, Northern, Midland, and Southern, with the areas of Pennsylvania and New Jersey falling in with Midland, as do']",1,0

But do some of these feelings of insecurity still exist today? According to the authors of the OGPL, many of the tensions remain between what they refer to as lexicographic ‘theory’ and ‘practice’, which is why I had great difficulties reading their introductory chapter. On the very first page, Atkins and Rundell deprecate metalexicography as the province concerned merely with talking ‘about dictionaries’, although they acknowledge the names of some scholars who have done this well; on page 4 they deny the existence of theoretical lexicography while at the same time giving examples of some linguists whose ideas have brought useful innovations to lexicography; and at the end of Chapter 1, they ridicule the tensions between (linguistic) theory and (lexicographic) practice by means of a rather obscure envoi.']",1,0

"['Abstract C. S. Peirce’s concept of virtual habit, especially articulated in his later manuscripts, renovates his earlier notion of how explanatory rationality operates to form sound inferences, reinforcing his commitment to a genuinely pragmaticistic worldview. Virtual habit represents Peirce’s clearest directive of how to guess right. Pictures in the mind (unbidden/constructed) promote new modes of consciousness that, in turn, impel the kind of inferences which surface in recommendations for courses of action – Peirce’s most influential kind of abduction (1909: MS 637). Virtual habits transcend subjective perspectives about which factors contribute to outcomes as well as incorporate which who, where, and when controls the ultimate consequence. Virtual habits serve as windows illustrating how imaged events preempt the adoption of new belief structures/action plans that afford the more plausible recourses to resolve anomalous consequences. Virtual habits propose imminent action plans (']",1,0

I argue that these asymmetries are best explained by the mechanism of late merge of adjuncts proposed by Lebeaux (1988) with a derivational definition of c-command à la Epstein (1999). Furthermore, I argue that the timing of late merge of adjuncts is regulated by phase theory in the way that adjuncts may be merged no later than completion of relevant operations at the phase domains they belong to.']",1,0

Alors que sa distinction entre bilinguisme et bilingualité (Hamers et Blanc, 1995, 2000) est utile dans les domaines de l'acquisition des langues secondes et du bilinguisme, son utilisation de ces termes dans des situations impliquant plus de deux langues est discutable. Cet article décrit certains aspects des dimensions psychologiques de la bilingualité qui font que le plurilinguisme soit différent du bilinguisme. En exposant les différents facteurs impliqués dans une situation multilingue et en proposant une typologie du plurilinguisme, nous mettons en évidence l'importance de voir le plurilinguisme dans une perspective holistique et de voir l'individu plurilingue en tant que système psycholinguistique complexe.

A development of the opening address given at a conference on the teaching of grammar at the Regional Language Centre (RELC) in Singapore in November 2003. The key issue of the conference was whether the English-language skills of Singaporean school leavers would be improved through a revival of explicit and formal grammar teaching in the Lion City's 21st-century classrooms. The paper addresses this issue in both current and historical terms, going back indeed, at the end, to the beginnings of Western-style grammar teaching among the Greeks.

Les résultats de cette étude ont donc de nombreuses implications qui touchent tant à la didactique des sciences en immersion qu'à la formation à l'enseignement des matière en langue seconde.""]",1,0

"['Abstract Informed by image repair theory, this study examines grammatical resources used to represent agents of retraction-engendering acts in retraction notices (RNs). A corpus of 250 RNs from two broad disciplinary groupings and authored by different stakeholders was analyzed to determine if agents of retraction-engendering acts were identified and how linguistically visible they were made. It was found that agents of culpable acts were identified in only 44.40% of the RNs and that agent-obscuring grammatical resources were deployed about 3.35 times more frequently than agent-identifying ones were. Furthermore, the hard-discipline RNs authored by journal authorities identified agents of culpable acts significantly less frequently and less explicitly than both the hard-discipline RNs from authors of retracted publications and the soft-discipline RNs written by journal authorities did. These results suggest that choices of grammatical resources in RNs are influenced by a complex web of factors, including different retraction stakeholders’ varied communicative purposes, their image repair efforts, their relation to the reprehensible acts, and legal considerations. These findings warrant further attention to language use in RNs as a high-stakes genre.']",1,0

Viewed from the ground up, this picture of early childhood education as a path to bright futures for all children is often belied by political and economic entrenchments. This article draws on a four-year ethnographic study of multiple classrooms in one Lebanese public kindergarten school that serves the most vulnerable children in Lebanon – Lebanese, Syrian, and Palestinian children who face daily the insecurities of poverty, displacement, and political violence. Drawing on anthropological theory that illustrates how social identities forged at the level of historical timescales are constructed and contested at the microlevel of everyday life, we pay particular attention to spatio-temporal liminal contexts within which children renounce productions of their own, their peers’, and their families’ marginality.']",1,0

"['Adults demonstrate difficulty and pronounced variability when developing second language (L2) grammatical knowledge and reading skills. We examine explanations in terms of individual differences in working memory (WM). Despite numerous studies, the association between WM and adult second language (L2) acquisition remains unclear, and longitudinal studies are scarce and contradictory. This study investigates whether WM affects L2 grammar and reading development in beginning classroom learners, using WM tests with (Waters and Caplan’s 1996 test) and without (Daneman and Carpenter’s 1980 test) a demanding processing task. In Experiment 1, 82 beginning first language (L1) English learners of Spanish completed Daneman and Carpenter’s test, and grammar and reading pretests and posttests one year apart. In Experiment 2, 330 beginning English learners of Spanish completed the same tests as in Experiment 1 and Waters and Caplan’s test. The results reveal that only Waters Caplan’s test (response time, recall span) yielded WM effects, and that response time (processing) negatively correlated with recall span (storage). These findings reveal longitudinal WM effects on L2 grammar and reading development at early acquisition stages, support resource-sharing WM models, and urge scholars to adopt WM tests with a processing task performed under timed conditions, and to analyse response time.']",1,0

In this article, we describe the different structures of these visual synthesizers. The techniques used include key-frame approaches based on 24 lip/chin images carefully selected to account for most of the basic coarticulated shapes in French, 2D parametric models of the lip contours, and finally 3D parametric models of the main components of the face. The successive versions were systematically evaluated, with the same reference corpus, according to a standard procedure. Auditory intelligibility and audio-visual intelligibility were compared under several conditions of acoustic distortion to evaluate the benefit of speechreading. Tests were run with acoustic material produced by a text-to-speech synthesizer or by a reference human speaker. Our results show that while visual speech is unnecessary under clear acoustic conditions, it adds intelligibility to the auditory information when the acoustics are degraded. Furthermore, the intelligibility provided by the visual channel increased constantly through successive improvements of our text-to-visual speech synthesizers.']",1,0

"['Most research studies of news assume a bias toward the extreme, the unusual, and the new. However, much of the content of newspapers consists of the routine and the predictable. Using a collection of articles from the New York Times sampled from 1852 to the present, this paper examines news about one subject, national holidays, with a view to explaining the pragmatic functions of such formally unnewsworthy articles. In the national holiday news cycle, the newspaper first announces or forecasts the observances, and after they have taken place the public response is evaluated for enthusiasm and decorum. The standard of behaviour is reinforced through small human interest stories that contain inferential gaps encouraging readers to draw on their knowledge of human conduct. The basic principle being inferred is politeness toward the nation, in the sense of respecting its positive face by anticipating and following its wishes, and respecting its negative face by avoiding challenges and focusing on citizen responsibilities rather than citizen rights. The result is news stories that violate some of the most important \x93hard\x94 news values previously identified by researchers, by being predictable, ambiguous, static, and generally \x93good news\x94. The analysis also shows how news which is apparently free of conflict can prepare readers for future consumption of conflict-oriented news.']",1,0

"['This paper offers basic observations about wh-questions in JSL with clause-final wh-signs, i.e., wh-finals. Basic word order of matrix wh-sentences in Japanese Sign Language (JSL) have been reported by previous studies such as Morgan (2006), Fischer and Gong (2010), Kimura (2011), and Akahori and Oka (2011), among others, which reported that wh-signs can appear in the clause-final position in addition to clause-initial and in-situ positions. In order to investigate the syntactic mechanism of JSL wh-constructions, it is also necessary to confirm basic syntactic properties of wh-signs in embedded clauses. However, distributions of wh-signs in embedded clauses have not been fully investigated in previous studies. Based on the discussion on the word order of sentences with direct and indirect speech in JSL in Uchibori et al. (2011), this paper demonstrates that wh-signs occur in embedded clauses that are not instances of direct speech (or quotations) of wh-questions, but those of syntactically embedded indirect speech. In embedded clauses, wh-finals appear as in the matrix wh-questions. Relevant theoretical issues are discussed concerning the relation between linear properties (i.e., distributions of wh-expressions) and the structural properties of natural language.']",1,0

It reports on main theoretical and methodological approaches to critical analysis of political discourse. Mainly, it deals with theoretical and methodological perspectives of three leading schools of critical discourse analysis: discourse analysis of N. Fairclough, that presents a relational approach to considering social problems in their relation to textual analysis; socio-cognitive theory of T.A. van Dijk, oriented to investigating relations between cognitive structures, discourse and social coordination; discourse analysis of R. Wodak, that uses historical approach to discourse and is aimed at description of powerful language of the elite that helps to maintain dominance in society. The paper characterizes some frameworks of critical analysis of political discourse, including the Duisburg School of Critical Discourse Analysis (S. Jäger, F. Maier), System-Functional and Social-Semiotic Theory (M. Halliday, T. van Leeuwen), and Mediated Discourse Analysis (R. Scollon, S. Scollon). It is stated that within its boundaries critical discourse analysis includes a variety of approaches, analytical tools and methodologies. The author underlines that scientific consideration of critical discourse analysis will demonstrate its potential and prospects for integrating this interdisciplinary qualitative methodology into a set of empirical tools of modern political science.']",1,0

In a recent historical survey of work in morphology, Matthews claims that in the 1940s and early 1950s the question ‘What are the basic units of morphological structure, and what are the relations which obtain between them?’ received a comparatively simple answer, namely that the units were morphemes and the relation between them one of linear succession (1970: 97–98). This seems to me inaccurate in two respects. Firstly, some linguists (notably Harris) recognized ‘morphemic components’ as well as morphemes; secondly, and more generally, explicit provision was made (following Bloomfield) for a statement of the order of elements in a grammatical construction – and simple succession, with X preceding (or following) Y was not the only order relation recognized. Allowance was also made, implicitly or explicitly, for (a) simultaneity, with X and Y occurring at the same time; and (b) discontinuity, with Y interrupting X. It will be convenient to discuss morphemic components in the larger context of simultaneous ordering; I shall then return to discontinuity in 3.']",1,0

In this article some objective data will be presented on voice register and intonation in two dialects of Spanish, those of Madrid and Mexico City, as a first step in clarifying the use of these two subjective terms. The results of research presented here are based on tape-recorded interviews with native Spanish speakers and an electronic analysis of those recordings by the Léon-Martin pitch extractor at the University of Toronto.']",1,0

"['O português brasileiro é uma língua muito rica em variantes. Isso acontece em função da variação linguística que pode afetar qualquer aspecto linguístico, como os lexicais, sintáticos, fonético-fonológicos. Quando afeta esse último, pode originar uma alofonia. Nesse contexto, o objetivo geral deste trabalho é analisar o papel das consoantes nasais na ocorrência de alofonia, por meio do processo de posteriorização, no dialeto alagoano do português do Brasil. Para tanto, foram analisados outros contextos fonológicos, além da nasalização, a fim de saber se esses também propiciariam a substituição de [v], [z] e [ʒ] por [ɦ]; a ocorrência da posteriorização em outros pontos de articulação; e sua relação com os tipos de vogais, a composição da sílaba, a tonicidade da sílaba. Tendo isso em vista, a principal hipótese foi a de que, devido ao abaixamento do véu palatino durante a realização de segmentos nasais, as fricativas citadas sofrem glotalização por meio de um processo de coarticulação antecipatória (BARBOSA e MADUREIRA, 2015) ou de enfraquecimento (MARQUES, 2001). Assim, a composição do corpus se deu através da gravação de entrevistas com seis informantes, três do sexo masculino e três do sexo feminino, alagoanos e filhos de alagoanos, em diferentes faixas etárias. Posteriormente, foram feitas a segmentação e a transcrição das gravações e a análise dos dados com base em Barbosa e Madureira (2015), Silva (2003), Aragão et al (2013), Marques (2001) e Roncaratti e Uchoa (2014). Através dos resultados, constatou-se a maior ocorrência do fenômeno quando acompanhado de segmentos nasais tanto internos aos vocábulos quanto em ambientes sintático-fonológicos. Notou-se, ainda, que os tipos de sílabas, a distância acentual, os segmentos vocálicos e consonantais não nasais não exercem essa mesma influência. Por fim, este estudo alcança seu propósito de promover uma abertura para novos estudos nesse campo tão pouco estudado, comprovando a sua principal hipótese.']",1,0

One-formant stimuli with F ∗ = F1 and F ∗ = F2 , two-formant F 1, F 2 stimuli and stimuli with a jumping formant produced as trains of alternating F 1 - and F 2- pulses occurring on different proportions were used in vowel identification experiments. The response distributions corresponding to two-formant stimuli and to stimuli with a jumping formant were approximated as weighted sums of two ‘basic’ distribution. P 1 and P 2 , corresponding to one-formant stimuli. An increase in the proportion of F 2-pulses in stimuli with a jumping formant was accompanied by a systematic increase in the P 2 component in the response distribution. Stimuli with a jumping formant did not elicit the phonemic responses typical for two-formant stimuli with the same F 1 and F 2 frequencies. The data suggest that the running identification of the stimulus is integrated temporally. Der vorliegende Artikel behandelt das Problem der zeitlichen Integration der Information bei der Vokalperzeption sowie der Natur dieser Information. Stimuli aus einem Formanten (F ∗ = F1, F ∗ = F2) , zwei Formanten ( F 1, F 2) und springenden Formanten, der mit Hilfe von in unterschiedlichem Verhältnis alternierenden F 1- und F 2- Impulsen Formantenverläufe simuliert, wurden für Vokal-Indentifikationsexperimente verwendet. Die Verteilungen der Hörerurteile bezüglich der Stimuli mit zwei Formanten unde dem springenden Formanten konnten als gewichtete Summen zweier den Stimuli mit einem Formanten entsprechenden ‘Basis’-Verteilungen ( P 1 und P ) approximiert werden. Der Anstieg des Anteils von F 2-Impulsen in Stimuli mit springendem Formanten wurde begleitet von einer systematischen Zunahme der P 2-Komponente in den Urteilen. Die Stimuli mit springendem Formanten ergeben keinen Aufschluss über die phonemischen Hörer-Reaktionen, die für Zwei-Formanten-Stimuli derselben F 1- und F2-Frequenzen typisch sind. Die vorliegenden Daten unterstützen die These einer temporalen Integration der Ergebnisse aus der fortlaufenden Identifikation des Stimulus.

Les distributions de réponses correspondant aux stimuli à 2 formants et à ceux avec formant évolutif ont été approchées par des sommes pondérées de deux distributions “de base”, P 2 et P 2 , correspondant aux stimuli à un seul formant. Un accroissement de la proportion d'impulsions F 2 dans les stimuli à formant évolutif est accompagné d'un accroissement systématique de la composante P 2 de la distribution de réposens. Les stimuli avec formant évolutif n'ont pas suscité les réponses phonémiques caractéristiques des stimuli à 2 formants avec mémes fréquences de F 1 et F 2.

Although theoretical papers have discussed this structure, few papers describe the language performance of L2 learners. In addition, only rarely is oral production analyzed. To address this gap, we examined infinitival and gerundival VCs produced in free production speech by high-intermediate learners of English as a second language with mixed language backgrounds. Importantly, we explored the constructions by the VC produced and by the matrix verb requirements which has been underreported. Both aspects are necessary to understand what makes a VC attempt incorrect. These learners produced many VC constructions but not always correctly. The majority of the errors in VC usage involved either using neither marker or using both, even with matrix verbs which allow either VC.']",1,0

"[""A recently proposed pitch detection algorithm (Dologlou and Carayannis, Speech Communication, Vol. 8, 1989) used iterative low-pass, zero-phase filtering followed by pulse-to-pulse measurements on the filtered signal. The iterative low-pass filtering was terminated when the signal had a sufficiently sinusoidal appearance. The halting criterion used was that frequencies derived from an autocorrelation analysis and a second order LPC analysis should be sufficiently close to each other. A claim is made by the authors that unless the input was a pure sinusoid, the two frequencies would never be equal. We discuss the proposed halting criterion and give an example with a speech-like signal consisting of two sinusoids of comparable amplitudes; this example violates the claim concerning the uniqueness of the two frequencies and where the proposed algorithm would halt prematurely. Ein vor kurzer Zeit veröffentlichter Algorithmus zur Bestimmung der Sprachgrundfrequenz (Dologlou und Carayannis, Speech Communication, Vol. 8, 1989) basiert auf der iterativen Anwendung eines Tiefpaßfilters, dessen Phase null ist, gefolgt von einer Bestimmung der einzelnen Sprachgrundperioden anhand des gefilterten Signals. In diesem Algorithmus wird die Iteration dann beendet, wenn das gefilterte Signal hinreichend sinusförmig ist, wobei das Abbruchkriterium dann als erfüllt gilt, wenn ein Autokorrelationsanalyseverfahren und unabhängig davon die Analyse mit Hilfe eines linearen Prädiktors 2. Grades hinreichend nahe beieinanderliegende Schätzwerte für die Frequenz des Signals liefern. Hierbei wurde die Behauptung aufgestellt, daß die beiden Schätzwerte nur für rein sinusförmige Signale exakt gleich sind. Wir diskutierten das vorgeschlahene Abbruchkriterium anhand des Beispiels eines sprachähnlichen Signals, das aus zwei Sinusschwingungem vergleichbarer Amplitude besteht. Die Analyse dieses Signals liefert einen Widerspruch zu der Behauptung bezüglich der Gleichheit der beiden Frequenzschätzwerte; in diesem Fall würde die Iteration vorzeitig abgebrochen. Un algorithme récemment proposé pour la détermination de la fréquence fondamentale du signal de parole (Dologlou et Carayannis, Speech Communication, Vol. 8, 1989) utilisait un filtrage passe-bas itératif de phase nulle, suivi de mesures du signal filtré entre deux impulsions d'excitation successives. Le filtrage passe-bas itératif était achevé lorsque le signal avait acquis un profil suffisamment sinusoïdal. Le critère d'arrêt choisi était que les fréquences dérivées d'une analyse d'autocorrélation et d'une analyse LPC de second ordre devaient êntre suffisamment proches l'une de l'autre. Les auteurs affirmaient par ailleurs que, à moins que le signal d'entrée ne soit une sinusoïde pure, les deux fréquences ne devaient jamais être égales. Nous discutons ici de ce critère d'arrð proposé et donnons un exemple concernant un signal proche du signal acoustique de la parole, consistant en deux sinusoïdes d'amplitudes comparables. Cet exemple de signal contredit l'affirmation concernant la différence entre les deux fréquences car il entraîne l'interruption prématurée de l'algorithme proposé.""]",1,0

Neither the OED nor the NID3 lists the word as an Americanism, but the OED's earliest and the NID3's only citations are American.

Murfree's Prophet of the Great Smoky Mountains: He sick-ed him on all the time (of a man)-the OED does not recognize that the use of a personal object of the verb in this sense is extended from its use with dogs, of which the dictionary originally had no examples.2 The OEDS, however, in 1933 corrects this defect with the addition to sense 2 of 'Also, to set (a dog) on.' The OEDS adds earlier citations for both senses, both from the same American work: J. J. Hooper, Taking Census (1845).

"[""The objective of this research was to develop a preliminary Perceived Story Quality Index to assess laypersons' views of story quality. Research to date has not employed a standard measure of perceived quality, nor reported whether different lay-raters judge stories similarly. The study involved systematically generating core dimensions of perceived story quality and addressing whether (a) lay-raters of different ages and genders evaluate story quality consistently and (b) multiple dimensions of story quality form a general factor (i.e., an index). Sixteen lay-raters judged 129 autobiographical and fictional stories. Analyses show that young and older men and women lay-raters judged story quality consistently (i.e., share an implicit theory) and that quality ratings form a unitary factor. This structure holds for both types of stories and is maintained across age and gender.

"['Jibbali and Mehri nouns and adjectives of the form C 1 V́C 2 (ə)C 3 (-) exhibit various vowels in stressed V 1 position, whereas it is not always clear whether a phonological /ə/ must be posited in post-tonic V 2 . This article investigates the patterns underlying such items. It appears that in both languages the presence of a /ə/ in V 2 is fundamentally determined by the pattern (some patterns implying /ə/ and others ∅), although the presence of a sonorant as the third root consonant conditions the presence of a /ə/ in actual lexemes whatever the pattern. This together with other phonological processes creates, especially in Mehri, complicated cross-matches between the underlying patterns and the attested realisations. Their identification sheds light on the morphological correspondences between Mehri and Jibbali. It is finally argued that patterns of the C 1 V́C 2 C 3 type go back to Proto-Semitic patterns in *C 1 VC 2 C 3 , whereas most patterns of the C 1 V́C 2 əC 3 type go back to *C 1 ā̆C 2 ī̆C 3 .']",1,0

"['Abstract The purpose of the present study is to investigate pragmatic transfer in refusals by native speakers of Mandarin speaking English, and to what extent transfer is influenced by the learners’ level of L2 proficiency. The elicitation instrument used for data collection was the discourse completion questionnaire developed by Beebe et al. [Beebe, L., Takahashi, T., Uliss-Weltz, R., 1990. Pragmatic transfer in ESL refusals. In: Scarcella, R. et al. (Eds.), Developing Communicative Competence in a Second Language. Newbury House, New York, pp. 55–73] Participants in this study were composed of four groups: 35 American college students (AE), 41 English-major seniors (SE), 40 English-major freshmen (FE), and 40 Chinese-major sophomores (CC). The refusal responses were analyzed in terms of (1) the frequency of semantic formulas, and (2) the content of semantic formulas. It was found that while all groups employed a similar range of semantic formulas in responding to the refusals elicited by different initiating acts, they differed in the frequency and content of the semantic formulas.']",1,0
"[""On peut distinguer deux principaux groupes d'actualisateurs textuels: les actualisateurs généraux et les actualisateurs spécifiques. Le premier groupe comprend les déterminants définis et indéfinis, tandis que le second est constitué des noms propres, des locutions substantivales, des pronoms et des numéraux. Le slovène standard exprime le défini, entre autres, grâce à la forme définie de l'adjectif (dans les locutions figées, après les adjectifs démonstratifs et possessifs, quand il s'agit d'évoquer une particularité déjà connue ou évoquée, etc.). De leur côté, les substantifs sont en principe toujours définis. Cependant, si nous analysons l'expression du défini et de l'indéfini dans la langue parlée spontanée (par exemple, des locuteurs de Ljubljana), nous pouvons remarquer que cette dernière se différencie souvent de la langue standard par la présence généralisée des actualisateurs généraux, autrement dit des déterminants définis et indéfinis. L'analyse précise de textes variés montre ainsi que la langue parlée spontanée des locuteurs donnés exprime le plus souvent le défini et l'indéfini à l'aide d'actualisateurs généraux, ce qui, d'une certaine manière, la rapproche des langues romanes et germaniques où l'expression du défini et de l'indéfini est déjà codifiée dans le système de la langue standard.""]",1,0

Schultz, Vol: 12 (Apr. 1937), p. 154, and 'The Lingo of Railroad Linemen' by D. V. Snapp, Vol. 13 (Feb. 1938), p. 70f. More comprehensive than the sum of all of these is the glossary in The Railroader by W. F. Cottrell, Stanford University Press (1940), pp. 118-139. The list in The Railroader was compiled from H. L. Mencken's revised edition of The American Language (1936), M. H. Weseen's Dictionary of American Slang (1934), Lucius Beebe's High Iron (1938), from various issues of The Railroad Magazine, and from the author's personal experience. A comprehensive glossary is also given by Freeman H. Hubbard, editor, in the April, 1940, issue of The Railroad Magazine under the title 'Lingo of the Rails.' Batie has a few terms not included in the Railroader glossary. These are G.Y.M., pop car, skunk, train detainer, whiz. Additions by Schultz are hand grenade, hog back, iron man, latch, Little Nemo, sag, target. Snapp's terms belong to a special category and are not found in the other lists, except that corner, meaning a pole to be guyed on account of deviation of line, has a different interpretation in Cottrell's glossary (see below). To a lineman a slug is a block to be buried for anchor with a different meaning to the railroad man (see below), while a crummy is logically a bunk car to a lineman rather than the caboose. Grunt, the lineman's helper, is listed by both Cottrell and Snapp with the additional meaning of locomotive driver given by the former. There are otherwise few differences in meaning recorded. Batie adds an explanation of the origin of brownie, crummy, snake. Cottrell explains shack, brakeman, as probably named after the small huts which in the early days of railroading were frequently mounted on a car near the middle of a train, from which the brakeman sallied to set the hand brakes. Batie suggests that when the train is moving the brakeman stays in the caboose; hence the term shack is applied to him. Some of the railroad""]",1,0

"['In this paper I shall present a truth conditional semantics for simple adjectival comparatives. The leading idea is that the semantics should hug closely to the surface syntax of the construction and should not depend on postulating degrees or extents as primitive entities. The remainder of this introductory section will raise some objections to existing accounts of the semantics of comparative constructions. In Section 2 it will be argued that an adequate analysis of compared adjectives must take into account the vagueness of positive adjectives, and that the latter can be captured by interpreting degree adjectives as partial functions. Section 3 contains an analysis of degree modifiers, and in Section 4 this analysis provides the basis for the interpretation of comparatives. Section 5 spells out some consequences of the theory, while the last section contains a summary and conclusion.']",1,0

Contact received both an implicit and an explicit treatment. Explicitly, Stokoe included a symbol for contactual action or touch as one of the possible values for movement. Implicitly, his analysis of place of formation separates the contact signs from the non-contact signs by the assignment of aspect values. There are 12 possible values for location: 6 for the face, head, and neck, 1 for the trunk, 2 for the arm, 2 for the hand, and 1 for “neutral space”. Any sign which makes contact with a body part is then assigned a location value for that body part, while signs that make no contact at all are assigned to neutral space.1 When subsequent analyses were proposed (Battison 1973; Battison, Markowicz & Woodward 1975), an additional major parameter, Orientation of the hands, was suggested.2 Contact did not receive much emphasis, in part because signs were seen only as either having contact or not having contact, and in part because even those signs that did have contact easily lost it in rapid signing, casual signing, and encumbered signing.

Several new editions, shortened or otherwise more or less revised, came out in Sweden after the war (the major ones in 1945 and 1976, in order to meet the great demand for such a dictionary among the Estonian refugees in Sweden. A separate Swedish-Estonian dictionary was issued in Soviet Estonia in 1979. These medium size dictionaries were the precursors of the new dictionary. Containing about 100,000 headwords, the new work is the most comprehensive Swedish-Estonian dictionary ever published.When the compilers set about writing the new dictionary, they did not only sort out obsoletisms and add neologisms (especially a rich selection of more recent words in technical and specialist language) from the precursors, but also made a complete refvision of the vocabulary with regard to the totally new political, economical, social and cultural situation characteristic of Estonia since 1991.']",1,0

Those campaigns aimed at teaching immigrants Brazil's national language and at officially discouraging them from talking or writing their own languages. From these two facts, one can see how citizenship and Brazilianity are related to the general questions of language and nationality. At the root of those juridical measures there is a discursive formulation of national unity and linguistic homogeneity, related to the heterogeneity of Brazilian society.""]",1,0

In his keynote speech, Prof. Shao said that the project aimed at making a full-scale systematic investigation on overseas Chinese grammatical studies and tracking their development.4 A vital component of the project is the support from scholars around the world, in terms of their knowledge of the field and of various locations. The project has five sub-projects covering (i) the United States and America; (ii) Europe and Africa; (iii) Southeast Asia and Oceania; [End Page 497] (iv) Japan and Korea; and (v) Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. The five sub-projects are led by Prof. Audrey Yen-Hui Li (University of Southern California, USA), Prof. Chong Qi 齐冲 Université Paris Diderot-Paris 7, France), Prof. Kang-Kwong Luke 陆镜光 (Nanyang Technological University, Singapore), Prof. Shi Dingxu 石定栩 (Guangdong University of Foreign Studies (Guangdong Waiyu Waimao Daxue, China), and Prof. Zhao Chunli 赵春利(Jinan University, China). The project will be implemented in two stages. Stage I focuses on data and literature collection, including information of publications, conferences, academic organizations, academic activities and biographies of key overseas Chinese grammarians. Stage II is on the developmental phases of overseas Chinese grammatical studies based on the literature, personal interviews or communication. (Shao 2017, 4) The project is expected to produce a five-volume book on the history of overseas Chinese grammatical studies, each volume focusing on a particular area. A sketch of the historical development of overseas Chinese grammatical studies will be presented first, followed by descriptions of the linguistic theories involved, the key overseas Chinese grammarians, inter-disciplinary studies and applied studies of Chinese grammar. A database will be constructed simultaneously, covering all the information related to overseas Chinese grammatical studies. The plan is to publish 3–5 review articles on the leading linguistic journals at the same time.

"['The “dative of agent” construction in the Indo-European languages is most likely inherited from Proto-Indo-European (Hettrich 1990). Two recent proposals (Danesi 2013; Luraghi 2016), however, claim that the construction contains no agent at all. Luraghi argues that it is a secondary development from an original beneficiary function, while Danesi maintains that the construction is indeed reconstructable. Following Danesi, we analyze the relevant data in six different Indo-European languages: Sanskrit, Avestan, Ancient Greek, Latin, Tocharian, and Lithuanian, revealing similarities at a morphosyntactic level, a semantic level, and to some extent at an etymological level. An analysis involving a modal reading of the predicate, with a dative subject and a nominative object, is better equipped to account for the particulars of the construction than the traditional agentive/passive analysis. The proposal is couched within Construction Grammar, where the basic unit of language is the construction, i. e. a form-function correspondence. As constructions are by definition units of comparanda, they can be successfully utilized in the reconstruction of a proto-construction for Proto-Indo-European.']",1,0

"['The Nuosu (Nosu) Yi language, or Northern Yi (北部彝语), is spoken by approximately two million people in southern Sichuan Province and northern Yunnan Province, China, the majority of whom are monolingual. Yi is a member of the Yi Branch of the Lolo-Burmese subgroup of the Tibeto-Burman family (Benedict 1972/2009, Bradley 1979), which includes some 50 languages, also called the Nisoic languages (Lama 2012) or Ngwi Group. The large (5 million) ethnic Yi nationality groups of Yunnan Province are distantly related. The third author, Lama Ziwo, who was 31 at the time of recording, produced, translated and transcribed the recorded audio data phonemically and participated in the laryngoscopic filming of the video data. He is a native speaker of the Suondip/Suondi dialect, and a fluent speaker of the Shypnra/Shengza dialect. It is the Shypnra/Shengza standard dialect that is being represented in this paper. The most distinguishing phonetic feature of Northern Yi is its systematic vocal register contrast (Matisoff 1972, Dai 1990) between two settings of the laryngeal constrictor mechanism, which are referred to as a lax (unconstricted) series and a tense (constricted) series (Edmondson et al. 2000, 2001). The contrast is realized as a distinction in resonance (spectral quality) rather than as contrasting phonation types as in some other forms of Yi or in other Tibeto-Burman languages (e.g. Bai). The consonantal inventory is large, with complex vocalic interactions, including interactions with two pairs of fricativized vowels. Northern Yi has 43 initial consonants, five pairs of vowels (or syllable rhymes), and three tones: 55, 33, and 21. Relevant reports on voice quality in related languages can be found in Maddieson &amp; Ladefoged (1985) and Sun &amp; Liu (1986).']",1,0

"['Abstract Three options present themselves for generating compound words within classical generative theory from Chomsky (Aspects of the Theory of Syntax. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, 1995) up to and including GB Theory (Chomsky, Lectures on Government and Binding. Foris, Dordrecht, 1981): they can be base-generated, they can be generated by movement rules or they can be generated by lexical rules. Incorporation, for example, according to Baker (Incorporation: a Theory of Grammatical Function Changing, University of Chicago Press, Chicago, 1988), forms compound words by movement rules. Jackendoff (Morphological and semantic regularities in the lexicon. Language 51, 639–671,1975) among many others adopts a lexicalist account of compounding where lexical rules are used to filter out redundant, i.e. rule-governed aspects of the representation of structurally complex lexical items. Here it is proposed that compounds are base-generated following Liberman and Sproat (The stress and structure of modified noun phrases in English. In: Sag, I.A., Szabolcsi, A. (Eds.), Lexical Matters. CSLI, Stanford, pp. 131–181,1992). It will be shown that significant properties of compounds, perhaps all linguistically significant properties, follow from their being generated by adjunction to X° either by movement or D-structure adjunction. This entails specifically that there can be no phrasal compounds and no synthetic compounds.']",1,0

"['The article addresses some issues connected with the disciplinary status of lexicography. Drawing on the views of scholars such as L. Zgusta, R. Ilson, H. Wiegand, R. Gouws, H. Bergenholtz, S. Tarp, R. Lew and others, the author argues in favour of the viewpoint that lexicography is a science and that working on a dictionary is a scientific activity. The main issues tackled in the paper include understanding the complex nature of word meaning, the role of dictionaries in the description of word meaning and the development of lexical semantics. Attention is also paid to the definitional method of the study of word meaning, which is based on the analysis of dictionary definitions, components of the theory of lexicography, the relation between lexicographic theory and practice, and the teaching of lexicography as an academic discipline at universities. The author argues that the right approach to lexicography and its disciplinary status is particularly important in our era of globalisation. Only state-of-the-art lexicographic and corpus resources will secure the future of many languages, particularly lesser-used languages, and such resources will not be created until lexicography receives proper recognition as a science with big interdisciplinary vocation (Tarp 2017); until lexicography is turned into an academic discipline through advanced theory of lexicography, through teaching lexicography at universities, etc.']",1,0

This paper analyzes speech reporting in 500 Chinese criminal judgements and identifies three major findings. First, speech reporting in criminal judgements includes two general types, procedural reporting and substantive reporting , both of which can be further categorized into three sub-types, direct reporting , indirect reporting , and narrative report of speech act . Second, procedural reporting mainly appears in the beginning and body parts of a criminal judgement to introduce the origin of the case, clarify relevant legal concepts, indicate the basis of conviction and judgement, and maintain, approve, and reject the judgement of a lower court, performing the function of maintaining procedural justice. Third, substantive reporting mainly occurs in the body part of a criminal judgement to state, summarize, generalize, and clarify relevant facts and evidence, serving substantive justice.']",1,0

"['This article investigates the phenomenon of rhoticity in the speech of black speakers of South African English. Historically, South African English is non-rhotic. Thus, any shift towards a rhotic variant is a significant language change. Thirty-nine interviews were conducted with both males and female participants. The two groups were evenly split into more and less affluent groups. It was found that rhoticity in Black South African English is preferentially a female phenomenon, found most frequently in affluent female speakers. Male speakers also exhibit this feature but less frequently so. Of the affluent females 90% displayed some degree of rhoticity. None of the less affluent males displayed any rhoticity. The data gathered seem to suggest that a covert prestige exists amongst men to use their African languages. This is in contrast to the overt prestige amongst women to use English. The research thus isolates an important socio-economic stratification, providing evidence that both gender and affluence influences the degree in which a group creates a new language variety. We also speculate about reasons for the adaptation of rhoticity in affluent, female speakers, thus providing the basis for a follow-up study in which the sociological dimension of this linguistic phenomenon is explored in more detail.']",1,0

Empathy and syntax. Linguistic Inquiry 8(4). 627–672) or give up this privilege of empathy in consideration for the respected Actor in the event. The study suggests that social consideration takes precedence over of the Speech-Act Empathy Hierarchy unless both are satisfied simultaneously.

These words were read out in isolation by fifteen male speakers of Dutch. The formants F 1–3 (in Bark) were extracted from the steady-state of each vowel /a,i,u/. Coarticulation in each of 1200 realisations per vowel was measured in F 1–3 as a function of consonantal context, using a score-model based measure called COART. The largest amount of coarticulation was found in /u/ where nasals and alveolars in C 1 -position had the largest effect on the formant positions, especially on F 2 . Coarticulation in /a,u/ proved to be speaker-specific. For these vowels the speaker variability of COART in a context was larger, generally, if COART itself was larger. Studied in a speaker identification task, finally, COART improved identification results only when three conditions were combined: (a) if COART was used as an additional parameter to F 1–3 ; (b) if the COART-values for the vowel were high; (c) if all vowel contexts were pooled in the analysis. The two main conclusions from this study are that coarticulation cannot be investigated speaker-independently and that COART can be contributive to speaker identification, but only in very restricted conditions.']",1,0

"['Decoding-based reading disorder (RD; aka developmental dyslexia) is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders, affecting approximately 5-10% of school-aged children across languages. Even though neuroimaging studies suggest an impairment of the left reading network in RD, the onset of this deficit and its developmental course, which may include constancy and change, is largely unknown. There is now growing evidence that the recruitment of brain networks underlying perceptual, cognitive and linguistic processes relevant to reading acquisition varies with age. These age-dependent changes may in turn impact the neurocognitive characteristics of RD observed at specific developmental stages. Here we synthesize findings from functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies to increase our understanding of the developmental time course of the neural bases underlying (a)typical reading. We first provide an overview of the brain bases of typical and atypical (impaired) reading. Next we describe how the understanding of RD can be deepened through scientific attention to age effects, for example, by integrating findings from cross-sectional studies of RD at various ages. Finally, we accent findings from extant longitudinal studies that directly examine developmental reading trajectories beginning in the preliterate stage at both group and individual levels. Although science is at the very early stage of understanding developmental aspects of neural deficits in RD, evidence to date characterizes RD by atypical brain maturation. We know that reading impairment may adversely impact multiple life domains such as academic achievement and social relationships, and unfortunately, that these negative outcomes can persist and compound into adulthood. We contend that exploring the developmental trajectories of RD will contribute to a greater understanding of how neural systems support reading acquisition. Further, we propose and cite evidence that the etiology of RD can be better investigated by distinguishing primary deficits from secondary impairments unfolding along development. These exciting and modern investigatory efforts can also indirectly contribute to a centered practice of early and accurate identification and optimal intervention to support the development of foundational pre-literacy skills and fluent reading. In sum, integrating a developmental understanding into the science and practice of reading acquisition and intervention is both possible and necessary.']",1,0

"['Abstract This article traces the long-running conflict between the interests of ‘Language’ and ‘Literature’ within English studies in Britain, using as springboard a letter from C. S. Lewis (then professor of Medieval and Renaissance Literature), to Angus McIntosh (then professor of English Language and General Linguistics). Written in 1961 when ‘Lang. &amp; Lit.’ hostilities were at their height, the letter points two ways: back to old battles in Schools of English between philologists and literary scholars, historians and critics, and forward to continuing disputes about the contribution of linguistics to literary criticism. The main focus is on the period 1957–1977, before the impact of structuralism and poststructuralism diverted the attention of literary scholars, but during the development of stylistics as a method of analysing literary texts. McIntosh emerges as a pioneering figure in the struggle to achieve an effective integration of literary and linguistic studies.']",1,0

"['Abstract Representation of words in different languages is fundamental for various cross-lingual applications. In the past researches, there was an argument in using or not using word alignment in learning bilingual word representations. This paper presents a comprehensive empirical study on the uses of parallel corpus to learn the word representations in the embedding space. Various non-alignment and alignment approaches are explored to formulate the contexts for Skip-gram modeling. In the approaches without word alignment, concatenating A and B, concatenating B and A, interleaving A with B, shuffling A and B, and using A and B separately are considered, where A and B denote parallel sentences in two languages. In the approaches with word alignment, three word alignment tools, including GIZA++, TsinghuaAligner, and fast_align, are employed to align words in sentences A and B. The effects of alignment direction from A to B or from B to A are also discussed. To deal with the unaligned words in the word alignment approach, two alternatives, using the words aligned with their immediate neighbors and using the words in the interleaving approach, are explored. We evaluate the performance of the adopted approaches in four tasks, including bilingual dictionary induction, cross-lingual information retrieval, cross-lingual analogy reasoning, and cross-lingual word semantic relatedness. These tasks cover the issues of translation, reasoning, and information access. Experimental results show the word alignment approach with conditional interleaving achieves the best performance in most of the tasks.']",1,0

"['Do metonymies play any role in the emergence of metaphors? There is a debate between scholars who suggest that many metaphors are based on, or derive from, metonymies, versus those who do not see such connection between the two. “Resemblance metaphors” do not seem to have anything to do with metonymy. However, in the case of “correlation metaphors” (see, e.g., Grady, 1997a Grady, J. 1997a. Foundations of meaning: Primary metaphors and primary scenes, University of California at Berkeley. (Unpublished doctoral dissertation) [Google Scholar], 1997b Grady, J. 1997b. theories are buildings revisited. Cognitive Linguistics, 8: 267–290.

[Google Scholar]), several researchers argue that metaphors arise from, and are not independent of, metonymies. My specific proposal in the article is that correlation-based metaphors emerge from frame-like mental representations through a metonymic stage. I suggest this happens when one of the elements of a frame-like mental structure is generalized (schematized) to a concept that lies outside the initial frame in a different part of the conceptual system. The generalization process leads to sufficient conceptual distance between the initial and the new frame on which metaphors can be based.']",1,0

Tenishev (1976), D. A. Pavlov (1982) and B. V. Menyaev (2009). The corpus of Sart-Kalmyk song texts has been posted by the authors of this article on the website http://kalmyki.narod.ru. The texts of the Olot songs of the Ili-Kazakh Autonomous Region of Xinjiang previously recorded by the authors of the article during the expeditions of 2012 and 2020 have been taken into consideration as well. All the nouns under analysis have been divided into the following lexico-semantic groups: “ethnonyms” (lexical units denoting people according to their nationality), “kinship terms” (lexical units denoting people according to their relationships), “lexical units denoting people according to their gender and age”, “titles” (lexical units denoting titles), “anthroponyms” (proper names); “lexical units denoting domestic animals” etc. Some lexical units are provided with comments from archival, expedition, and published materials. The analysis of the vocabulary of Sart-Kalmyk songs clearly shows that it is based on common Oirat lexicon which incorporated a number of early borrowings from other languages. Later borrowings from the Kyrgyz language have not been found in the texts of the Sart-Kalmyk songs. Therefore, the songs of the Sart-Kalmyks were created before their move to the valley of the Karakol River and before their conversion to Islam. The results of the research can contribute to further analysis of the lexical structure of Sart-Kalmyk song texts.']",1,0

"['Rhyming slang (RS) sprang to life in mid-19th century London when it was first recorded by Ducange Anglicus (1857) together with other unusual forms of slang, such as back slang and Polari. In the period of extensive British emigration to the United States, Canada, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand, this special type of lexis was also carried around the world — though in much less regular distribution than might have been expected on the basis of shared socioeconomic colonial histories. Three types of development were possible: 1. individual RS items might survive (and possibly acquire new meanings); 2. they might die out, leaving a historical record of their extraterritorial existence at best; 3. they might prompt local fashions, imitating the pattern but creating new words. The phenomenon of RS has found various references in books on national Englishes (such as those by Baker (1970), but significantly less so in Ramson (1966) and Mencken (1977)); however, it has never been explored on a contrastive level. Such an approach has become more feasible today now that the set of historical dictionaries of English is complete following the publication of the works edited by Silva (1996), Ramson (1988) and Orsman (1997) — even though slang is badly documented, since it was not always considered worthy of inclusion in general dictionaries.']",1,0

Chinese synthetic verbs simultaneously express manner information and path/result information, but encode them into separate root slots under Beavers and Koontz-Garboden’s (2012. Manner and result in the roots of verbal meaning. Linguistic Inquiry 43(3). 331–369) scopal modifier test, so they differ from English “manner+result verbs” and further challenge the manner/result complementarity hypothesis. Synthetic verbs followed by redundant path/result verbs constitute double-framing structures that twice encode the framing information, and the non-motion case, i.e., the “synthetic verb+result verb” structure, supplements Croft et al.’s (2010. Revising Talmy’s typological classification of complex event constructions. In Hans C. Boas (ed.), Contrastive studies in construction grammar , vol. 10, 201–235. Amsterdam &amp; Philadelphia: John Benjamins Publishing Company) classification that only includes the motion case, so that Chinese synthetic verbs complement the discussion on double-framing structures. This paper thereby further falsifies the manner/result complementarity hypothesis and provides an overall illustration of the double-framing structure in cognitive typology. This paper also illustrates the diachronic changes of manner, which might be universal and await further investigation.']",1,0

"['Abstract This paper explores the taysin construction in Korean, Clause A taysin Clause B , which can convey corrective semantics (‘Clause B instead of Clause A ,’ where only Clause B holds) or compensatory concessive semantics (‘Clause B even though Clause A ,’ ‘Clause B in exchange for Clause A ,’ where both clauses hold). The taysin construction is remarkable in that (1) when it conveys corrective semantics, it may not require any overt negativizer as correctives usually do (e.g., he is not rich, but instead poor ) and in that (2) its function covers a specific type of concessive—compensatory concessive. I contend that the various uses of this versatile construction are conceptually related by showing that all evoke mutual exclusiveness at some level (whether profiled or not) and that there must always be an assessment of compensation/offset between the effects of situations referred to in the two clauses. To explicate the constructional polysemy better, this study clarifies definitions of corrective and compensatory concessive and argues that the uses are better grasped by employing the domain analysis (following Sweetser, 1990 ). Then, this study provides a systematic account of the distribution of the taysin construction in Korean by discussing how the relevant mutual exclusiveness is construed together with compensation/offset as being at the content, epistemic, or speech-act level.']",1,0

"[""Decontextualized talk is assumed to be used only rarely when children are younger than 30 months. Motivated by Bühler's (1934/1999) linguistic theory that describes different dimensions of (de-)contextualization, we provide evidence that this kind of input can already be found in caregivers’ talking to their 12-month-old children. Such early input is characterized by being decontextualized on some dimensions while being grounded in the immediate context on others. In this way, parents may scaffold understanding of talk about the there-and-then . We also examined whether caregivers adapt decontextualized verbal input to individual trajectories in language development. We observed 59 parent–child interactions within a decorated room when children were 12 months old, and assessed the children's linguistic development at 12 and 24 months of age. However, we did not find differences in the input directed toward children with different trajectories in language development.""]",1,0

"['Haitian has optional regressive nasal assimilation in a vowel-nasal (VN) context: /fami/ [fãmi] ‘family’. It is found also in recent loan-words in contexts where the source lacks phonetic nasalization. This process systematically underapplies in VNs that correspond to vowel-rhotic-nasal (VRN) sequences in French: [ʃãm] chambre ‘room’ vs. [ʃam] charme ‘charm’. We claim that etymological VRN and VR# have a different synchronic description: VRNs have no R, but VR#s do. VRNs crucially contain an empty CV that disrupts the locality between the trigger/target of nasal assimilation, hence the counterfeeding: /ʃam/ [ʃãm] ‘room’ vs. /ʃaCVm/ = [ʃam] / *[ʃãm] ‘charm’. According to this analysis, only VR#s have synchronic R: [tε ‘land’ vs. [ã-teR¸-e] ‘to land’. VR# forms interact with the morphology in interesting ways. Haitian has a case of nonoptimizing phonologically conditioned allomorph selection (PCA), /-a/ after V and /-la/ after C: [lapli-a] ‘the rain’ vs. [ʃat-la] ‘the cat’. However, here VR# forms create opaque and nonoptimizing R-less forms: [tε-a] / *[tε-Ra] ‘the land’ (cf. [ã-teR-e] ‘to land’). This is solved with underlying floating consonants and a prevocalic phonological condition on R. PCA selection is eliminated since the surface variants are generated phonologically from unique underlying forms.']",1,0

The first two co-editors (Ji Young Shim and Tabea Ihsane) worked on the research project entitled Selection at the Interfaces, in which various linguistic aspects (e.g., syntactic structure, interface with semantics, etc.) of clausal and nominal complements in monolingual grammars were explored.1 To extend an investigation of these issues to bilingual contexts, they organized a two-day workshop entitled Clausal and Nominal Complements in Monolingual and Bilingual Grammars in June 2016, where the third co-editor (M. Carmen Parafita Couto) of this Special Issue was an invited speaker.2 The workshop aimed to investigate the left periphery of complements, in particular the left periphery of the clause and the nominal phrase and its edge, such as C(omplementizers) and D(eterminer) and other top-most functional layers, where languages may be parametrized differently, thus leading to linguistic variation.Within generative grammar, it has long been assumed that language variation is due to variation in the domain of functional categories and their morpho-syntactic properties [1,2]. Following this tradition, the left periphery of the clause has been extensively investigated, confirming the hypothesis that the functional category C(omplementizer) and its morpho-syntactic properties may be parameterized differently across languages within research on monolingual grammar [3,4,5,6]. In addition, the left periphery of a nominal phrase has also been investigated to a great extent [7,8,9], based on the proposal that clauses and nominal phrases have parallel structures ([10] and in subsequent work).In recent years, generative linguists have also started to pay attention to the left periphery of bilingual grammars, especially in relation to diverse patterns of code-switching, which is the mixed use of two or more languages in conversation, and which is frequently observed in bilingual speech. Under the assumption that monolingual and bilingual grammars are subject to the same grammatical principles [11,12,13,14], several researchers have investigated the grammar of code-switching in various language pairs and showed that the left periphery of a particular functional category such as C, D, or v may be parameterized differently across languages and derive certain patterns of code-switching, which confirm the validity of the linguistic proposals that are put forth to account for monolingual grammars [15,16,17].While the workshop Clausal and Nominal Complements in Monolingual and Bilingual Grammars motivated us to edit the current Special Issue with the same title, it is important to note that the present volume is not a report on the proceedings of the workshop. A separate call for papers for this volume was made through Languages. The Special Issue Clausal and Nominal Complements in Monolingual and Bilingual Grammars comprises seven articles in total, which are theory-oriented and/or empirically based in nature. These articles collectively investigate one of the key theoretical issues that generative linguists have pursued for a long time: how languages are encoded similarly or differently. In so doing, three articles concentrate on nominal complements and clausal complements in monolingual grammars [18,19,20], and four articles focus on nominal and clausal complements in bilingual grammars [21,22,23,24].For monolingual contexts, Christopher Laenzlinger compares the structure of clauses (Complementizer Phrases; CPs) and noun/determiner phrases (DPs) [18]. Working in the cartographic approach to the Generative Grammar framework, he reconsiders so-called clause/noun-phrase (non-)parallelism in terms of structure and derivation. Although he assumes that both clauses and nominal phrases have a similar structure, which is divided into three domains—the Nachfeld (‘right periphery’), the Mittelfeld (‘midfield’) and the Vorfeld (‘left periphery’)—he argues that the inner structures of clauses and noun phrases are not strictly parallel, and in particular the left periphery of a clause is richer and more developed than that of a noun phrase. As a result, despite the similar possible types of movement occurring both in the CP and the DP domains (head movement and phrasal movement), there still exists non-parallelism in CPs and DPs in the application of these types of movement. To support the existence of non-parallelism between clauses and nominal phrases, Laenzlinger shows the respective orders of various elements such as adverbs/adjectives, DP/Prepositional Phrase (PP)-arguments and DP/PP-adjuncts in French in comparison with many other languages.In addition to Laenzlinger’s analysis [18], two more papers focus on the structure of clausal complements in monolingual grammars. Marcel den Dikken [19] revisits Chomsky’s two earlier approaches to account for the structure of clausal complements of verbs—a preform analysis [25] and a direct clausal embedding analysis [26], the latter of which has replaced the former and has become the generalized view in generative syntax. By comparing factive and non-factive clausal complements in Dutch and Hungarian, particularly the relative position of the verb vis-à-vis the clausal complement in Dutch and the co-occurrence of a proleptic noun with the clausal complement in Hungarian, den Dikken proposes that there are two structural positions for the object of verbs, the usual complement of the verb position and a specifier of VP (or a higher node). While the direct clausal embedding analysis accounts for the complement position of the object, it is the preform analysis (with a small modification) that can explain the specifier position of the object in these two languages. Den Dikken further builds up his proposal into analyzing wh-scope marking and wh-dependencies in Hungarian and German.The distinction between factive and non-factive clausal complements is also discussed in detail by Ji Young Shim and Tabea Ihsane [20]. They investigate clausal complements of factive and non-factive predicates in English, with particular focus on the distribution of overt and null that complementizers. To account for several differences between factive and non-factive clausal complements, including the distribution of the overt and null complementizers, they propose that overt that clauses and null that clauses have different underlying structures responsible for their different syntactic behavior. Adopting Rizzi’s split CP structure with two C heads, Force and Finiteness [3], Shim and Ihsane suggest that null that clauses are FinPs (Finiteness Phrases) under both factive and non-factive predicates, whereas overt that clauses have an extra functional layer above FinP, lexicalizing either the head Force under non-factive predicates or the light demonstrative head d under factive predicates. The authors argue that this analysis further provides an explanation for the distribution of overt that clauses and null that clauses outside sentential complements, such as sentential subjects.The interim conclusion of the papers by Laenzlinger [18], den Dikken [19] and Shim and Ihsane [20], which are based on the monolingual grammar of diverse languages, suggest that, despite the widely assumed structural parallelism between clauses and nominals, the clausal left periphery is more complex than the nominal left periphery, and the inner structure of the clausal left periphery also varies depending on its selection of predicates, such as factivity. Thus, to understand the precise nature of clausal and nominal left peripheries, we must also consider their interface with semantics and the lexical items that comprise them.As for bilingual contexts, Robert-Tissot and Morel [21] use a Swiss corpus of code-switching text messages to test two principles proposed by González Vilbazo [27]: (i) the Principle of Functional Restriction (i.e., two functional heads X° and Y° have to be filled by lexical material of the same language if the functional category of YP is the complement of X° and both heads are part of the same extended projection); and (ii) the Principle of Agreement (i.e., inside a phrase, agreement requirements have to be satisfied, regardless of the language providing the lexical material). They discuss specific examples that mostly confirm the validity of the principles, showing the structured nature of code-switching as well as contributing to the growing consensus that it is possible to predict the nature of grammatical and ungrammatical code- switched sequences.In their article, López et al. [22] show how the theoretical construct “phase” can be used to account for a number of restrictions on code-switching, in particular those formalized under the Principle of Functional Restriction [27] and the Phonetic Form Interface Condition [28]. López et al. postulate the Block Transfer Hypothesis (BTH), stating that the material that is transferred to the interfaces within a phase is transferred in one block. It follows from the BTH that code-switching may take place at phase boundaries but not within the phase. They further posit that phases are empirically superior in scope, as they can explain code-switching phenomena not explained by previous accounts (e.g., switches between C and TP, progressive aspect, and switching within the word level). The authors take this as reinforcement for the fundamental hypothesis that code-switching should be studied using the same tools that we use for monolingual data, and suggest that phase theory, together with distributed morphology, may be the way forward.In both studies (one by Robert-Tissot and Morel [21] and the other by López et al. [22]), the validity of the Principle of Functional Restriction (PFR) is tested. The PFR prohibits code-switching between two functional heads belonging in the same extended projection. Thus, it predicts that code-switching cannot occur in the left periphery of a nominal phrase (e.g., between a D(eterminer) and a Q(uantifier) and also in the left periphery of a clause (e.g., between a C(omplementizer) and T(ense)). However, both studies found counter-examples that allow code-switching in the left periphery of nominal and clausal domains. For instance, a switch may occur between a D (Italian) and a Q (French) [21] and between a C (Spanish) and T (German) if Spec C is not empty [22]. To account for these examples, Robert-Tissot and Morel resort to a non-structural account, whereas López et al. offer a phase-based syntactic analysis.The left periphery of noun phrases in bilingual contexts is explored in two papers in this volume. In her contribution [23], Brita Ramsevik Riksem investigates the heritage language American Norwegian and provides a diachronic study of language-mixing within noun phrases, that is, the occurrence of English items in American Norwegian. By comparing data collected in the 1930s and 1940s with recently collected data, she shows that the overall pattern of language-mixing is stable but some systematic diachronic changes are attested, specifically concerning the categories of number and definiteness. These changes consist of the omission of functional exponents and usage of English functional exponents, such as the plural suffix -s and the determiner the. She proposes two potential analyses of these patterns based on an exoskeletal approach to grammar, and a theoretical framework that separates abstract syntactic structure from its phonological exponents. These analyses consider both the structure and the exponents as the origins of the change. However, on the basis of the observed patterns of change, Riksem argues that a structural reanalysis of American Norwegian grammar is occurring.Finally, Blokzijl et al. explore the factors that influence the language of determiners in mixed nominal constructions in two bilingual corpora (Spanish-English speakers in Miami (USA), and Spanish-English creole speakers in Nicaragua) [24]. The results of their comparative analysis indicate that the language of the determiner matches the matrix language. Crucially, this match between the language of the determiner and the matrix language seems to be unaffected by any grammaticized features in the determiner, which is unlike that which has been previously argued [29]. Additionally, they found that the frequency of switching from the determiner to the noun was asymmetric in the Miami data, being more frequent from Spanish to English in the Miami data. In the Nicaragua data, on the other hand, they only observed switches from English creole to Spanish. These findings call into question the assumption that the same code-switching patterns surface in different bilingual communities, suggesting that we need to examine the interplay between social and grammatical factors more meticulously.Overall, this Special Issue provides a timely collection of articles that discuss clausal and nominal complements in monolingual and bilingual grammars, especially in the form of code-switching. As evidenced by several papers in this collection, the inner structure of clausal and nominal edges differs from language to language and it further affects patterns of code-switching. We hope that the papers in this Special Issue will generate keen interest in this topic and offer a basis for further research on other related topics. In particular, more work needs to be conducted to examine diachronic structural changes in bilingual grammars and syntactic variation in bi/multilingual contexts involving lesser-studied languages such as Creoles (e.g., Nicaragua, Belize, Cape Verde, etc.; see, for instance, the volume edited by Sessarego [30]). This direction of research will have much to tell us about linguistic variation across time and space. AcknowledgmentsWe thank all authors who contributed to this Special Issue and the reviewers of the manuscripts. Also we extend our thanks to the Editors of Languages (Osmer Balam and Usha Lakshmanan) and the editorial office for their support and patience to take a long journey with us. Without them, this Special Issue could not have been brought out. We hope that the seven papers included in this collection will provide readers with a deeper understanding of the structure of language and further their interest in the topic of clausal and nominal complements in monolingual and bilingual grammars.Author ContributionsJi Young Shim, Tabea Ihsane, and M.

"[""5X7HILE recognizing the cardinal importance of London speech in the VV rise of Standard English, we should be mindful of the influence of the other dialects in determining the form and pronunciation of many of our most common words. Certain examples are well known to all students of the English language: busy, for instance, has the pronunciation to be (historically) expected but displays a Western (or Southwestern) form; bury derives its form from the West its pronunciation from the Southeast of England-Kent and its environs. The purpose of this paper is to present a fairly complete list of Standard English words of native origin which have undergone such dialectal modification. The etymologies used here are those of Skeat and of Weekley, collected by means of a careful checking through of their etymological dictionaries, supplemented occasionally by examples (noted in each instance) gleaned from the excellent etymological material in H. C. Wyld's Universal Dictionary of the English Language. A few place-names revealing dialectal modification have been included, but no attempt at completeness has been made in that direction. The etymologies are those given in Eilert Ekwall's Concise Oxford Dictionary of English PlaceNames, Second Edition. I In London and the East Midlands as well as in the North, OE y was unrounded to i, and the forms with i are usually found in modern Standard English, as in hill from hyll and dizzX from dysig; but in Kent and its environs, including part at least of Sugolk, Essex, Surrey, and Sussex, we find e instead. (This localization is that made by Mr. J. P. Oakden on a 'Map to illustrate certain Dialect Boundaries with special reference to the 14th century' inserted in the first volume of his Allitertive Poetry in Middle English.)

"['This paper explores the language used by Australian Football League (AFL) footballers and Australian Broadcast Corporation (ABC) journalists in their post-match interviews broadcast on ABC (774 Melbourne) radio. From Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL), Appraisal is used to investigate the evaluative language expressed by the AFL footballers in their exchanges with ABC journalists. Despite the many applications of linguistics to media discourse, especially within SFL, this research is the first to analyse the language of Australian athletes in their post-match interviews. It is found that irrespective of the result of the game, ABC journalists and AFL footballers maintain a neutral stance by countering expressions of positive Attitude with negative Attitude, as well as employing Graduation and Engagement resources that reduce authorial endorsement. These findings are summarized and discussed, including reference to neutralism from Conversation Analysis. The paper goes on to claim that the tenor between AFL footballers, ABC journalists and the broadcast audience makes it difficult for AFL footballers to express authoritative evaluations. The ultimate aim is to show that AFL footballers do well to negotiate a particularly challenging register.']",1,0

"['When Powell published his exhaustive classification of the aboriginal languages of North America north of Mexico (1891), he set up 58 independent linguistic families. Since he was interested in establishing nomenclature as well as in determining families, he adopted the convention of adding the suffix -an or -ian to each of his proposed names. Even though it is desirable to have a uniform way of designating linguistic families, it turns out that the device has tended to obscure an extremely noteworthy fact about these families, namely that over 40 per cent of them are language isolates, that is, single languages with no demonstrable close relationship to any other single language or family of languages. Moreover, the majority of these language isolates were concentrated in two principal areas: (1) the “Pacific” area along the Pacific Coast from Southern Alaska to Baja California, and (2) the “Gulf” area along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico from Florida to Coahuila. Notwithstanding the fact that many of the language isolates of these two areas have now been subincluded in larger groupings, they remain, for the most part, but distantly related to their nearest congeners. For this reason they still play a significant role in imparting to these two large areas their distinctive character of great linguistic diversity.']",1,0

"['(PSEUDO)ARCHAISMEN IN ANTANAS BARANAUSKAS’ BIBELUBERSETZUNG Zusammenfassung In seiner Bibelubersetzung (1901–1902; im weiteren BaB genannt) verwendet Antanas Baranauskas aus stilistischen Grunden nicht nur die gangigen Archaismen der alten Texte, sondern auch kunstliche morphologische Formen, welche den fruheren Sprachzustand wiedergeben sollten, wie er nach den alten Texten, den Mundarten und den Erkenntnissen der historisch-vergleichenden Sprachwissenschaft sowie den Hypothesen des Autors rekonstruiert werden kann. Die in BaB vorkommenden durch das Fehlen der Partikel te - sowie die Endungen - ie, -y, -ai charakterisierten Formen des Kupitivs (geidžiamoji nuosaka) sind in Anlehnung an ahnliche Formen des Kupitivs und Imperativs der Mundarten und alten Texte gebildet. Auf die Partikel te - hat Baranauskas wahrscheinlich deswegen verzichtet, weil er das ursprungliche Paradigma des alten Optativs (der bei ihm als geistaikis bezeichnet wird) wiederherstellen wollte. Die dreifachen Endungen der Kupitivformen hat der Autor nicht streng mit irgendwelchen konkreten Prasensstammen verbunden, obwohl die Mundarten und insbesondere die alten Texte ein konsequenteres System aufweisen. Vom Gebrauch in den heutigen Mundarten und alten Texte unterscheidet sich die Vorgehensweise in BaB durch die haufige Verwendung der Formen mit - ai . Hier bekommen eine solche Endung nicht nur die ā- , sondern auch die ina - und sta -Stamme sowie die auf alten Nasalvokal ų + - va - auslautenden Infixprasentien. Vorbild fur die Formen auf - ai waren wahrscheinlich die in verschiedenen (besonders žemaitischen) Mundarten vorkommenden Formen der 3. Person Indikativ Prasens auf - ai mit vorausgestellter Partikel, die in der Funktion des Kupitivs gebraucht werden konnen. Zur Bevorzugung der Formen auf - ai konnte die Angabe in Schleichers Grammatik veranlast haben, das - ai der ursprungliche (baltoslavische?) Ausgang des Optativs gewesen sei. Ungewohnlich und hochstwahrscheinlich kunstlich sind in BaB die reflexiven Kupitivformen. Bei ihnen findet sich hier der Ausgang - ys(i ) (ob dieser auch bei ā -Stammen Verwendung fand, ist schwer zu beurteilen – es waren keine entsprechenden Beispiele auffindbar). Moglicherweise ist dieser Ausgang verallgemeinert auf Grund von Beispielen wie te alkinis (neben te alkinies ) DP. ahnlich verhalt es sich im Falle des Kupitivs der athematischen Verben. Wohl nach dem Muster altlitauischer Beispiele wie te saugti KN wird einigen athematischen Prasentien die Endung - y (gleichgesetzt mit dem Kupitivausgang der i -Stamme?) zugewiesen; aber bei den Formen der 3. Person Prasens auf - st (<- sti ) wird das ubliche - ie oder - ai verwendet, wohl weil sie mit den Formen der sta -Stamme in Verbindung gebracht wurden. Veranlast durch das Streben nach kunstlicher Wiederherstellung des alten Kupitivparadigmas, kommt in BaB auch die eine oder andere unkorrekte, „analogische“ Form vor, die vom Infinitivstamm aus ( twinie , Apsiwilkie ) oder mit Wechsel der Flexionsklasse ( sutwirty ; - i statt - ėja ) gebildet ist. Vorbild fur auffallige Formen des Partizip Prasens auf - ti-nt - waren die von einem Teil des Žemaitischen verwendeten umgebildeten Paradigmen athematischer Verben; dort haben die Partizipien ofters einen Stamm auf - ta-nt - (aber neben miegtąs auch miegtįs ). In Analogie zum Ausgang der 3. Person Prasens des i -Stamme verallgemeinert der Autor - ti-nt -: nach stovi (Kupitiv stovy ) – stovįs wurde eiti ( eity ) – eitįs geschaffen. Bei einigen Formen des Dativ Singular der Substantiva verwendet BaB im Anschlus an Dauksa und vielleicht nach den Nachbardialekten von Anyksciai die Endung - i der alten i - und Konsonantenstamme. Nach dem Vorbild Dauksas, Sirvydas’ und anderer alten Texte wird in einigen Fallen die pronominale Dativform mi gebraucht. Die Verwendung von - ys als Endung des Nominativ Singular des bestimmten Adjektivs zeigt wahrscheinlich, das der Autor seinen fruheren Plan aufgreift, die Endung mit dem alteren (und auch fur einen Teil der Mundarten charakteristischen) Ausgang - ys der i \ue519 a -Stamme zu verbinden. Wie den Briefen zu entnehmen ist, entschlos er sich etwa Mitte 1882, die Nominativ-Singularendung der bestimmten Adjektiva und Partizipien (ebenso die des Superlativs der Adjektiva) zum Ausgang - ias der \ue519 a -Stamme in Beziehung zu setzen, welcher nach seiner Ansicht nur zu - is kontrahiert werden konnte. Beim ubersetzen der Bibel kehrte er zum Teil wieder zu seiner in der ersten Halfte des Jahres 1882 praktizierten Verfahrensweise zuruck und verwendete bei den bestimmten Adjektiven die Endung - ys .']",1,0

"['This article investigates stigmatisation through metaphors that were borrowed from religious discourse in the early coverage of HIV and AIDS by the Sesotho press. The goal of the study is to provide insights into how stigma against people living with HIV emerged and developed in Lesotho. Employing the tenets of critical discourse analysis (CDA), the study examines the stigma that was encoded by religious metaphors used in the period 1986–2010, and the social agency behind the use of these metaphors. The analysis shows that the newspapers used the religious metaphors to perpetuate the stereotypes of people living with HIV as ‘sinners’. The findings show that one set of metaphors that the newspapers used was that of cleanliness metaphors. These metaphors portrayed both the conduct of people living with HIV and the people living with HIV themselves as ‘unclean’, with the expression ‘clean’ used as a metaphor for ‘being holy’. Another set of metaphors that the newspapers used involved the idea of a journey. These journey metaphors portrayed people living with HIV as sinners who followed ‘a wrong way or path’. The wide distribution of these metaphors from 1986 to 2010 suggests that the perceptions of people living with HIV as sinners were widespread.']",1,0

L’échange faisait intervenir cinq dyades d’étudiants universitaires ayant un niveau intermédiaire de compétence linguistique. Au total, sept tâches ont été réalisées dans chaque langue. L’analyse de la transcription de l’interaction a permis de dénombrer 915 épisodes mettant l’accent sur la forme (FFE — focus-on-form). Une analyse plus poussée des FFE a révélé que six types de ressources multimodales entraient en jeu au cours du processus de négociation : le clavardage, les images, l’ardoise blanche, la traduction électronique, la webcaméra et le dictionnaire papier. Parmi ces ressources, les plus fréquemment utilisées étaient le clavardage (comptant pour plus de la moitié de l’ensemble des FFE), les images et l’ardoise blanche. Bien que l’importance des ressources multimodales au cours de la négociation du sens ait été établie dans de précédentes études, les auteurs confirment ici la fréquence du recours à une combinaison de ressources, données statistiques à l’appui. À la différence des études précédentes, qui ont principalement porté sur Skype, la présente étude fait ressortir en quoi les possibilités accrues de la plateforme WebEx améliorent l’aptitude des participants à négocier le sens, particulièrement en ce qui se rapporte au clavardage, à la propriété du document partagé facilitant l’utilisation des images et à l’ardoise blanche pour les dessins.

In prior work the development has been conceptualized in a grammaticalization framework, with focus on the individual expression shì , rather than on its development in the context of both the immediate syntactic frame and also of other constructions such as the demonstrative shì construction and the copula wéi construction. We show that the copula shì construction went through various types of expansion and reduction. The change was not unidirectional in the way predicted by a grammaticalization model such as is proposed in e.g. Lehmann ( 1995 , 2004 ) and Haspelmath (2004) .']",1,0

"[""EVERYONE WHO IS SENSITIVE to relations between words has no doubt noticed, at one time or another, the manifold and sometimes puzzling relations that exist between nouns (or, more generally, primaries) and the words that modify them. Ordinary expressions like a perfect stranger, the Veterans Administration, steam shovel, my sincere desire, or the dead hand of the past seem clear enough in their meaning until we begin to ask ourselves how, precisely, the modifiers affect the meaning of the headword or primary, and whether, in each case, the relationship between primary and modifier is the same. The problem is sometimes complicated by the semantic ambiguity of the modifying word (perfect above, for example), or the elliptical nature of the expression (Veterans Administration), but I am concerned here with syntactic ambiguity. One way to make clear the relationships that exist between primary and adjunct is to use the symbolism that Otto Jespersen worked out in his Analytic Syntax.' The five expressions above show differences in syntactic form: a perfect stranger 2 (3) 'a stranger perfectly strange'; the Veterans Administration 2 (3)-I 'the administration for veterans' affairs'; steam shovel r-2_ 'an excavating shovel (formerly) operated by steam'; my sincere desire I22 'my desire which is sincere'; and the dead hand of the past 2 1 2 (p1). This is not the place to explain or justify Jespersen's system, or the theory of grammatical rank it is based on, but I should say that what follows will be best understood by the careful student of that system and that theory. My purpose in this paper is to add something to Jespersen's many scattered remarks on the restriction of primaries.2 I wish particularly to show the effect that pronunciation has on modification. The way that the student of language goes about answering the question of modification depends in large part on the ultimate aims of his study. Jespersen in his various works advanced one line of inquiry, and Fries in his American English Grammar3 another. The aim in both cases is to describe the facts of language, but Jespersen's method is, for the most part, to show points of similarity and difference between ordinary language and the language of logic, or, as he says, those points where grammatical form and logical notion meet;4""]",1,0

Acquiring linguistic constructions. In: D. Kuhn, R.S. Siegler, W. Damon, R.M.

Oxford University Press, Oxford; Hodges, B.H., Baron, R.M. 1992. Values as constraints on affordances: perceiving and acting properly.

Reed’s account highlights the collective appropriation of affordances, the precocious perception and enactment of “unfilled meanings,” and children’s becoming persons through the active structuring of their environment (e.g., gestural games, story-telling). Hodges and Baron’s account of values as multiple, heterarchical, dynamical, and legitimating constraints on actions is applied to cases of pragmatic rule violations, particularly Hodges and Geyer’s [Hodges, B.H., Geyer, A.L., 2006.

These ecological, social, and values-realizing accounts suggest that conversations are about seeking good prospects, caring for others and self, and inviting responsible action. The possibility of language as a perceptual system [Gibson, J.J., 1966. The Senses Considered as Perceptual Systems.

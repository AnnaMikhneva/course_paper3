"In 1968, I spent the months of May and June collating CT XLII, a volume consisting almost entirely of Sumerian literary tablets copied by H. H. Figulla.l On the whole, I found the copies outstanding for accuracy and trustworthiness, and that, in spite of the fact that the copyist is not a specialist in the field of Sumerian literature. There are, to be sure, as the following collations indicate, a considerable number of miscopies; but these are nearly always in the case of tablets where the writing is poorly preserved, or where the signs are so compactly written, that they are extremely difficult to read in many instances it would have been impossible for me to make the corrections, had I not had the benefit of duplicating material unavailable to the copyist. It is not out of place to repeat here a statement in my review of the volume in JCS XVIII: 35, that Figulla has made available to the scholarly world a highly significant group of Sumerian tablets which have been lving in the cupboards of the museum, unknown, unidentified, and unutilized, a feat which will earn him the deep gratitude of cuneiformists everywhere. No. 1. There is no ruled line dividing the tablet into columns either on the obverse or the reverse, and there should not be any in the copy. In obv. 1, the sign following hW u -1 u h hw a z u is poorly preserved, but it is probably A not u.2 In obv. 8, the fourth sign from the end is L U L. In rev. 19, the sign following M E (about the middle of the line) is probably E N (not NU). In rev. 45, between N U and T I L is probably A L (not A S and R I). The line at the very bottom of plate 3 was accidentally omitted by the scribe who therefore drew a ruled",1,0

"Lorsque des problèmes se posent dans l’interprétation des testaments, les juges anglais sont tenus de suivre la ‘règle littérale’, et de retrouver l’intention du testateur uniquement par l’analyse des mots utilisés. Cependant, ils sont souvent amenés à tenir compte du contexte, y compris pour déterminer la référence des noms propres ou des descriptions définies. L’interprétation juridique des testaments authentiques fait ainsi apparaitre des problèmes sémantiques intéressants. Même si les juges doivent respecter des contraintes spécifiques, leur raisonnement semble cohérent et explicite, et ne doit pas être ignoré. Leurs conclusions semblent corroborer dans une certaine mesure la théorie sémantique contextualiste.",1,0
"Regional Dialect Labels in Thorndike-Barnhart Dictionaries David K. Barnhart The first dialect dictionary in English is generally attributed toJohn Ray (1674), the father of English natural history and the person largely responsible for the establishment ofan early system for the classification ofplants, adopting the flower as the basis for classifying them into genera and species. Elisha Coles (1676) follows Phillips (1658) in the general vocabulary and in the entry of proper names; he departs from the conventional in including canting terms and dialectal words. These appear in the general list in alphabetical order and are designated by abbreviations explained by Coles in his introduction (Starnes and Noyes 1946, 60). Coles appears to have been the first lexicographer to have ""deliberately chosen to introduce them into a general dictionary"" (Starnes and Noyes 1946, 63). Noah Webster recognized and identified dialects in his An American Dictionary oftheEnglish Language (1828), as at clever: clever, a. — 3. In New England, good-natured, possessing an agreeable mind or disposition. In Great Britain, this word is applied to the body or its movements, in its literal sense .... In New England, a clever man is a man of pleasing, obliging disposition .... It is a colloquial word but sometimes found in respectable writing. This usage may be what SamuelJohnson reported in his great dictionary as: "" ... [4.] This is a low word, scarcely ever used but in burlesque or conversation; and applied to any thing a man likes, without a settled meaning."" In his dictionary of 1846, Joseph E. Worcester reported essentially the same information as had Webster some 20 years earlier. In Dialect Labels in Thorndike-Barnhart Dictionaries139 the 1888 edition of Worcester's abridgment of that earlier work, clever, in the sense of ""obliging,"" is labeled ""[U.S.]."" Nuttall's Standard Dictionary (1891) also labels it U.S. The 1867 edition of A Common-School Dictionary of the English Language, while entering the term clever, together with the meaning cited above, did not label that meaning as regional in any way. Indeed, very few school dictionaries of the 19th century indicated dialect: in consulting dictionaries for school children compiled before the turn of the century — Turner's The School Dictionary (1829), Cobb's (1846), and adaptations of Walker's (1839) dictionary for schools — I find that the editors did not concern themselves with dialect. Turner (1829) in his preface says nothing about it: The study of the dictionary as of late is much neglected in schools. This may have arisen in part from the fact that no dictionary could be obtained, adapted to the wants of schools but the principal reason undoubtedly is this; the system of teaching which prevails in our common schools is fundamentally wrong .... The attention of both teacher and scholar is exclusively confined to letters, words, and sounds; of course ideas are neither communicated or received. Defining, is an exercise rarely attempted in common schools and the dictionary is banished from the school-house .... However, both Webster's Academic Dictionary (1895) and Webster's Secondary School Dictionary (1925) enter clever meaning ""obliging"" and label it ""Dial, or Colloq."" The early Thorndike-Barnhart dictionaries were originally entitled Thorndike Century Dictionaries and were intended as a school series. Later the series was to include The Thorndike-Barnhart Comprehensive Desk Dictionary and was ultimately capped by the World Book Encycbpedia Dictionary (first published in 1963); both were direct outgrowths of the Century tradition. This tradition can find some connection to Ogilvie's The Imperial Dictionary (1850). Roswell Smith, President of the Century Co., had suggested a project that would incorporate a dictionary as described in William Dwight Whitney's (1889) preface, to be ""serviceable for every literary and practical use; a more complete collection of the technical terms ... ; and the addition to the definitions proper of such related encyclopedic matter with pictorial illustrations as shall constitute a convenient book for general reference "" (see Bailey, 1996). And, more specific to the following discussion , Whitney states the importance of considering the inclusion of dialect terms: 140David K. Barnhart The first duty of a comprehensive dictionary is collection, not selection. When a full account of the language is sought, every omission of a genuine English form, even when...",1,0
"Journal of Semantics Advance Access published April 18, 2014 Journal of Semantics, 0, 2014: 1–51 doi:10.1093/jos/ffu004 Measure Phrase Equatives and Modified Numerals Abstract In English, equatives can be formed with a numeral or measure phrase (MP) standard (e.g. John can dive as deep as 500m; Rett, 2010). These ‘measure phrase equatives’ (MPEs) differ semantically from their clausal counterparts (e.g. John can dive as deep as Sue can) in two important ways. First, while clausal standards set lower bounds, resulting in an ‘at least’ interpretation of the equative, MP standards tend to set upper bounds, resulting in an ‘at most’ interpretation. Second, MPEs are restricted in their distribution relative to clausal equatives: they are only acceptable when the subject is associated with a range of values or when the value they’re associated with is signifi- cantly high (or both). The main goal of this paper is a unified analysis of the equative morpheme that accounts for these semantic and distributional differences between clausal and MP equatives. I attribute these differences to the fact that MPEs can trigger two different conversational implicatures: a quantity implicature (because they are less informative than MP comparatives); and a manner implicature, because they are more marked than MP constructions like John can dive 500m (deep). I end by suggesting an expansion of this account of MPEs to modified numerals generally, in particular to the differences between Class A and Class B modifiers (Geurts & Nouwen 2007; Nouwen INTRODUCTION In English, equatives can be formed with a numeral or measure phrase (MP) standard (e.g. John can dive as deep as 500m; Rett 2010). These measure phrase equatives (MPEs) are semantically different from clausal equatives in a number of different ways. I argue here that the difference is best attributed to the fact that MPEs trigger an additional manner implicature, in contrast to clausal equatives, as a result of their relation- ship to MP constructions like John dove 500m (deep). The analysis pro- vides insight into the semantic relevance of manner implicatures; I will argue that it can also inform the discussion of modified numerals (e.g. John read fewer than 3 books) generally. I’ll begin by describing the empirical challenge posed by these measure phrase equatives. Section 1.2 outlines the approach and the organization of the article. s The Author 2014.

"Multilingualism research has predominantly focused on describing the various factors behind multilingual individuals’ beliefs and practices in language learning and teaching. However, language and culture are intrinsically related and how intercultural communicative competence can contribute to this alliance remains relatively unknown. To address this research gap, the current study examined the relationship between plurilingual awareness and intercultural communicative competence together with their experiences in language classrooms. The study was based on Douglas Fir Group’s (2016. A transdisciplinary framework for SLA in a multilingual world. Modern Language Journal, 100(Supplement 2016), 19–47. https://doi.org/10.1111/modl.12301) framework and Deardorff’s (2006. Identification and assessment of intercultural competence as a student outcome of internationalization. Journal of Studies in International Education, 10(3), 241–266) process orientation model, with 265 EFL teacher (pre-service and in-service) participants. In this mixed-method study, data were analysed using several multiple regressions and thematic analyses. Findings indicate that plurilingual awareness is a significant predictor of the relationship between language and culture, and individuals with higher plurilingual awareness have higher intercultural communicative competence. Classroom practices yielded complementary results manifested through a) translanguaging as a motivational practice, b) coping with intercultural tensions, and c) technology in multilingual classrooms. This study has several implications for the multilingual turn in language learning and teaching.",1,0
"This article provides an interpretive analysis of Shona native speakers' use of kinship terms of address as forms of communicative resources to invoke social meanings in non-kin relations. Two types of data were used for the analysis of social meanings: (a) field notes from participant observations taken of naturally occurring interactions in public and private spheres over an eight month period (from September 2001 to May 2002) in and around the city of Harare, Zimbabwe and (b) transcriptions of semi-structured, in-depth interviews conducted with 40 Shona native speakers of varying ages, gender, educational status, occupation and religious affiliation. I demonstrate that the current explanatory address system models are apparently inadequate in their representation of both the complexity and distinctiveness of social meanings. Hence, I advocate the use of more interpretive, ethnographic approaches for the discovery of social meaning.",1,0

"Abstract In this article, we present a qualitative and quantitative comparative account of Final Vowel Loss ( fvl ) in the Bantu languages of the Lower Kasai region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. We argue that this diachronic sound shift rose relatively late in Bantu language history as a contact-induced change and affected adjacent West-Coastal and Central-Western Bantu languages belonging to different phylogenetic clusters. We account for its emergence and spread by resorting to two successive processes of language contact: (1) substrate influence from extinct hunter-gatherer languages in the center of innovation consisting of Bantu B80 languages, and (2) dialectal diffusion towards certain peripheral Bantu B70, C80, H40 and L10 languages.",1,0

"In this article several heteroglossic expressions of language regimes will be presented. To this end, I will succinctly discuss a series of (socio) linguistic issues related to the use of one of the major Indigenous languages in Mexico – namely, Mexicano (Nahuatl) – in its political, ideological and pragmatic arenas. This includes a consideration of Mexicano political economies, entailing a dispute over the politics of representation of Mexicano verbal culture in different ambits in which language plays an outstanding role. Comparing different linguistic politics of interpretation will allow an understanding of antagonistic voices regarding competing (e.g., ethnographic, linguistic) approaches, including different linguists’ and anthropologists’ descriptions vis-à-vis varying actors’ contradictory perspectives on the same or similar facts. These will encompass political, ideological and pragmatic uses and ideologies, in both historical and contemporary domains, including the written and oral worlds.",1,0

"Over the last few decades, an increasing number of scholarly articles and books have been published on language and new media. This article provides a brief overview of socioculturally informed studies on language and new media in addition to providing further directions for future scholarship. In this article, I show that it is promising to take an ethnographic and discourse-centered approach to new media to demonstrate actual discursive practices and performances that are taking place in new media environments. Furthermore, I demonstrate that it is social actors/performers who mediate and negotiate (deploy and play with) various ideologies and semiotic resources in a given discursive encounter to accomplish artful performances. Thus, instead of primarily focusing on the already designed and constructed (a medium and its boundedness), we should focus on social actors and their playful performances. By employing an ethnographic/discourse analytic approach to language and new media, we can look at the circulation of discourses to better understand what new media mean for those who use them and how new media are localized into everyday practices and performances of social actors in their diverse geographical localities.",1,0

本篇研究主要是從語誤語料庫來探討中文詞彙置換的語意關係。從中文詞彙語誤的語意代換中可以大致上證實英語及德語的現象，由此可見跨語言間相似的情形。這其中的相似之處在於詞彙置換語誤通常是與語意的關連度有關。目標與語誤詞彙（target-error words）之間會有相似的語意特徵或者呈現語意學裡分類架構中的關聯性。從五種分類架構中來看，語意並列（coordinate）是最常見的情況，再來就是關聯性（association），對比關係（contrastive）則是最少見的。這樣的研究結果支持了對於兩個詞彙互相置換時，彼此都有一定程度上相似的語意特徵或是共同擁有在情境上的某些特質的證論。中文裡的詞彙錯誤總體來說與國外一些跨語言研究中所得到的結論大致吻合。也就是說，詞彙裡的兩個詞目（lemma）之間的語意關聯即是構成置換錯誤的主因。從中文語誤語料的分布類別可以清楚的看出心理語言學及神經語言學在語言產製時直接及透明的歷程，與詞彙選擇呈現獨立進行的過程。,1,0

"Background: Autistic children show reduced attentional preferences to social stimuli early in development, and these differences have consequences on a range of social domains. One factor that could influence development in those processes is bilingualism. Parents and practitioners frequently voice unfounded concerns that bilingualism could cause delays in autistic children, yet there is little evidence to dispute this idea. While there are studies focusing on the impact of bilingualism on cognition in autistic children, no research has focused on the relationship between bilingualism and social attention. Aims: This study therefore investigated the impact of bilingual exposure on social attention in autistic (n = 33) and neurotypical children (n = 42) aged 6–13 years. Rather than a monolingual/bilingual comparison, participants had varying degrees of bilingual exposure, and exposure was treated as a continuous variable. Participants completed an eye-tracking task measuring visual attention to interacting versus non-interacting human figures. Results: Bilingual exposure did not affect dwell time to interacting or non-interacting figures for the neurotypical or autistic groups. However, there was a three-way interaction between diagnosis, figure type and vocabulary scores on dwell time. Conclusions: Higher vocabulary scores in neurotypical participants was associated with significantly less dwell time to non-interacting stimuli. This is the first study to assess the effects of bilingualism on social attention; here, concerns of bilingualism are not upheld.",1,0

本文旨在對古漢語中的逆向重疊作出描寫。調查表明，古漢語中的此類重疊主要適用於動詞。當一個單音節動詞重複為兩個音節之後，“動作重複”這樣的語義特征便隨即產生。此類重疊亦適用於名詞，不過就其產生途徑而言，其基式原本也是動詞。從語音形式來看，一個單音節動詞的重疊會帶來如下變化：如果基式的韻母（包括所謂介音）對區別特徵﹝圓唇﹞呈正值，那麼，基式前面的重疊部分便會在其相應的位置上呈負值；如果基式的韻母對區別特徵﹝圓唇﹞呈負值，我們所能看到的卻並非所期待的﹝＋圓唇﹞／﹝－圓唇﹞的對立，實際所看到的是一種“無標記／有標記”的對立。此一類型的重疊實乃語音與語義語法交互作用的結果。,1,0

"The purpose of this study is to elucidate various practices for the structuring of images on an ultrasound monitor during prenatal ultrasound examinations. This study focuses on the practices that healthcare providers employ to invite pregnant women to differentiate a gray-tone image on the ultrasound monitor from the image’s background. In sequential environments in which pregnant women display difficulty in differentiating an image on the screen in response to the healthcare provider’s invitation, the healthcare provider employs practices that require additional bodily involvement to structure the images on the screen. Furthermore, on certain occasions, the healthcare provider also points to a particular abdominal location with the ultrasound transducer, which is held against the abdomen to produce the very image being differentiated. This study demonstrates that the image on the ultrasound monitor is intrinsically embodied and spatially (between the screen and the participants’ bodies) and modally (among vocal/auditory, visual, and tactile modes of orientation) distributed. In addition, the study suggests an interaction-organizational ground for an aspect of the ‘personification of the fetus’ through obstetric ultrasound.",1,0

"El trabajo que aquí presentamos tiene dos objetivos fundamentales. El primero es examinar la relación entre la frecuencia de los emojis y sus funciones, pragmáticas y discursivas. El segundo es investigar cómo la frecuencia de uso y su relación con las mencionadas variables (los significados trasmitidos o expresados por las mismas) pueden aportar información relevante sobre la ‘identidad discursiva digital’ de los usuarios. Los resultados del análisis estadístico indican que un emoji aparecerá más frecuentemente, de manera significativa, si representa un elemento no verbal; es usado para mitigar posibles conflictos; expresa ironía y humor; es repetible; y puede ser utilizado tanto por mujeres como por hombres (unisex). En relación con la identidad discursiva digital, es posible señalar que hombres y mujeres utilizan indistintamente aquellos emojis que tienen como objetivo limar posibles conflictos, potenciar lo común y conseguir que, en los chats, se produzca un ambiente cortés, divertido y agradable (condición necesaria). Los hombres, sin embargo, a diferencia de las mujeres, ven determinada parte de sus elecciones por otras razones sociales como la ‘identidad masculina’. Este factor podría explicar, por una parte, un uso menor en general de los emojis, quizás por una supuesta atribución de este código a lo femenino; pero, especialmente, ayuda a entender la ausencia de aquellos emojis (tristeza, miedo, súplica, flores, etc.) de cuyo uso pudiera inferirse algún tipo de debilidad, relacionada hipotéticamente con una ‘identidad femenina’.",1,0

"Darwin's book On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection (henceforth The Origin) abounds with metaphors. In fact, the very theory of natural selection is couched in a system of metaphors that exhibit striking consistency and coherence. I argue that the phenomenon for which Darwin tries to detect the basic mechanisms, that is, biological evolution, involves vast, indeterminate, and ambiguous observations that are difficult to subject to the empirical methods. This fact motivates Darwin's extensive use of metaphors to organize his observations, structure the vague concepts, and ultimately render his observations meaningful and intelligible. I demonstrate that Darwin's metaphors, as far as they are elements of Idealized Cognitive Models, prove valuable in achieving this goal. First, I identify the conceptual metaphors underlying the main metaphorical expressions and show how these conceptual metaphors give rise to entailments and inferences central to Darwin's theory.

"The book under review here represents an attempt towards paradigmatic change in the study of language policy. The attempt – characterized by the editor in terms of Hymes' “ethnographic monitoring” – consists of a series of shifts in objects, assumptions and methodologies. Policy research consists of work on a variety of distributed objects, organized along different scales and operating on a variety of levels and in a variety of modes. This review article organizes these shifts along three axes: (a) understanding language policies as ideological complexes; (b) incorporating history and globalization as crucial “contexts”, enabling a different kind of generalization about dynamic systems; and (c) the introduction of vertical processes of stratification and layering alongside horizontal processes of distribution and presence. Taken together, these shifts offer a new program for ethnographic monitoring.",1,0

"A construction‐integration analysis of the comprehension of causal text sequences was performed. According to the validation analysis, the comprehension of both consistent and inconsistent causal sequences requires that tentative bridging inferences be validated with reference to relevant knowledge. Consistent with this proposal, Singer (1993) reported that people needed less time to answer questions about the hypothesized validating facts after consistent and inconsistent sequences than after control, temporal sequences. The construction‐integration analysis of these effects focused particularly on a central configuration of causally related propositions. The simulations adopted the following assumptions and parameters: (a) There was a working memory buffer size of 1; (b) all link strengths had an absolute value of 1; and (c) the representations included text base and situation model elements, but no surface elements. Sixteen preliminary simulations, applied to 2 text frames each, influenced decisions co...",1,0

"We present in this article a Partial Connection Multilayered Network (PCMN), based on a technique of partial connection between layers. This network can be trained automatically by the gradient back-propagation (GBP) algorithm. A general network based on GBP has been implemented on a ring configuration of the F.P.S. T20 Hypercube. We have made a special effort to ensure an efficient parallelization of this algorithm. This implementation provides us with a large number of possible configurations for our network. In this experiment the network is used to effect isolated word recognition. Results show the advantages of partial connection as against full connection. This technique permits the efficient treatment of temporal information, which is very important in speech processing, unlike image processing. This experiment also permits us to gain a better understanding of network characteristics important for speech processing. Partial connection can introduce both temporal context constraints and some implicit knowledge into the network and may also lead to efficient learning on a small data base. Good recognition results have been obtained. In diesem Artikel stellen wir ein mehrschichtiges, teilweise verbundenes Netzwerk vor. Das selbstlernende Netzwerk basiert auf dem “gradient back-propagation” (GBP) Algorithmus. Ein allgemeines auf dem GBP basierendes Netzwerk wurde in Ring-Konfiguration auf einem F.P.S. T20 Hypercube implementiert. Bei der Programmierung wurde grösstmöglicher Wert auf eine parallele Verarbeitung des Algorithies ermöglicht eine große Anzahl möglicher Konfigurationen für unser Netzwerk. Im hier beschriebenen Experiment wird das Netzwerk zur Erkennung von isolierten Wörtern benutzt. Die Ergebnisse zeigen die Vorteile der tielweisen gegenüber der vollen Vernetzung. Diese Technik ermöglicht die wirksame Verarbeitung von zeitlichen Informationen, welche - im Gegensatz zur Bildverarbeitung - bei Sprachverarbeitung von zentraler Bedeutung sind. Das Experiment erlaubt zudem, die für Sprachverarbeitung relevanten Eigenschaften des Netzwerkes besser zu verstehen. Teilweise verbundene Netzwerk können sowohl zeitabhängige Einschränkungen als auch implizite Kenntnisse im Netz berücksichtigen uun führen zu effizientem Lernen des Netzwerkes bei kleiner Datenmenge. Befriedigende Ergebnisse sind so durch dieses teilweis verbundenes Netswerk erhalten worden. Nous présentons un réseau multicouches à connexion partielle (Partial Connection Multilayered Network, PCMN), fondé sur une technique de connexions partielles et superposées entre les couches. L'apprentissage de ce réseau peut se faire automatiquement par l'algorithme de rétro-propagation du gradient (gradient back-propagation algorithm, GBP). Un réseau général fondé sur GBP a été implanté sur une configuration d' anneau de la machine Hypercube F.P.S. T20. Une parallélisation efficace de l'algorithme a été assurée. Cette implantation a Fourni un éventail de possibilités de configuration du réseau. Dans notre expérience, le réseau a été utilisé pour la reconnaissance de mots isolés. Les résultats montrent les advantages de la technique de connexions partielles par rapport à la connexion compléte. Cette technique permet de traiter efficacement des informations temporelles qui sont trés importantes pour le traitement de la parole, à la différence du traitement d'images. Cette expérience permet aussi de mieux comprende descaracteristiques de réseau dans l'application à la parole. La connexion partielle permet d'introduire des contraintes de contete temporel et des connaissances implicites dans le réseau et peut aussi permettre un apprentissage efficace avec une petite base de données.

"The SAGE Deaf Studies Encyclopedia, ed. Genie Gertz and Patrick Boudreault (Los Angeles: SAGE, 2016, 1,128 pages)pah! Finally, a compendium has been published documenting, within a single source, scholarly knowledge exclusively about Deaf people. Editors Genie Gertz and Patrick Boudreault, their editorial board, and their many contributors and consultants have created a valuable reference that impressively substantiates Deaf studies as a well-developed scholarly discipline. It also compellingly documents the lives of Deaf people as an integral part of the tapestry of both US and world history.The publication of the SAGE Deaf Studies Encyclopedia comes at an opportune time, given the emergence in recent years of numerous undergraduate and graduate programs incorporating topics such as Deaf history, culture, art, literature, and linguistics into their academic curricula. Furthermore, it has been nearly thirty years since a comparable publication, The Gallaudet Encyclopedia of Deaf People and Deafness, edited by JohnV.Van Cleve, was published. Since that time, numerous new developments have occurred in diverse disciplines such as public policy, technology, sign language research, and Deaf rights activism. Furthermore, the ways in which Deaf people currently engage in scholarly discourse about themselves as a distinct cultural and linguistic group encompass multidisciplinary perspectives and is international in scope.The availability of the SAGE Deaf Studies Encyclopedia is also timely, given that one of its ultimate aims is to facilitate the use of more contemporary perspectives and analytical frameworks for talking about and understanding Deaf people and their place in society. In that regard, among the appealing features of the publication are the Deafcentric perspectives exemplified in the various entries.Readers will readily note that the SAGE Deaf Studies Encyclopedia is voluminous. It comprises more than 330 entries spread across 1,070 pages that are organized into three volumes. For scholars and students with extensive knowledge of and involvement in the field of Deaf studies, navigating through the encyclopedia will be a worthwhile and enlightening journey. On the other hand, for those who may be new to or have only rudimentary knowledge of the myriad of topics germane to the field of Deaf studies, navigating through the encyclopedia may be a daunting task. Fortunately, the editors provide some helpful features for both those with extensive knowledge of Deaf studies and those who may have only minimal knowledge of the field.One of the helpful features is the availability of a reader's guide on pages xi-xv in volume 1, which organizes the 330-plus entries into twenty-four major areas. A second helpful feature is an index at the end of volume 3, which provides the entry titles and their volume and page numbers to facilitate the reader's search for topics of interest. A third helpful feature is the use of cross-references to related topics, which are listed at the end of each entry. This feature encourages exploration of diverse perspectives on topics with comparable themes.Additionally, in promotional materials by SAGE Publications announcing the launch of the new encyclopedia, the editors identified four goals for the reference work: (1) to chronicle the exponential growth in the quality of Deaf individuals' lives; (2) to document the history and stories of Deaf lives that are furthering the advancement of Deaf people; (3) to document the countless ways in which the Deaf experience is enhanced by the scholarship of Deaf studies; and (4) to locate Deaf studies as a key field within the broader, formalized area of minority studies. …",1,0

"关于合成复合词 OVN 和 VON 的结构特征及其合法性问题,学界已从形式句法、韵律语法及句法、韵律、语义等多重因素相互作用等方面做了较为丰富的探讨,但目前仍有很大争议。本文试图在学界既有研究的基础上提出新的分析角度,以期对合成复合词各种类型的生成机制及其约束条件做出更为一致性的描写和解释。文章首先系统描写了合成复合词系统复杂多样的组配类型及其合法性、合用性表现,概括了学界关于合成复合词生成条件所讨论的主要方面及有待解决的问题,由此提出基于语体语法基本原理的研究路径。在建构语体语法的时空性原理及其运作规则系统的基础上,文章逐一分析了不同类型合成复合词的合法性和合用性的具体约束条件,并对各种特殊类型和特殊用例的生成动因做出阐释。文章由此提出,对合成复合词的生成机制而言,所谓的例外、特例、反例现象是受到多重互动关系制约的结果;合成复合词的类型学差异受到语言结构特征和特殊语体动因的相互制约,这为建立语体类型学提供了一个很好的参照。文章最后指出,这种基于多重互动关系作用机制的研究,可以启发我们对相关研究的方法论问题做出新的思考。",1,0

"MICHEL FOUCAULT's work on power and subject formation has been extremely useful for key theorists in Deaf studies. In this article analyze the ways that certain theorists, specifically Harlan Lane and Paddy Ladd, utilize Foucault's work to theorize the d/Deaf experience.1 am interested in how and to what ends these two theorists use Foucault. To this end, conduct a close reading of Foucault's work on biopower and subject formation in which outline the emergence of biopower as a distinct rationality of rule and examine the relationship between biopower and subject formation. argue, based upon my reading of Foucault, that these works do not go far enough in looking at the ways that power is not just oppressive but actually productive and that, similarly, subject formation and subject positioning involve constant and fluid processes of give and take, back and forth, struggle and resistance, as well as the living of everyday life. Finally, examine current anthropological works that explore the ways that biopower produces and creates conditions of possibility for the emergence of communities around bios, or life. Inspired by Paul Rabinow's (1996) work, suggest that the Deaf community can be seen as biosociality, as something produced by and through, and not in spite of, the existence of power. In addition, suggest that the Deaf community has developed as a result of a specific form of governance that Nikolas Rose (1999), working through Foucault, calls governing through community. In this sense, echoing anthropologist Jean Comaroff's (2007) work on HIV/ AIDS, suggest that deafness has been productive. As Comaroff writes: I use [productive] in the manner of Marx and Foucault to imply that it has given birth to significant forms of sociality and signification, of enterprise and activism, both negative and positive (ibid., 203). Underlying this article is a commitment to excavating and salvaging the relationship between little d and capital D deafness. How can we begin to understand the slippage and (productive) tension between little d and capital D d/Deafness? In his powerful work The Mask of Benevolence, Harlan Lane (1992) examines the ways that d/Deaf people are medicalized and made to feel that they are abnormal and inferior by hearing people and by medical and educational institutions. Lane sets up a binary relationship between the hearing audist world and the world of the Deaf and illustrates how the former oppresses the latter (and prevents it from becoming). Indeed, Lane's story is very much one of oppression, colonialism, and paternalism, of d/Deaf children forced to wear hearing aids, sit through individualized education program meetings, and attend specialized schools for the deaf. For him, artifacts such as hearing tests, headphones, and hearing aids are symbols of oppression (ibid., 81). Lane's story is also one of loss: He writes about how deaf children's cultural heritage as Deaf people and their innate and natural language, sign language, is denied. He also writes that, as a result of audiological and psychological exams, deaf children are individualized (individually diagnosed and labeled) and that, as a result, the communal nature of the Deaf community as a linguistic and cultural minority is masked (ibid.). And so the question is, how does Lane utilize Foucault's work to further his argument about the ways that hearing people oppress the Deaf community? include four particular treatments of Foucault's work. In examining the ways that the National Association for the Deaf and other Deaf political organizations frequently invoke the 1880 Milan Deaf Education Congress and fight against cochlear implants, Lane writes: Michel Foucault has analyzed the historical evolution in which the control of peoples' bodies came to be seen as a legitimate concern of government. What he calls bio-power extends to reach into our civilization in such diverse fields as criminality, psychiatry, education, and family planning. …",1,0

"Abstract The case is reported of a bilingual (Dutch English) speaking woman who started to stutter after a whiplash trauma. Although the pattern of dysfluency was quite similar in both languages (more dysfluencies in propositional speech than in non-propositional speech; function words and monosyllabic words more affected than content words and polysyllabic words, respectively), stuttering severity differed significantly. The patient had more dysfluencies in her native language. Contrary to what is commonly seen in bilinguals with developmental stuttering, language proficiency was apparently not a determining factor for stuttering severity.",1,0

"In some European countries, indirect or partial legal recognition of sign languages (SLs) has been granted in the last few decades through specific policies on deaf education, SL interpreting, or public media, but, in general, full legal recognition by dedicated laws has not been achieved. I present and analyze the recent legal initiatives for SLs in Spain (2007) and Catalonia (2006, 2010) (Spanish and Catalan SLs, respectively). They are shown to exemplify two different approaches to the reality of minority languages in the visual-gestural modality: The former act formulates SL recognition as part of the regulation of the accessibility means for deaf people, both signers and nonsigners; the latter regulates Catalan SL instead, leaving accessibility issues for deaf people for regulation by a separate bill.",1,0
"摘要 本文通过对含有光杆动宾结构和体标记的汉语非自足句的考察，提出这些句子不合法的原因在于它们都是非限定句。在对非限定句做出的功能定义的基础上，本文指出事件句的时间理解需要三类抽象“时间”，即事件时间（Situation Time, SitT），声称/指称时间（Topic/Reference Time, TT），和说话时间（Utterance Time, UT）。在此基础上，我们进一步指出限定句的骨架的必有成分包括 CP, TP, AspP 和 VP（即 VP-e）。因此，本文讨论的句子之所以不合法，可以归因于骨架的不完整。同时，本文也检验了几种修补该类句子的手段，指出其目的多是加强了谓语的潜在的事件性，以满足限定事件句骨架的需要。由此，本文提出了一种分析汉语非自足句的新的理论框架。",1,0

"The Grand Dictionnaire universel du xixe&#160;si&#232;cle (Great Universal Dictionary of the Nineteenth Century) by Pierre Larousse (1817-1875) is considered to be the reference dictionary of its century.

"El español chocoano (EC) es un vernáculo afrohispánico hablado en las tierras bajas del Pacífico colombiano (Departamento del Chocó). Aunque lingüísticamente similar al español colombiano estándar, las condiciones históricas del Departamento del Chocó parecen haber sido ideales para el desarrollo de una lengua criolla: población blanca reducida, introducción masiva de esclavos, duras condiciones de trabajo, total aislamiento del contexto urbano y de la lengua española. Al respecto, se han propuesto dos hipótesis principales: (1) descriollización y (2) afrogénesis. Analizando la evidencia lingüística y sociohistórica del EC, este trabajo indica que las condiciones no fueron propicias para la formación de un criollo en el Chocó colonial. Por lo tanto, las hipótesis 1 y 2 no reflejan la verdadera naturaleza y evolución de este dialecto. El presente estudio sugiere que el EC puede analizarse como el resultado de procesos avanzados de adquisición de segunda lengua, no implicando necesariamente una etapa criolla previa.",1,0

"AS IS generally known, the unrounding of 'short o,' which began in seventeenth-century England, has produced a considerable range of variation in present-day speech. In southern England the rounded [D] though usually considered standard,1 is often replaced by [a]. In America, the range extends from [a] through [a] and [n] to [v], with additional diphthongal variants in the South. In some categories of the 'short-o' words, the range is minimal: hot, stop, and lockJ except for minor local preferences for [a] or [D], are overwhelmingly pronounced with [a]. On the other hand, words like log, gong, honk, torest>2 and warrant show the full range of variation, some of them with distinct regional patterns. The word on differs from other 'short-o? words in two respects: it has a very frequent unstressed form, generally pronounced somewhat like [an]; its stronger forms show regional variations which do not correspond very closely with those of other 'short-o' words. In order to get at the regional variations I have tested the word chiefly at the ends of such phrases as '... turned the radio on' and '.... time to be getting on,' where at least a moderate degree of stress is normal. I have classiEed the [a] and [a] variations as unrounded; [n] and [v], as rounded, though [D] may often, and [v] occasionally, be produced withoult noticeable liprounding. The [a] variation occurs most frequently in the Ontario watershed in New York, occasionally in the Great Lakes area further west, and spottily as far away from the Lakes as Connecticut and Pennsylvania. Of the rounded varieties, [n] is more frequent in New England; [o], in the South. In the following data, [a] and [a] are recorded as U for unrounded; [D] and [v], as R for rounded: Maine: U 13 instances, R 9 instances, U 59%; New Hampshire: U 19, R 3, U 86%; Vermont: U 99, R 5, U 95%; Massachusetts: U 116, R 3y, U 76%; Rhode Island: 21 instances, all U; Connecticut: U 79, R 1, U 98%; New York: U 1766, R 14, U 99%; northern3 New Jersey: U 320, R 31, U 91%o; southern New Jersey: U 26, R 52, R 67%; northern",1,0

"The term morphome (to be distinguished from morpheme), and the notion that there exist autonomous morphological phenomena synchronically independent of phonological or functional conditioning, has occupied a central place in morphological theory. This article reviews some characteristics of morphomic (i.e., autonomously morphological) structures that are assumed in recent studies. Taking a diachronic perspective, it asks whether these properties (typological uniqueness, phonological heterogeneity, syncretism, systematicity, predictiveness) are inherent or only contingent. It concludes that typological uniqueness is not inherent and that the belief that it is so is a misunderstanding. Phonological heterogeneity, a repeatedly observed concomitant of some of the best-known types of morphome, proves merely contingent since alternations firmly anchored in a particular phonological form can be morphomic. Syncretism may be a precondition for, but is not necessarily characteristic of, the historical emergence of morphomes. Contrary to widely held assumptions, systematicity and predictiveness are acquired (not inherent) characteristics of morphomes.",1,0

"Abstract In 1856, Margaret Garner murdered one child, and attempted to murder three others, rather than return them to slavery. Despite the impact traumas like Garner’s had on abolition, history largely forgets or ignores these gruesome details. In their place come racialist markers that obscure Garner’s likeness. Thomas Satterwhite Noble’s The Modern Medea , for example, depicts Garner with a head wrap and wild eyes. Visual cues such as these perpetuate an undifferentiating representation of Garner, categorized as something between asexual “mammy” and angry “slave.” I argue that Toni Morrison recovers Garner by reconfiguring what Hayden White terms the “historical account” with icons to connote paradoxical significations. Like paradoxes, these icons simultaneously embody complementary and yet oppositional significations without one privileged over the other. Morrison’s historiography thus produces in simultaneity a history told and repealed, which functions iconoclastically not only to engravings such as The Modern Medea but also to the linguistic system that structures an incomplete and surreptitious “historical account.”",1,0

"The article analyzes the impressionistic poetics of Boris Butkevich, a literary figure of the first wave of Russian emigration, a representative of the Harbin literary school. Like most impressionists, the composition of the poetic text by Boris Butkevich lacks a clearly defined beginning and end. The described lyrical situation can theoretically be continued in both directions. The reference points of impressions turn out to be significant, and not their poetic analysis. A similar principle is also found in the author’s prose, which largely repeats and develops the poetics of his lyric poems. Along with repeated melodic tricks in Butkevich’s prose, cross-cutting motives play an important role, passing from one text to another and organizing the unity of the cycle. At the same time, the author maintains the basic principle of impressionistic discourse – the paradoxical inconsistency of the scale of values. The value of an event is determined not by the accuracy of coincidences with the accepted doxes, but by the fact of a random incident of an event in the author’s field of vision.",1,0

"Having decided to lend a hand with the Dictionary of Canadian English, one’s first thought will be to read various items of Canadiana for the purpose of excerpting quotations. In his initial burst of enthusiasm, the volunteer is likely to tackle something on the order of the Publications of the Hudson’s Bay Record Society, Cartwright’s Labrador Journal (1792), Pennant’s Arctic Zoology , Isham’s Observations on Hudson’s Bay (1743), Palliser’s Journals (1863), or files of such pioneer newspapers as the Loyalist (York), Qu’Appelle Vidette , or Bob Edwards’s Calgary Eye Opener . While works like these are ideal sources of citations for the dictionary we envisage their every importance renders them unwise choices for the neophyte. It is not enough to select works of historical value, for mere mechanical examination of the most promising sources cannot be expected to yield optimum results in the absence of a thorough knowledge of the field of inquiry. Not only is there the risk that the unskilled researcher will fail to notice some unfamillar words, illustrative of the life and thoughts of earlier periods, but he may also miss a few common ones. Then, too, he may waste time in collecting irrelevant material. Since the earlier examples of more settled words are ordinarily hardest to locate and, of course more prized, the consequences of an inexperienced researcher overlooking, say, an 1856 example of Confederation (for it was used anticipatively well before 1867) are rather more serious than would be the skipping of more recent words. The products of a disciplined understanding are superior to those of an uncultivated understanding, so it is to our helpers’ advantage to learn as much as possible of the basic principles of lexical research before delving into scarcer source materials.",1,0

"We argue that crosslinguistic variation regarding verbal reflexivization is parametric, reflecting a broader lexicon-syntax parameter: arity operations—operations on θ-roles, which affect the valence of a predicate—can apply in the lexicon or in the syntax. The significant empirical coverage of this parameter supports the view that the lexicon must be an active component of the grammar. The discussion focuses mainly on the formation of reflexive verbs. We argue that the prevailing view that reflexive verbs have an unaccusative derivation cannot be maintained. Rather, the reflexivization operation bundles a θ-role with an external θ-role, forming a combination that must merge externally. Next, we also briefly review other arity operations: (a) reciprocalization, (b) decausativization, and (c) saturation, which is involved in the formation of passives, middles, and impersonals. Variation in auxiliary selection, owing to the application of reflexivization or other arity operations, is independent of the lexicon-syntax parameter and follows under our approach from a structural accusative Case parameter.",1,0

"Of the various subtypes of causal argumentation, one that has been sparking the interest of a large number of scholars across various contexts is pragmatic argumentation. This paper aims at undertaking an exploratory study of discursive indicators of pragmatic argumentation in a synchronic corpus of judgments by the Supreme Court of the United States of America. The study began with a qualitative overview to be followed by a more quantitative investigation, in which discursive indicators of pragmatic argumentation were lemmatized and searched for at a corpus level. Data show both the tendency of lemmas to occur within larger patterns, and the way these are correlated with an outline of both desirable and undesirable consequences the judge may draw the attention to. Findings thus appear to offer food for thought in the three largely interrelated areas of argumentation, discourse studies and legal theory.",1,0

"We present a vector space–based model for selectional preferences that predicts plausibility scores for argument headwords. It does not require any lexical resources (such as WordNet). It can be trained either on one corpus with syntactic annotation, or on a combination of a small semantically annotated primary corpus and a large, syntactically analyzed generalization corpus. Our model is able to predict inverse selectional preferences, that is, plausibility scores for predicates given argument heads. We evaluate our model on one NLP task (pseudo-disambiguation) and one cognitive task (prediction of human plausibility judgments), gauging the influence of different parameters and comparing our model against other model classes. We obtain consistent benefits from using the disambiguation and semantic role information provided by a semantically tagged primary corpus. As for parameters, we identify settings that yield good performance across a range of experimental conditions. However, frequency remains a major influence of prediction quality, and we also identify more robust parameter settings suitable for applications with many infrequent items.",1,0

"There are often practical barriers to doing fieldwork in a novel, remote location. I propose a model for linguistic research designed to overcome such barriers: a linguistic field station. It is a centralized facility that coordinates scientific research by providing (i) research infrastructure, (ii) access to specific social, biological, or ecological systems that are not immediately available otherwise, (iii) training for students at the graduate and undergraduate levels, and (iv) access to local communities with the goal of obtaining data from them as well as training local specialists. Field stations are particularly important for research on and documentation of Indigenous languages, including contexts where colonial languages are supplanting Indigenous ones. Although the field station model is not new in research outside of language sciences, it has not yet been utilized widely in language research. I describe how the proposed model has been implemented in Guatemala and compare the field station there with other linguistic field stations.",1,0

"In this study, we present improvements in N-best rescoring of code-switched speech achieved by n-gram augmentation as well as optimised pretraining of long short-term memory (LSTM) language models with larger corpora of out-of-domain monolingual text. Our investigation specifically considers the impact of the way in which multiple monolingual datasets are interleaved prior to being presented as input to a language model. In addition, we consider the application of large pretrained transformer-based architectures, and present the first investigation employing these models in English-Bantu code-switched speech recognition. Our experimental evaluation is performed on an under-resourced corpus of code-switched speech comprising four bilingual code-switched sub-corpora, each containing a Bantu language (isiZulu, isiXhosa, Sesotho, or Setswana) and English. We find in our experiments that, by combining n-gram augmentation with the optimised pretraining strategy, speech recognition errors are reduced for each individual bilingual pair by 3.51% absolute on average over the four corpora. Importantly, we find that even speech recognition at language boundaries improves by 1.14% even though the additional data is monolingual. Utilising the augmented n-grams for lattice generation, we then contrast these improvements with those achieved after fine-tuning pretrained transformer-based models such as distilled GPT-2 and M-BERT. We find that, even though these language models have not been trained on any of our target languages, they can improve speech recognition performance even in zero-shot settings. After fine-tuning on in-domain data, these large architectures offer further improvements, achieving a 4.45% absolute decrease in overall speech recognition errors and a 3.52% improvement over language boundaries. Finally, a combination of the optimised LSTM and fine-tuned BERT models achieves a further gain of 0.47% absolute on average for three of the four language pairs compared to M-BERT. We conclude that the careful optimisation of the pretraining strategy used for neural network language models can offer worthwhile improvements in speech recognition accuracy even at language switches, and that much larger state-of-the-art architectures such as GPT-2 and M-BERT promise even further gains.",1,0

提要 本研究針對華語單音節詞和雙音節詞的一聲（陰平）和四聲（去聲），對華語中級程度的 25 位越南學生進行聲調偏誤調查，並嘗試分析出系統性偏誤模式。前人研究多僅考察「發音」、「聽辨」偏誤，本研究加入「記憶」偏誤調查，用以排除「發音」偏誤中的「記憶」偏誤因素。由調查結果推論：前人研究對於越南學生發音和聽辨能力孰優孰劣之不同的研究結果，可能與研究測得的發音偏誤是否牽涉記憶偏誤因素有關。本研究調查發現：聲調「記憶」部分的偏誤率最高，其次為「聽辨」，再其次為「發音」，三者偏誤率之間皆達到統計上之顯著相關。「聽辨」影響「記憶」，「記憶」又進而影響「發音」，三者息息相關。偏誤模式方面，「聽辨」和「記憶」的模式高度一致，皆為一聲偏誤率最高，四聲次之，一聲或四聲居雙音節詞前字時，偏誤率高於居後字。「發音」則是四聲偏誤率最高，一聲次之，四聲居雙音節詞前字時，偏誤率比居後字高，但一聲居前字時，偏誤率比居後字低。,1,0

"Some may find it strange to see a special journal issue on monolingualism. After all, is it not bilinguals and multilinguals who present the more interesting questions? It certainly seems so, for research has concentrated on their linguistic, psycholinguistic and sociolinguistic make-up. The implication of this is that monolingualism is the norm, and that bilingualism and multilingualism constitute abnormal states which merit investigation; even though this idea sits oddly with the belief of most linguists that the majority of the world’s population is bi- or multilingual, and that therefore monolingualism may be the exception rather than the norm. There is little systematic investigation of monolingualism: Romaine pointed out in 1995 that she would find it strange to see a book with the title ‘Monolingualism’. This special issue of Sociolinguistic Studies carries just such a title, and the papers it includes represent an attempt to explore the phenomenon of monolingualism from a number of different perspectives. In this introduction I will outline why a simple definition of monolingualism is neither easy to establish nor useful, and also why it is important to come to an understanding of it as a particular kind of ‘lingualism’ (Cruz Ferreira p.c.). I then review ways in which monolingualism has been represented thus far in the literature, outline some possible research questions and end by introducing the contributions to this volume.",1,0

"El Poliodorus de Iohannes de Vallata es una de las comedias humanisticas latinas mejor logradas, pese a los solo diociocho anos que su autor tenia cuando la escribio. Conservada en un solo manuscrito, del que es depositaria la Biblioteca Colombiana de Sevilla, la pieza fue publicada por primera vez el ano 1953, por Jose Maria Casas Homs. Esta primera edicion, sin embargo, adolece de muchos y graves defectos, como lo hizo ver Maria Rosa Lida el ano 1956 en una detallada resena. Alli mismo, la estudiosa propuso una serie de enmiendas al texto establecido por Casas, la mayoria acertadas, a pesar de no estar fundadas en la observacion directa del manuscrito. Posteriormente, en 1963, Mario Ferreccio se doctoro con una tesis sobre el Poliodorus. En este trabajo, luego de un amplio estudio introductorio, Ferreccio ofrece la primera traduccion al espanol de la comedia, hecha siguiendo el texto establecido por Casas, pero corregido principalmente de acuerdo con las observaciones de M.R. LIDA. En el contexto de estos trabajos, pues, mi intencion es proponer aqui algunas notas criticas al texto del Poliodorus, elaboradas a partir de una nueva lectura del codice en que se nos ha trasmitido la comedia.",1,0

"• Consecutive interpreting yields greater activity than simultaneous interpreting. • CI output entails significantly fewer adjective occurrences than SI output. • Lexical category bias appears in language processing under extreme cognitive load. • This bias reflects a synergetic mechanism between language and cognition. While previous results based on quantitative approaches to interpreting output have evidenced distinctive lexical, syntactic and language sequence features across interpreting types as a result of processing differences, none of them has probed into the lexical category realm. In this paper, the activity index, a normalized ratio between verb and adjective occurrences in the text, was used to capture the lexical-category-related patterns across output texts of three interpreting types, namely, simultaneous interpreting (SI), consecutive interpreting (CI) and read-out translated speech (TR). The results showed that the CI outputs yielded greater activity than the SI outputs due to lower frequencies of adjectives in the former. The discrepancy remained significant when differences in activity of input, text size and average sentence length were controlled for, suggesting processing differences as the chief factor underlying this lexical category bias. Given the syntactic priority of verbs over adjectives, the striking loss of adjectives from CI processing probably derives from “underestimated” cognitive demands in CI, which may exceed those in SI. Our research captures a lexical category bias in language processing under extreme cognitive pressure, and this biased language behaviour may reflect a dynamic adaptive mechanism of language representations to accommodate cognitive constraints.",1,0

"LINGUISTIC TAXONOMY: DENSITY OF LANGUAGE SUBGROUPS, GROUPS AND FAMILIESSummaryLanguage subgroups, groups, families and unities were investigated from the point of view of their dispersion in the way it was first proposed in (Тамбовцев 1986). We consider how compact this or that language taxon (i.e. subgroup, group, family or unity) on the basis of distribution of certain consonantal groups in the speech sound chain. Therefore, one can speak about a compact or disperse language family. If language taxon is compact, then its internal connections are shorter than its outer connections. Actually, the same notion of compact object is accepted in pattern recognition. The more compact the family, the more correctly its languages are chosen. If we put in the family a language, which does not belong to the family, then the dispersion of the family rises, thus it becomes less compact. If the language has a similar sound chain, then the dispersion of the group remains the same or becomes less. It means that the family became more compact. In this case we speak about the typological properties of the families. We measure the dispersion of a family by the sum of dispersions of 8 phonostatistical features: frequency of occurrence of labial, front, palatal, velar, sonorant, occlusive, fricative and voiced consonants. It is important that the features do not intersect.The values of the coefficient of variance (V) and T coefficient show the degree of dispersion. The principle is the greater the dispersion, the less compact the family.We have chosen the coefficient of variance and T coefficient since they both keep to the law of commensurability. Comparing different languages of different language families and different morphological structures was possible since all of them have the same 8 phonetic features mentioned above. We have considered Indo-European, Turkic, Mongolian, Tungus-Manchurian, Samoyedic, Finno-Ugric, Paleo-Asiatic, Austronesian, Australian and American Indian language families. The most compact is Mongolian (V = 10.78%; T = 0.08), the least compact is Austronesian (V = 46.21%; T = 0.90). Tungus-Manchurian (V = 17.41%; T = 0.20) is more compact than Samoyedic (18.29%; T = 0.16), Turkic (18.77%; T - 0.21), Indo-European (V = 28.00%; T = 0.61) or Paleo-Asiatic (V = 33.89%; T = 0.46). Language groups are more compact than language families. Iranian group (V = 13.21%; T = 0.09) of Indo-European language family is the most compact, the least compact is Romanian (V = 26.25%; T= 0.33). Slavonic group (V = 15.21%; T = 0.17) is more compact than Indo-Arien (V = 20.40%; T = 0.23) or Germanic (V = 24.51%; T = 0.29). Volga group of the Finno-Ugric language family (V = 17.90%; T = 0.13) is more compact than Ugric (V = 27.66%; T = 0.47) or Finnic (V = 29.24%; T = 0.35) group. Altaic super-family is rather compact (V - 25.97%; T - 0.45). It is more compact than Indo-European (V = 28.00%; T = 0.61) or Paleo-Asiatic family (V = 33.89%; T = 0.46). This fact supports those linguists who consider Altaic as a family, not a super family. Uralic super family is less compact than that (V = 28.31%; T = 0.47), though it is more compact than Balkan (V = 29.74%; T = 0.36) language unity (Sprachbund). Ural-Altaic language unity (V = 30.98%; T = 0.88) is more (much more) compact than American Indian (43.37% 1.07) language unity. Measuring the typological density of language taxons (subgroups, groups, families, unities) may help to understand how natural (or correct) these taxons are.",1,0

"La notion de denomination appartient au paysage de la semantique lexicale, en France, depuis le debut des annees 80. Son implantation problematique est liee d’une part au contexte de sa reception et notamment a la pregnance du paradigme immanentiste dans la description linguistique. Un autre facteur important est le perimetre de la notion elle-meme, telle qu’elle a ete introduite. Nous montrerons que la denomination caracterise une propriete semiotique fondamentale du signe linguistique, mais qu’elle doit faire l’objet d’un reexamen pour donner la mesure de son efficience descriptive. Dans une premiere partie, nous reviendrons sur l’implicite theorique auquel cette notion est adossee et, notamment, sa relation avec le processus de lexicalisation.

"Abstract Unlike Korean or Vietnamese adoptees who came to the U.S. during the postwar era, Chinese adoptees are mostly abandoned female infants under China’s one-child policy from 1980 through 2015. Little work has documented Chinese adoptees’ identity (trans)formation across time and space. This study examines how three Chinese adoptees from the U.S. who chose to go to Taiwan to teach English make sense of their Chinese heritages and their lives in and out of Asia. Drawing on the frameworks of positioning and chronotopic identities, this cross-sectional, multiple case study documents the participants’ identity (trans)formations through their narratives on their moves across the U.S., China, and Taiwan during different points of their lives. Our adoptee participants’ home and work experiences over time represent diverse pathways for their negotiations of various aspects of their identities – linguistic, cultural, Chinese, American, Asian American, and adoptee – in their life trajectories transnationally. Their diverse experiences complicate current understandings of adoptee identities within and across the adoptive home, the “homeland” of their birth places, and beyond.",1,0

"Elsewhere in this volume,' Richard Zettler has presented indisputable evidence for what was probably the most common method of securing doors in ancient Mesopotamia. Doors were secured on the outside by cords tied to doorknobs or pegs, or latch-hooks placed over doorknobs or pegs. The knobs or pegs were held in place by a plaque attached to the wall. For further security, this simple locking device could be covered with a clay sealing. Doors were probably secured on the inside by bars or bolts. I believe that Zettler's discovery of this system of securing doors can elucidate a troublesome tablet in the omen series gumma alu which has not been well understood in the past. Tablet IX of gumma alu2 deals with the securing of doors. It is divided into four nearly identical sections each dealing with doors in different locations. The first section deals with doors in the temple of a god, the second with doors in the temple of a goddess, the third with doors in the palace, and the fourth and final section with doors in the house of a man. The first three sections have nine omens each and the fourth has eleven. These thirty-eight omens are followed by four short namburbis which are probably intended for the four different locations mentioned in the omens. The doors appear to have been secured by means of a hook and eye device, i.e., a latch-hook placed over a doorknob, covered by a clay sealing. The omens are derived from what the diviner observes when the sealed door is opened. He looked at the broken sealing to ascertain if the door had been properly secured or if it had been tampered with. This procedure is not explicit in the text, but is inferred from the context of the protases and from the fact that many of the apodoses deal with what is found or what happens when the door is opened. Most of the protases are broken, but many of them refer to missing possessions or treasures, burglaries, scorpion bites, etc. Most of the problems in understanding this tablet lie in our interpretation of four difficult lexical items: sikkatu, namzaqu, uppu, and alkuttu.",1,0

La naturaleza del instrumento de elicitacion utilizado permitio predecir tres problemas centrales en esta tarea reformulativa: el paso de un tipo de texto a otro (de un dialogo a una narracion), la insercion de un tiempo pasado anterior al pasado enunciativo narrativo y el uso del discurso referido. La tarea fue realizada por ninos de 5, 7, 9 y 11 anos. El analisis permitio encontrar cuatro tipos diferentes de producciones textuales que se corresponden con cuatro estrategias diferentes de textualizacion.

提要 南亚裔人士移居香港主要缘于英国的百年贸易和殖民地统治。面对南亚裔人口的急剧增加，但南亚裔学生却因汉语能力欠佳而较难升读大学，南亚裔学生的汉语教学遂成为香港当今最重要的教育议题之一 。近年不少学者已明确指出，南亚裔中学生的汉语学习困难以 “写” 为最，“读”次之。但有关香港的南亚裔小学生的汉语学习困难仍然没有定论。本文通过测试、访谈、观课，比较 4 个地区 5 所学校 32 位香港南亚裔小三学生在写作和阅读方面的表现，又透过访谈、观课考查 10 位研究对象的汉语朗读问题。结果发现对于已掌握一定写字能力的学生而言，在阅读方面较写作有更大的 “隐忧”，而朗读由于不是 “听、说、读、写”的日常考试范围，在小学阶段没有“朗读”考试，所以更容易被忽略。文章最后提出一些改善南亚裔学生阅读和朗读表现的建议方法，希望能有效提升第二语言教师对学生这两方面“潜伏”困难的注意力，解决学生在阅读和朗读方面遇上的学习困难。,1,0

"The discursive model of pre-translation analysis of international legal discourse relies on interrelated modules: the document conceptual space, with the harmonized value opposition between the concepts of ""legal justice"" and ""compensatory justice"", ""common good"" and ""sovereignty""; the discourse addresser / addressee, embodied in the metonymic nomination ""parties of the document""; the translator as an intermediate system, the semiospheres; extra-textual internalized realities. ""Unifying"" modules include semiospheres of international universal and basic branch documents, as well as universal human values and a shared internalized reality. The shared values underpin basic discursive strategies of consensus, solidarity, cooperation, marked by explicit and implicit intertextual means and additional strategies for minimizing imposition and hiding differences, implemented with tactics of generalization, mitigation and declarativeness based on passivation, nominalization, ""marked theme"", etc. Separating modules include semiospheres of the parties national legislations, marked by ""without prejudice"" clauses, metonymic nominations of ""sovereign power"", hedges scaling down the directive modality and idiomatic references to ""public safety"", etc.; semiospheres of recursive and procursive international branch texts that could be interpreted as conflicting with the document and are involved by 'non-affection' clauses and constative speech acts to fix the supremacy of one document over another. The document conceptual space may reflect the diverging interests and values of the parties, derived from implicit opposition between ""legal justice"" and ""compensatory justice"", harmonized by the documents. The markers of the ""separating"" modules are aimed at a combined strategy for predicting variable interpretation of particular norms with an indication of its source and normative harmonization.

"The notion that digital games can be effectively employed as tools for learning and teaching has steadily been gaining traction among educational theorists and researchers, with numerous empirical studies pointing to the potential benefits of games for skill and knowledge development. However, a solid understanding of learners’ attitudes and concerns regarding this relatively novel pedagogical approach is also necessary for effective implementation in formal learning contexts. It cannot be taken for granted that today’s learners will accept game-based approaches simply because these learners tend to be more accustomed to advanced technologies than those of previous generations. The aim of this mixed-methods empirical study is thus to help elucidate learner beliefs and attitudes regarding digital game-based language learning with survey data collected from 112 undergraduate student participants at a large public university in Japan. The findings reveal that learners generally held positive attitudes towards DGBLL before taking part in any intervention and, after playing a cooperative digital game over six weekly sessions, reported stronger positive attitudes towards this pedagogical approach. In contrast to the results of earlier studies, gender was not found to be a statistically significant predictor of attitude towards DGBLL in this sample. However, two other demographic factors, namely information technology literacy and digital gaming experience, correlated positively with several measures of attitude. The learners considered enjoyment to be the most important advantage of using digital games for language learning. However, many also expressed doubts regarding the effectiveness of game-based language education.",1,0

"This study analyzes attitudinal positioning in academic and media discourse pertaining to COVID-19 from the COVID-19 Corpus and Coronavirus Corpus, using a discourse dynamics approach. Underpinning this approach is the Complex Dynamic Systems Theory (CDST), which we employ to examine the discursive practices of a discourse event across time periods (timescales). The analysis identified significant differences in attitudinal markers and noteworthy developmental patterns in attitude positioning; the developmental trajectories of attitude construction were characterized by a nonlinear developmental pattern subject to fluctuations and variability. We also discerned the existence of dynamic interaction between the uses of attitudinal markers and the reported cases of COVID-19. Methodologically, we demonstrate how the integration of the discourse dynamics approach with corpus linguistics strengthens the social contextualization of data by enabling the identification of developmental patterns of targeted language features over time, and the interconnections of these language features with contextually important social factors.",1,0

"Selon une definition de R.-L. Wagner* x, une attitude normative « implique que l'on ait discerne des niveaux entre plusieurs manieres de s'exprimer, hierarchise ces niveaux et confere a l'un d'eux la dignite de modele » (p. 37). On peut, apres avoir donne des faits de langue une description rendant compte de tous les usages, accorder, de maniere explicite , « une valeur privilegiee a certains types d'expression » (ibid., p. 45), ou bien, et c'est alors que l'attitude normative entre en conflit avec une demarche scientifique, le choix d'un usage parmi d'autres se fait implicitement , tronquant au depart la description de la langue qui ne sera de ce fait que la description de cet usage particulier.

"Linguists engaged in language documentation and sociolinguistics face similar problems when it comes to efficiently processing large corpora of recorded speech. Though field recordings can be collected efficiently, it may take months or years to process the audio for certain types of Besides transcription, phonetic analysis often requires the time-consuming alignment of transcription to audio. The expense related to this process may limit both the questions researchers can explore and the amount of data they can analyze. Recent advances in speech recognition technology have led to the development of tools to automate time alignment of transcriptions to audio (Evanini, Isard, and Liberman 2009, Goldman 2011, Kisler, Schiel, and Sloetjes 2012, Reddy and Stanford 2015, Rosenfelder 2013). Such automation promises to expedite the process of preparing data for acoustic Unfortunately, the benefits of auto-alignment have generally been available only to researchers studying majority languages like English, for which large corpora exist and for which acoustic models have been created by large-scale research projects or corporate entities. Prosodylab-Aligner (Gorman, Howell, and Wagner 2011), developed at McGill University and available free of charge, was developed specifically to facilitate automated alignment and segmentation for less-studied languages. It allows researchers to train their own acoustic models using the same audio files for which alignments will be created. Those models can then be used to create Praat Textgrids aligned to those recordings, with boundaries marked at both the word and segment level. Our study tests the use of Prosodylab-Aligner on Tongan field recordings. The results show that automated alignment of recordings of an understudied language is feasible for linguists without programming experience and less time-consuming than traditional manual alignments. For the benefit of others who may wish to use Prosodylab-Aligner for their own research data, the paper also reviews the software, and outlines the steps required to install software components, prepare data files, train acoustic models, and create time-aligned Textgrids. It also provides tips and solutions to problems we encountered along the way. In addition, since field recordings often contain more background noise than the kinds of laboratory recordings Prosodylab-Aligner was designed to use, the paper also presents an analysis (using PraatR (Albin 2014)) of the relative costs and benefits of removing background noise for both training and alignment purposes.

"The current situation is marked by a negative attitude of people towards politics and division between them. The author shows how we can understand the nature and origin of such a condition with the help of Rosa’s resonance theory and his theory of action. Rosa interprets the modern situation as alienation between people and politics and as a reaction of people to it. On this basis, the author explains the functioning of the politics of fear. He shows that the foundation of the fight against the politics of fear is to improve our relationships in terms of resonance. The author concludes that Rosa’s theory is very useful for understanding the central social and political problem of the modern world, the division between people and politics, which is also a major problem for democracy. Therefore, discussing this theory, elaborating it, applying it and developing it is very relevant and beneficial.",1,0

"This paper examines a puzzle pertaining to the distribution of covalued nominal expressions in two understudied Mayan languages, Chuj and Ch’ol. While Ch’ol behaves entirely as expected with regards to the binding conditions, Chuj appears to consistently tolerate violations of Condition C, often privileging linear precedence as the determining factor in the distribution of R-expressions and pronouns. The Chuj data therefore initially seem to cast doubt on a long tradition to treat the binding conditions as universal (e.g., Grodzinsky and Reinhart 1993, Reuland 2010, 2011). I argue that the difference between Chuj and Ch’ol can be largely explained if, contrary to Ch’ol, Chuj exhibits ‘high-absolutive’ syntax, independently proposed to account for a number of morphosyntactic phenomena in a subset of Mayan languages (Coon et al. 2014; Coon et al. 2021). High-absolutive syntax creates configurations in which the internal argument asymmetrically c-commands the external argument, bleeding otherwise expected binding relations from the external argument into the internal argument. The violations of Condition C in Chuj are thus only apparent. I further argue (i) that linear precedence effects in Chuj are a reflex of a more general anti-cataphora constraint on free nominals, which can also be shown to apply to Ch’ol, and (ii) that there are corners of Chuj where the binding conditions do apply, and that in such cases linear precedence is irrelevant for the distribution of covalued nominals. This means that the binding conditions are active in Chuj, even though idiosyncratic syntactic properties of the language often render their application impossible. The general lesson is that despite initial evidence to doubt the universality of the binding conditions, a universalist approach not only can be maintained, but is supported by the Chuj data.",1,0

"FORUMUsing OED Evidence Julie Coleman (bio) Introduction The papers in this special issue are united by three main themes. The first is their fascination with the wealth of evidence available within the Oxford English Dictionary (OED). This evidence tells us about the history of words and about the creativity and influence of authors and works, but also about wider cultural history and the history of the OED itself. Second, these papers explore the complexities involved in using and interpreting that evidence. Finally, they ask whether the evidence provided is misleading to unwary users of the OED. Can we expect a work of scholarship to draw attention to its own limitations? The history of the OED The OED is a monumental account of the history of the lexis of English, rightly celebrated as the work that “has stolen the high ground of lexicography” (Holder 2004, 226). The first edition (originally called The New English Dictionary, but here referred to as OED1) appeared painstakingly slowly in fascicles between 1884 and 1928, using evidence provided by volunteer readers and supplemented by dictionary staff. The first supplement (OEDS1), published in 1933, added new words and senses for which evidence had come to light during the process of compiling the first edition. Brewer (2007) has demonstrated that work on the dictionary did not cease at this point, even though the next instalment in OED history did not appear until the second supplement [End Page 1] (OEDS2), between 1972 and 1986. According to its publicity, Burchfield’s supplement righted the narrowly British focus of earlier editors (but see Ogilvie 2008a; 2012; Shea, this issue). Until 1989, an OED-user wishing to undertake a thorough review of the dictionary’s coverage of a specific word had to consult three separate alphabetical listings. This was rectified by the publication of OED2, which brought OED1 and the two supplements together in a single alphabetical listing. An electronic edition of OED2 appeared on CD-ROM in 1992 (see Jucker 1994), followed by OED Online in 2000 (see Brewer 2004). OED Online combines partially re-edited material from OED1 and OED2, new senses listed in the Additions Series (OEDAS) during the 1990s, and entirely new material that has never been published in hard copy. Newly edited entries are now labelled as “OED Third Edition”, but it is unlikely that the third edition will ever achieve the fixity of form that is characteristic of the earlier hard copy editions. Using OED evidence The history of the OED will already be familiar to readers of this journal and the subject has, entirely appropriately, received a great deal of scholarly attention, ranging from partisan (Murray 1977) to polemical (Willinsky 1994) and from archival (Mugglestone 2005) to sensational (Winchester 2003). This special issue is not about the history of the OED per se, but rather about the use of its contents as evidence. At its simplest level, the evidential use of OED is represented by the quotation of its etymology, definition or earliest citation date in support of an argument. For example, in this newspaper account of a disagreement between India and Sri Lanka, part of an OED definition (though not the most relevant one) is quoted to challenge a political position: The Oxford English Dictionary defines an Agreement as, “a MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING”. It is common knowledge and a well known principle in Law that any agreement entered into between two parties, whether it be between sovereign nations or between two individuals should have the consent of both parties. (“Agreement signed under duress” 2013). Here the OED adds authority to the argument: if the OED says that agreements must be mutual, then the contested position cannot be characterized as an agreement. In this case, the writer is citing an entry that has been revised for OED3, but older entries are also used in similar ways. For example, in a transcript from television news, Lou Dobbs (2013) [End Page 2] cites the OED definition for coup with reference to recent events in Egypt, arguing that anything described as a coup is, by definition, illegal. In this case, the definition has not been updated since 1893 and therefore does not reflect the current use of this...",1,0

"The aim of this study is to uncover experimentally the acoustic characteristics of the noise source for voiceless fricatives by removing the filtering effects of the vocal tract through inverse filtering . The acoustic transfer functions between glottis and lips were measured experimentally for two subjects while they silently articulated six different sustained voiceless fricatives ([f, θ, s, ∫, ç, x]). The method involves the transcutaneous excitation of the vocal tract with white noise and the estimation of the spectrum of the pressure signal picked up at the lips. Corresponding sound spectra measurements were also made. In addition, conventional midsaggital X-ray pictures of the vocal tracts were obtained for the subjects during the sustained production of the same fricatives. These provided a first estimate of the corresponding area functions, which were then refined using sensitivity functions in order to achieve the best match between the measured transfer functions and the simulated ones. The location of the source was estimated from the frequency of the zeros detected in the sound spectra, and the transconductance was computed. Finally, the spectrum of the source was obtained by subtracting the transconductance from the sound spectrum. A clear mapping was also established between the different peaks measured in the sound spectra or transfer functions and the different cavities, especially in relation to front/back cavity coupling through the constriction channel.",1,0

"IN AND near New York City, trucks are sometimes seen bearing inscriptions that have no apparent direct relation to the businesses in which they are employed. Three broad classes of inscriptions may be distinguished: names of persons; names that would seem applicable to the trucks themselves; and more or less perky proclamations and mottoes. Almost all the inscriptions which I have observed (mainly in the year preceding February, 195I) were on the front of the body or of the driver's cab, on the front bumper, or on the motor hood. The question may be raised: What is the linguistic function of such inscriptions? Or it might be restated: What is the nature of the satisfactions derived from them? Speculation on this question can best wait for a survey of the specimens on hand. Information about the references of the inscriptions is not available; hence the classification attempted here is speculative and based on indecisive internal evidence. A number of the names could fit into more than one of the categories adopted. One frequent type of inscription suggests reference to the drivers of the trucks:' Ralph E. (Italian Shipping Company),2 Tony (Tudor Carting Company), Eugene, Arthur, Joey, Sandy, Stoney, Joe, Popeye, 'Johnny,' 'Bub,' 'Muggsie' (Roadway Express, Inc.), 'Joe,' 'Tommy,' 'Arthur,' 'Cocomo Joe' (Manghise & Son). Perhaps the whole truck crew was memorialized on a vehicle of the Corrieri Carting Company, where Johnny, Ray, and Vickie were spaced out on the bumper. A truck of the Horton Wiping Materials Company put a question: Charlie? Reference to children is suggested in some names: Baby Anne, Baby Lawrence, Master Herbert (Murman's Express), Master Billy, Master Allan, Master Jerald (Wilmohr Trucking Company, Brooklyn), Steven-Alen (Joe Kleban Trucking Company), Miss Ellin (Grossman's Brooklyn-New York Express), Miss Rose Marie, Miss Toni (Remsen Trucking Company), Steven, Michael Jr.",1,0

"Abstract One of the challenges for Cognitive Linguistics in charting the role of conceptualizations in the human world is how to address the frontier between social and cognitive dimensions of those processes that depend on conceptualization. The case that forms the topic of this paper is the conceptualization of rationality, including specifically rational decision-making in relation to economic dilemmas. I am going to take up the concept of rationality with a view to highlighting the connections between on the one hand its complex conceptual structure and on the other hand its complex societal role, focusing on a crucial context, that of determining and implementing economic policy.",1,0

"Interest continues in a class of robustness algorithms for speech recognition that exploit the notion of uncertainty introduced by environmental noise. These techniques share the property that the uncertainty varies with the noise level and is propagated to the decoding stage, resulting in increased model variances. In observation uncertainty forms, the uncertainty variance is simply the variance of the error in enhancement that is added to the model variances. Another form, called uncertainty decoding, refers to a factorisation which results in a linear feature transform and model variance bias that increases with noise; using appropriate approximations, efficient implementations may be obtained, with the goal of achieving near model-based performance without the associated computational cost. Unfortunately, uncertainty decoding forms that compute the uncertainty in the front-end and pass this to the decoder may suffer from a theoretical problem in low signal-to-noise ratio conditions. This report discusses how this fundamental issue arises, and demonstrates it through two schemes: SPLICE with uncertainty and front-end joint uncertainty decoding (FE-Joint). A method to mitigate this for FE-Joint compensation is presented, as well as how SPLICE implicitly addresses it. However, it is shown that a model-based joint uncertainty decoding approach does not suffer from this limitation, like these front-end forms do, and is more computationally attractive. The issues described and performance of the various schemes are examined on two artificially corrupted corpora: the AURORA 2.0 digit string recognition and 1000-word Resource Management tasks.",1,0

"The Relationship of Umiray Dumaget to Other Philippine Languages Ronald S. Himes Abstract Most scholars who have addressed the problem of categorizing Philippine languages have related Umiray Dumaget (DGTU) most closely to other languages spoken by Negritos in northeastern Luzon, languages in the Cordilleran microgroup. Reid (1994) suggests that DGTU is not a Cordilleran language but rather that it is relatable to Bikol, a Central Philippine language. While the evidence from phonological changes and the pronominal system does not compel us to favor one subgrouping over the other, the lexical data do show that DGTU is most closely related to the Central Philippine languages. Culturally, we can infer that DGTU results from very early contact between the non-Austronesian-speaking Negrito population and speakers of that variety of Central Philippine that evolved into Tagalog, Bikol, and the Bisayan languages. A consequence of this grouping is that any inherited lexeme that DGTU shares with non-Central Philippine languages must be assigned to a higher level. 1. Background.1 East Central Luzon is the homeland of the group of about 3,000 people speaking Umiray Dumaget (DGTU). ""Dumagat"" is an exonym applied to a wide variety of groups of the Negrito physical type, most of whom prefer the term Agta, Alta, Ayta, or some other derivative of the Proto-Philippines (PPH(Z)) *qaRta[ ] 'person'.2 Local names for the group in question abound—tagi kellogen, tagi bulus, tagi kabuluwen, tagi depoynga, and so forth—but the designation Umiray has most often been used in the literature (Macleod 1972, McFarland 1980, Walton 1979, Thomas and Gieser 1973, Reid 1994). This language covers a relatively wide area of eastern Luzon from southern Aurora, just south of Baler, along the coast to at least Infanta in Quezon, and westward [End Page 275] into Nueva Ecija, Bulacan, and Rizal provinces. Some speakers of this language are found in communities along the northern coast of Polillo Island (Reid, pers. comm.). There is only minor dialect variation among DGTU speaking communities. DGTU is not mutually intelligible with any other Philippine language. Thomas and Gieser (1973:65) grouped the ""Dingalan Bay Dumaget group: Umiray, Diteki, tagi Kabuluwen, Depoynga, Anglat"" with other Agta languages under ""Northern Negrito group and Luzon various."" On the basis of lexicostatistics, Walton (1979:81) subgrouped DGTU with Casiguran Dumagat (DGTC), the pair splitting off from Northern Cordilleran at 45% of shared cognates. This percentage of shared cognates is high, at least as far as DGTU is concerned, undoubtedly because of unexcluded borrowings; Headland and Headland (1974) calculate the percentage of cognates shared by DGTC and DGTU as 36 %, and this writer at 35%. McFarland (1980) also links DGTU with DGTC and the latter's close relatives East Cagayan Negrito, Paranan, and Kasiguranin. The latter are classified together as the Northern Dumagat languages, and DGTU is separated into a class by itself. ""Dumagat (Umirey) is very different from the other four, and may actually belong to a different subgroup (such as Northern Cordilleran) or constitute a subgroup by itself"" (66). He nevertheless states that the ""Dumagat languages are part of the Northern Philippine group, within which their closest relatives are probably the Northern Cordilleran languages"" (66). Reid, in contrast, holds that the closest relatives of DGTU are not to be found in the northern Philippines. Rather, ""a cursory inspection of sound changes and verb morphology suggests that it is probably a Central Philippine language, related fairly remotely to the Bikol languages"" (1994:41). 2. The Problem. In his 1994 article ""Possible non-Austronesian lexical elements in Philippine Negrito languages,"" Reid argues convincingly that languages spoken by modern Negrito populations are the descendants of creolized Austronesian speech acquired by the Negritos soon after coming into contact with the invading population. If these languages, indeed, developed from creoles, then they should not appear in a family tree of true Austronesian languages. Reid acknowledges this, writing (39): ""I shall continue, however, to refer to them as members of particular subfamilies of Philippine Austronesian languages...",1,0

"Abstract This paper presents an analysis of the patterns exhibited by Palenquero voiced stops, which reveals that there is a close connection between spirantization, prenasalization, flapping, and lateralization as they are articulatory maneuvers that a language may use to reduce the effort cost of implementing underlying voiced stops. Spirantization, prenasalization, and lateralization facilitate the production of voicing by allowing venting through one of the valves that separate the supraglottal cavity from the atmosphere. Flapping, on the other hand, yields this effect by reducing the temporal coordinates of the constriction target. The consequences that these articulatory adjustments have for the production of voicing are captured within the framework of Optimality Theory (Prince, Alan, Smolensky, Paul, 1993. Optimality Theory: Constraint Interaction in Generative Grammar. Ms., Technical Report No.2 of the Rutgers Center for Cognitive Science, Rutgers University) through a system of interacting constraints where L azy , a principle that embodies the tendency to reduce articulatory effort (Kirchner, Robert, 1995. Contrastiveness is an epiphenomenonas of constraint ranking. Rutgers Optimality Archive, 51-0295; Kirchner, Robert, 1998. An Effort-based Approach to Consonant Lenition. Doctoral dissertation, Rutgers Optimality Archive, 246-0898), rivals with I dent (Feature), the drive to preserve underlying feature specifications [University of Massachusetts Occasional Papers, 18 (1995) 249]. Central to this analysis is also the view that the sound component of a language may comprise several co-phonologies (Inkelas, Sharon, Orhan Orgun, C., Zoll, Cheryl, 1996. Exceptions and static prohonological patterns: cophonologies vs. prespecification. Rutgers Optimality Archive 124-0496; Inkelas, Sharon, Orhan Orgun, C., Zoll, Cheryl, 1997.

"Ā-dependencies occur when an argument appears clause-peripherally, dislocated from its canonical base position, as in relative clauses (1a). The displaced argument is a filler (italicized in (1) and throughout), and the base position is typically realized as a gap—that is, a syntactic category that is not pronounced (represented by an underscore throughout). A subset of languages that employ the filler-gap strategy, including Arabic (Aoun and Choueiri 1996), Irish (McCloskey 2006), Swedish (Engdahl 1986), and Vata (Koopman and Sportiche 1986), also use a second strategy to realize Ā-dependencies: resumption. Here, the base position is “filled” by an ordinary-looking resumptive pronoun (RP, boldfaced throughout).Bennett (2008) finds 66 instances of resumption in the Switchboard corpus (6,138 tagged five-minute telephone conversations), and Ferreira and Swets (2005) successfully elicited RPs in a production task by encouraging their participants to produce Ā-dependencies spanning a wh-island boundary. Their finding, that English speakers produce RPs in islands, converges with an intuition dating back to Ross 1967 that islands encourage resumption.Broadly speaking, the literature contains three approaches to explaining this distribution. One approach, amelioration, holds that RPs are used in precisely those environments where they would constitute an improvement with respect to gaps—either in acceptability (e.g., subjects inside strong islands; Keffala and Goodall 2011) or in comprehensibility (Hofmeister and Norcliffe 2013, Beltrama and Xiang 2016). The second approach, the last-resort strategy, holds that RPs circumvent constraints on movement, providing languages with a licit backup approach where gaps are prohibited (Kroch 1981, Shlonsky 1992). Finally, production approaches hold that RPs are an ungrammatical production phenomenon, the result of a production system that plans complex structures incrementally (Kroch 1981, Asudeh 2004, 2011a). According to Asudeh’s model, the system produces a series of locally well-formed structures that may not always result in global well-formedness (Kroch 1981, Asudeh 2004, 2011a; and see Tyler and Warren 1987 and Asudeh 2004 for an analogous idea in comprehension).Puzzlingly, recent experimental studies have demonstrated that English RPs are consistently rated as highly unacceptable, and nearly uniformly so across varying syntactic contexts (Dickey 1996, Alexopoulou and Keller 2007, Heestand, Xiang, and Polinsky 2011, Keffala and Goodall 2011, Clemens, Morgan, and Polinsky 2012, Han et al. 2012, Polinsky et al. 2013). On the most straightforward interpretation of unacceptability, this would imply that resumption is ungrammatical in English, even in domains where it is produced.Authors such as Alexopoulou and Keller (2007) and Polinsky et al. (2013) have claimed that these facts constitute a paradox: If resumption is ungrammatical, then what might explain its prevalence in production? Conversely, if the systematic production of RPs reflects grammatical knowledge, then what might account for its reported unacceptability? Or is RP production not systematic after all? One approach to resolving this apparent paradox posits two distinct grammars: one used in production, under which RPs are licit, and another used for acceptability judgment, under which RPs are illicit (Alexopoulou and Keller 2007, Polinsky et al. 2013).Part of the difficulty in reconciling comprehension and production data stems from the paucity of existing data: there are very few production studies, and they are limited in what syntactic structures are used (Zukowski and Larsen 2004, Ferreira and Swets 2005; cf. Chacón 2015). Therefore, the present study attempts to characterize the broad distribution of RPs in production in a controlled production task—the first attempt we are aware of to quantitatively characterize this distribution. The data reveal two patterns:We interpret these findings, along with acceptability data, as evidence that resumption is ungrammatical in English. We present an outline of a production model that is similar to Asudeh’s (2004, 2011a), but accounts for the distribution of RPs across syntactic contexts, along with several of the puzzling observations about English resumption.We asked 47 participants at the University of California, Santa Cruz, to complete a typed elicited-production task. Participants were presented with a “base” version (3a) of the target sentence, so called because all arguments appear in their base (unextracted) syntactic position. Participants were then presented with a prompt (3b), which included the beginning of a relative clause, whose head was one of the arguments from the base sentence. Participants were instructed to “rephrase the original sentence” by completing the prompt, trying “to convey all of the meaning from the old sentence in the new one.” The goal of this manipulation was to elicit continuations like (4a) and (4b).We created the materials in a 15-condition design. The first 12 conditions were organized by a 2 × 6 subdesign that crossed BASE POSITION with EMBEDDING DOMAIN. BASE POSITION refers to the syntactic position of the extraction site, and there were two levels: either Embedded Subject or Embedded Object. EMBEDDING DOMAIN refers to the container of the extraction site, and there were six levels: singly embedded nonislands (Emb 1), doubly embedded nonislands (Emb 2), wh-complements (Wh-),1 complex subject NPs (CNPC Subj), complex object NPs (CNPC Obj), and adjuncts. We added three baseline conditions by modifying the singly embedded nonisland, complex object NP, and adjunct conditions so that the target extraction site was the matrix subject. A total of 40 item sets were constructed; a sample set is given in table 1.Participant responses contained a range of structures, but 69% of them contained an extraction dependency with either a gap or an RP where the relative clause head appeared in the base sentence.2 Responses that did not conform to one of these two response types were not included in the analysis: 14% were ungrammatical (for reasons not related to resumption), 11% did not preserve the syntactic (8%) or thematic (3%) roles of the base, and 6% reformulated the base sentence in some other way (e.g., passivization). For full discussion of materials, procedures, coding, and so on, see Morgan 2013. A total of 1,155 responses from 42 participants were included in the analysis.Figure 1 plots the rate of RP production in each of the grammatical structures we tested. For matrix subject conditions (not plotted), only two RPs (&lt;1%) were observed (e.g., There’s a prince that he claims the ogre slayed the troll). Restricting our attention only to Embedded Subject and Embedded Object conditions, we first found that there was more resumption for embedded subjects than for embedded objects (overall, 55% vs. 41%, p &lt; .001). Resumption varied with embedding domain, with singly embedded nonislands giving rise to the least resumption (5%) and adjunct clauses giving rise to the most (92%). To characterize this relationship, we conducted a logistic regression. Our experimental conditions were coded as Helmert contrasts to reflect a series of nested binary comparisons following the rank order of bars in figure 1: first, between singly embedded nonislands and all other conditions; then, between doubly embedded nonislands and all islands; between complex object NPs and the remaining islands; between wh-complements and remaining islands; and finally between complex subject NPs and adjuncts. All these comparisons were significant at the α = 0.05 level, reflecting a steady increase in RP production across these nested comparisons. There were two interactions with base position for the first two comparisons, reflecting the fact that the subject vs. object difference was only present for island conditions. In sum, these results show (a) that production of resumptive pronouns is not categorical in any domain (i.e., there are no syntactic contexts that are produced exclusively with gaps or RPs, except perhaps matrix subject position), and (b) that the frequency with which RPs are produced depends on their syntactic context, ranging from 1% in high subject extractions to 98% in subject extractions from subject islands.On the hypothesis that the tendency to produce an RP in a given structure might depend on that structure’s acceptability, we asked 63 participants to judge the target sentences from Experiment 1 (see example (4) and online supplementary material at http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/suppl/10.1162/ling_a_00293. Sentences were created according to a fully crossed 3 (BASE POSITION: matrix subject, embedded subject, embedded object) × 6 (EMBEDDING DOMAIN: see production task) × 2 (STRATEGY: gap or RP) design, yielding 36 conditions. Thirty-six item sets were constructed from 36 items from the production study and were combined with 78 fillers designed to span the full range of acceptability. Judgments were made on 1-to-7 scale.The results, which are shown in figure 2, are generally consistent with those reported in previous experimental studies: sentences with gaps were rated highest for matrix (nonisland) argument extractions, and sentences with RPs displayed the characteristic uniform, low ratings across conditions. We did not replicate Keffala and Goodall’s (2011) and Han et al.’s (2012) finding that gaps are significantly less acceptable than RPs in subject extractions from strong islands: for example, there was no difference between object and subject extractions for adjunct conditions. It is possible that this reflects a floor effect stemming from our materials or scale.Because we observed that the rate of production of RPs increased as syntactic ill-formedness did, we tested the hypothesis that some measure of acceptability might predict RP production rate. Figure 3 plots the RP production rate against the gap acceptability rating. It shows a close, inverse relationship between the log-odds of producing an RP and how good the corresponding sentence with a gap is. It also suggests that RP rate is relatively inflated for dependencies that cross island boundaries (open symbols).To find the best description of this relationship, we constructed a series of linear regressions relating the production rate for a given construction (in logits) as a function of the mean z-scored acceptability of that construction with a gap in it (“gap acceptability”), the acceptability of that construction with an RP in it (“RP acceptability”), and the difference in acceptability between the RP and gap forms (“relative acceptability”). Because our observations come from two experiments with different samples of individuals, we used a bootstrap analysis to estimate the sampling distribution for our parameters. We created 10,000 resampled data sets for both the production and the comprehension experiments. In each instance, we sampled with replacement the items and participants to create a data set of the same size as the original (case resampling; Fox and Weisberg 2011). We recorded the coefficients for the regression models described in the text and their adjusted R2 value.Among the three models, gap acceptability was the best predictor (median R2adj: 0.70). This was a 16% improvement, on average, from relative acceptability (median R2adj: 0.61)—an advantage observed in 92% of our simulation runs. RP acceptability alone was never a good predictor (median R2adj: −0.03). We then considered whether incorporating islandhood as a categorical variable would lead to a better model. For both gap acceptability and relative acceptability, including islandhood as a fixed effect considerably improved the model (mean R2adj: 0.82 for gap acceptability and 0.83 for relative acceptability). Without considering islandhood, the RP rate of nonislands was always overestimated, and the RP rate of islands was always underestimated. Thus, it seems that crossing an island boundary boosts RP production above and beyond what is predicted on the basis of acceptability rating alone.3Figure 4 illustrates the four coefficients of the gap acceptability model, along with their sampling distributions.Two clear patterns emerge from our data: (a) as the acceptability of a given structure with a gap decreases, the frequency with which RPs are produced in that same structure increases; (b) extraction from an island domain further increases the tendency to use an RP, over and above the rate predicted by acceptability alone.Our first finding presents a strong challenge to the idea that there is an extreme asymmetry between comprehension and production such that resumption is under different constraints depending on the task—for example, if there were nonidentical grammars for production and comprehension (Alexopoulou and Keller 2007). A conservative interpretation would be that whatever factors join to determine the acceptability of a gap, those same factors also influence the likelihood of producing an RP. In a stronger interpretation, a speaker’s choice to abandon an Ā-dependency (i.e., produce an RP) would depend directly on gap acceptability.Notably, none of the existing accounts of English resumption fit straightforwardly with the joint pattern of acceptability and production we have observed. If RPs are a last-resort strategy (Kroch 1981, Shlonsky 1992), then their very low acceptability is at odds with the fact that they are grammatical (albeit a last resort; see Chomsky 1991). If they serve to ameliorate, then it should be the relative acceptability of gaps and RPs that predicts the RP distribution across clauses, not absolute gap acceptability. We agree with Asudeh (2004, 2011a) that RPs are likely epiphenomena of production processes, but our data reveal the need for a more specific hypothesis in order to predict the observed distribution and to explain the close relationship among production, acceptability, and grammaticality.We propose a mechanism that builds on two core components of production models: syntactic encoding and acceptability monitoring (Levelt 1989). According to this explanation, RPs are symptomatic of a breakdown in the production of a filler-gap dependency, and the likelihood of such a breakdown is increased by low gap acceptability and by islandhood. Specifically, at some point prior to the production of the gap, the speaker assesses the acceptability of the planned structure—consistent with Ferreira and Swets’s (2005) claim that production of these complex structures involves considerable advance planning.4 The probability that the system continues to form the filler-gap dependency is proportional to the gap structure’s degree of acceptability; that is, the higher the gap acceptability, the more likely the dependency is to be completed with a gap. In cases where the system does not continue the dependency, production nevertheless continues, but a gap is no longer licensed. The terminus of the abandoned filler-gap dependency is instead realized as a pronoun in order to satisfy local subcategorization constraints.On the surface, English RPs look like the outcome of a grammatical Ā-dependency strategy with RPs, as in Irish. Indeed, these utterances may be a precursor to grammaticized resumption (see Asudeh 2004, 2012). But at least in the current form of Standard American English, RPs appear to be epiphenomenal to the production system’s abandoning the production of an Ā-dependency. Consistent with many previous claims (Sells 1984, Prince 1990, Erteschik-Shir 1992, Asudeh 2004, 2011a,b, 2012, Polinsky et al. 2013, Chacón 2015), RPs function like ordinary pronouns from the perspective of the producer.5In our account, the production system’s asymmetric reliance on gap acceptability, but not RP acceptability, derives from the differential status of gaps and RPs in the grammar. In accordance with Levelt 1989, we assume that planning is mechanistically guided by grammatical knowledge. If, as we contend, RPs are ungrammatical, then the production system should be unable to plan—and consequently to monitor the acceptability of—a sentence with an RP. It follows that the probability of producing a RP cannot depend on the acceptability of that RP.This proposal also accounts for several other salient facts about resumption. The decision to continue gap production is inherently stochastic. Even in nonislands such as our singly embedded (Emb 1) condition, where gaps are highly acceptable, it is predicted that there would be a nonzero rate of resumption—which we found, albeit a very low rate indeed. When there was an additional level of embedding in nonislands (Emb 2), the rate of resumption increased. This is consistent with the prediction that the reduced acceptability associated with the extra level of embedding (see Dickey 1996) should encourage the filler-gap dependency to be abandoned more often. In islands, the fact that subject RPs are more common than object RPs may be similarly explained by virtue of the well-attested interaction between islandhood and syntactic position: within islands, subject gaps are less acceptable than object gaps (e.g., Kayne 1981, 1984, Keffala and Goodall 2011). Finally, the low, nearly uniform ratings of RPs are also predicted. From the perspective of the comprehender, resumptive constructions are the combination of two environments: a matrix clause that introduces a filler (There’s a prince), and an embedded clause that is licit within the embedded domain—that is, when shielded from the filler (that the ogre would jump for joy if he slayed the troll)—but is globally infelicitous because of the missing gap. Across various island and nonisland contexts, all resumptive constructions should incur one substantial cost to acceptability: that which stems from an incomplete filler-gap dependency.Our second finding—that islands boost rates of RP production above and beyond what would be expected just on the basis of their low gap acceptability—means that the noticeably increased tendency to use RPs in island contexts cannot be reducible to acceptability alone. Island-violating sentences would accurately be predicted to have a high baseline rate of resumption merely by virtue of their unacceptability. But islands also appear to encourage resumption in an island-particular way. The positive residuals for all island conditions in the acceptability-only model point to this conclusion, but we believe the most telling aspect of our data in this regard is the sensitivity of RP rates to whether or not the extraction is from subject or object position within the island domain. Embedded-subject extractions consistently lead to more resumptive pronouns than object extractions in each island condition. However, in nonisland conditions, there is no consistent relationship between extraction site and RP rate. For this reason, acceptability monitoring is not sufficient. We posit that an early problem during the grammatical encoding stage of production must also be able to trigger the severing of the filler-gap dependency. Because this mechanism is directly sensitive to grammaticality, the subject/object contrast in RP rates within islands may alternatively arise due to differences in grammaticality, narrowly construed (Kayne 1981, 1984).Our proposal agrees in many respects with Asudeh’s (2004, 2011a). Asudeh describes English RPs as the result of an incremental production system that occasionally opts for local over global well-formedness. He argues that in nonislands, the production system has a choice of how to realize the would-be gap position: either it can leave the position empty, to be linked with the filler, or it can insert a noun or pronoun into the position. In the latter case, the result is a clause that is locally well-formed, but a global structure that is ungrammatical because it contains a filler but no gap. In island domains, “the option of positing a gap . . . is not possible,” and as a result “the only way to construct a locally well-formed f-structure is to [insert] some lexical material”—for example, an RP (Asudeh 2011a:71).While our data generally support Asudeh’s proposal that RPs are part of productions that have become decoupled from global well-formedness, the fact that rates of RP production are very orderly indicates the need for a more specific linking hypothesis to account for when the production system shifts from global well-formedness to local well-formedness. Previous accounts generally predict a coarser, if not categorical distribution for RPs in production. According to amelioration hypotheses, RPs are licensed in just those domains where they represent an improvement relative to gaps. In relying on islandhood as a justification for resumption, last-resort accounts suggest that RPs should appear only in islands. Similarly, Asudeh’s (2004, 2011a) production model predicts that RPs should be categorically present in islands, and optional in nonislands. If, as we have argued, the process of forming filler-gap dependencies is probabilistically dependent not only on well-formedness but also on the (gradient) acceptability of the planned structure, then RPs should not be categorical in any domain. Instead, consistent with our production data, they should appear at low frequencies in nonislands and at much higher frequencies in islands. And, in both domains, the rate of resumption should be graded by the factors that control acceptability beyond grammaticality.A final benefit of production models like Asudeh’s (2004, 2011a) and our own is that the apparent paradox between judgment and production data is explained without having to adopt the position that there are distinct grammars for comprehension and production. The low acceptability of RPs reported here and elsewhere (e.g., Alexopoulou and Keller 2007, Keffala and Goodall 2011, Polinsky et al. 2013) would straightforwardly reflect their ungrammaticality. As we outline above, RPs’ prevalence in production, which at first glance might seem to implicate their grammaticality, can in fact be derived from knowledge of gaps in a production model that can abandon Ā-dependencies after they have been started.Ultimately, some larger questions still stand: If RPs are present in the input both to children learning Standard American English and to children learning Irish, why does only the latter group grammaticize them? Does the distribution or frequency of RPs provide children with a cue? Or does some property of English grammar preclude the grammaticization of RPs? The answers to these questions are not immediately apparent. We suspect that significant insights may be provided by experimental studies of production and comprehension in languages in which RPs are hypothesized to be grammatical.This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under grant DGE-1144086 (first author).",1,0

"Schools in the United States have historically conducted language policing in favor of standardized American English. The current study examines links between language policies in eight immigrant families in relation to educational language policies of two public elementary schools operating under an English-only policy in Massachusetts. The study places a focus on the agency of children and parents expressed through interviews, while paying attention to the institutional power of schooling. The participating families spoke Cape Verdean Creole, Mandarin, Portuguese, and Spanish as their heritage languages. Two theoretical frameworks informed our findings. Firstly, we use “family language policy” to define language decisions in families as a multifaceted construct. Secondly, we analyze family language beliefs and practices through a “language ideology” lens to unveil power structures influencing them. Our findings showed that the participants’ spoken beliefs positioned bilingualism and heritage language maintenance as valuable. However, family language decisions showed an increasing preference for English that inherently aligned with the English-only educational policies and practices and alienated heritage languages. Our study contributes to the existing body of literature on family language policy by adding more nuance to the contextual and fluid nature of language decisions in bilingual families.",1,0

"Glue Semantics (Glue) is a general framework for semantic composition and the syntax–semantics interface. The framework grew out of an interdisciplinary collaboration at the intersection of formal linguistics, formal logic, and computer science. Glue assumes a separate level of syntax; this can be any syntactic framework in which syntactic structures have heads. Glue uses a fragment of linear logic for semantic composition. General linear logic terms in Glue meaning constructors are instantiated relative to a syntactic parse. The separation of the logic of composition from structural syntax distinguishes Glue from other theories of semantic composition and the syntax–semantics interface. It allows Glue to capture semantic ambiguity, such as quantifier scope ambiguity, without necessarily positing an ambiguity in the syntactic structure. Glue is introduced here in relation to four of its key properties, which are used as organizing themes: resource-sensitive composition, flexible composition, autonomy of syntax, and syntax/semantics non-isomorphism. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Linguistics, Volume 8 is January 2022. Please see http://www.annualreviews.org/page/journal/pubdates for revised estimates.",1,0

"~RDPLAY AND PUNNING lie at the basis of a very large segment of American journalistic humor, particularly in the pioneer days before the Civil War. Hackneyed traces persist to our own times in the belabored efforts of professional gag-men, those feeders of jests to the frequently feeble purveyors of wit on radio and television programs. In sturdier. days, patterns of double meaning were numerous. Any word, phrase, regional allusion, or name might serve as a stimulation for the creation of a pun within a particular formula, such as the Wellerism, riddle, conundrum, proverb, epigram, definition, and the cliche.1 Rough and ready editorial comment likewise ventured to apply a double meaning to given names and to surnames, whenever the opportunity arose. The laws of libel have long since put an end to the invective-elements of such wordplay. In earlier times, the editor risked bodily harm frequently for the sake of a jibe which he could evolve from a name. Such allusions were dated commonly by political situations, as \vell as by contemporary manners and customs. However, such name-punning can claim no originality as a formula. Examples may be found in all European languages, as well as in antiquity. Only the variations of application suggest specialized American coloration. A convenient source for illustration of name-punning appears in a rare book, Prenticeana, or Wit and Humor in Paragraphs, Nev York, 1860. The author and conlpiler, G. D. Prentice, old-time newspaper man, noted the origin of his selections in his foreword: It (the book) is made up of a portion of the paragraphs that I have written for the Lo~~is(Jille Journal (I(entucky) during the last twenty-nine years, and a few of those written for the New York Ledger within the last t\VO years.

"ABSTRACT We developed the Hong Kong Specific Learning Difficulties Behavior Checklist for Junior Secondary School Students (BCL-JS) for teachers to rate the frequency of 52 reading-related behavioral characteristics of Chinese secondary school students. An item factor analysis based on ratings on 947 students yielded seven distinct dimensions. In a separate sample of 90 students, the seven constructs of the BCL-JS significantly correlated with students’ performances on most literacy and reading-related cognitive measures, and differentiated adolescents with or without dyslexia. Discriminant analysis showed that the BCL-JS had a high rate of correct classification (82.2%). These findings support that the BCL-JS is a reliable screening tool for Chinese junior secondary school students at risk for dyslexia.",1,0

"Abstract Metaphor is widely used in our daily lives to express strong emotions, comprehend abstract concepts and display aesthetic qualities. Women prefer metaphorical language when men pay them compliments in romantic situations; however, in this context, it remains unclear which factors are likely to contribute to the aesthetic attractiveness of metaphor. In the current study, 90 female undergraduates were recruited to rate 477 compliments in terms of language variables (i.e., appropriateness, figurativeness, familiarity, and imageability) and emotional perception (i.e., attractiveness, valence, romance, and arousal) on a 7-point Likert scale. The compliments were generated by 74 men who were required to use language to impress women in a previous independent experiment. A hierarchical regression model was built to explore the potential factors of the aesthetic attractiveness of metaphors. The results showed that a metaphor's attractiveness was positively correlated with figurativeness, imageability, romance and arousal but negatively associated with familiarity, which suggests that metaphors are more attractive when they incorporate high figurativeness, imageability, romance and arousal and low familiarity. Overall, this study indicates that a metaphor's aesthetic attractiveness may be determined by the social context, a communicator's motivation and specific linguistic aspects.",1,0

"Working with speakers of endangered languages often involves developing a rapport with the eldest members of a community and spending a great deal of time with them. These intense relationships present the outsider researcher with challenges unique to this type of work. The undertaking typically involves navigating great losses—not only of the language, but also the death of its speakers. The rationale for this talk resides in the recognition that grief and loss in language work bring with them a complex array of both personal and professional crises that require an open and cogent attempt to identify, explore, and deal with them. This talk draws on case study examples from the authors' own linguistic field research to examine the emotional component of language work through grief and loss. Reflexive consideration of a researcher's emotional state, and specifically grief, have been a part of the methodological fabric of field research in anthropology for decades (Rosaldo, 1993; Hedican, 2006; Throop, 2010; Henry, 2012). By contrast, linguists have only rarely delved into the stresses and emotional aspects of field research in print (Macaulay 2012 is a notable exception), and such receive a light touch in even the most comprehensive recent works (Chelliah & deReuse, 2011; Austin & Sallabank, 2015; Thieberger, 2012). Although it is often an unavoidable part of working with speakers of endangered languages, the subject of grief and loss is largely unexamined. With this talk, the authors hope to stimulate conversation about the emotional challenges that are unique to field research with endangered languages. This talk represents an attempt to problematize the experience of death in the field in two key ways. One is as a methodological issue that arises for those operating under collaborative models (Czaykowska-Higgins, 2009; Author, 2007; Leonard & Haynes, 2010) where investment by the community and participatory research by the fieldworker are the norm. Concerns include: the researcher's relationship to the circle of bereavement, questions raised regarding proper use of data and recordings, and how personal and professional aspects of loss are managed. The other is as a training issue involving responsibilities we bear to those we mentor in understanding the reality of close work with speakers, particularly of endangered languages. Concerns include: providing adequate preparation, managing responsibility--to the language, community, and profession--in a way that can be borne through loss, and expectations held by the community with regard to participation in death traditions.

"The use of magic and religion in healing practices in Vietnam is relatively popular. In the folklore and folk religion of Vietnam, it is often said that “In case of sickness, follow any feasible cures [co benh thi vai tu phuong]” in the sense that all means, including using religious beliefs and rituals, will be used to get healing for oneself or one’s relatives. When people or their relatives get sick, besides going to medical facilities, they will look for a shaman, necromancer, monks, even priests, bishops, and pastors to cure the illness they or their relatives are suffering from. Based on Mircea Eliade’s theory published in The Sacred and the Profane (Eliade, 2016), the article has the ambition to offer a different perspective on the use of magic (sometimes considered as a religious ritual by the subject) to cure disease. We employ both the comparative and analytical methods of study as we explore concrete cases of treatment of patients with different religious beliefs (Ms. T’s case of treatment, following Buddhist practices in comparison with the healing cases of the Mother Goddess Worship and the Catholic Church). The authors propose that a uniquely Vietnamese philosophy of life (Life-philosophy) serves as a constitutive basis for the adaptation of magic in healing practices, being itself formed and influenced by these practices.",1,0
"Nonlinear methods of fractal analysis and recurrence quantification analysis are becoming more commonplace in the cognitive and behavioral sciences. These methods are illustrated here in a tutorial style using self-paced reading data. Self-paced reading was performed in which each spacebar press revealed a story word-by-word or else sentence-by-sentence. Participant readers were either Ph.D. candidates in English literature or undergraduates from an introductory psychology course and the same story was read by all, either one time only or reread another time on another occasion. The nonlinear analyses revealed crucial differences between the word unit and sentence unit conditions. Performance in the word unit condition was dominated by a task specific strategy, yielding data patterns more like those observed in tapping tasks. Nonlinear analyses of the sentence unit condition, however, discriminated between graduate and undergraduate readers, and first readings of the story from re-reading. From these analyses, the repeated reading of the same story reveals a kind of über-fluency, in a manner of speaking, of the Ph.D. candidates in English literature, whose performance stayed at or closer to a performance ceiling in both readings.",1,0

"Abstract A typical trait of the modern Tibetic languages is that speakers obligatorily encode the knowledge base for their statements: whether they have intimate and/or authoritative knowledge of a situation, whether they have merely perceived a situation, whether they have merely inferred (or presumed etc.) a situation, whether they have second-hand knowledge, or even whether their knowledge is shared with the addressee or the larger community. In most of the Tibetic languages, speakers do not differentiate between different perceptual channels. By contrast, in most of the Ladakhi dialects, speakers appear to differentiate between visual perception, using the auxiliary ḥdug (or snaṅ ), and sense perception through other channels, using the auxiliary rag . This opposition needs to be reanalysed based on the observation of how a congenitally blind speaker deals with these two options and upon certain unexpected choices made by non-handicapped speakers.",1,0

This article presents new evidence from Kirundi (Bantu) that supports (a) but defies (b), a paradox that is only apparent. Four sets of facts are discussed: antilocality in promise-constructions, control obviation in inverse OC constructions, passivization in transitive expletive OC constructions, and OC in long-distance inversion constructions.

"Der jahrhundertelange Kontakt zwischen der slowenischen und deutschen Sprache und Kultur hat die Stadt Maribor bedeutsam geprägt. Seit den Anfängen der Stadtentwicklung im 12. Jh., vor allem aber seit dem 13. Jh., als die Stadt unter die Herrschaft der Habsburger kam, nahm die Zuwanderung aus den deutschsprachigen Ländern stark zu, vorrangig aus dem heutigen österreichischen Kärnten und der österreichischen Steiermark, jedoch auch aus Bayern und vielen deutschen mittelalterlichen Städten, was zu einem stark ausgeprägten deutschen Stadtcharakter führte. Die deutschsprachigen Zuwanderer waren in der Regel hochqualifiziert und gebildet; sehr schnell übernahmen sie führende Positionen in der Wirtschaft und im öffentlichen Leben.

"In many acoustic conditions, a single-channel recorded speech signal may be severely affected by reverberation and noise, leading to a reduced speech quality and intelligibility. This paper focuses on proposing a novel two-stage model scheme by decomposing room impulse responses (RIRs) into two convolution parts for single-channel speech dereverberation and denoising. Similar as previous methods, the proposed two-stage model uses non-negative approximations of the convolutive transfer function (N CTF) to simultaneously estimate the magnitude spectrograms of the speech and the RIR. It focuses on iteratively updating model parameters to estimate a less reverberant speech signal and a short RIR at first stage, then the clean speech signal and the other short RIR are estimated by iteratively renewing at the second stage. There are always denosing processing steps existing in both stages to denoise more thoroughly. A straightforward method based on the scheme is built to enhance the speech from the noisy reverberant signal, then two fusion methods inspired by ensemble learning are proposed for speech enhancement. The advantages of our proposed methods are more capable to enhance the speech and more time-saving through decomposing the long RIRs into two shorter ones. Additionally, the optimal estimator is derived based on temporal stacking to utilize speech temporal dynamics. Experiments are performed on two simulated RIRs and a real RIR to compare the performances of the proposed methods with a state-of-the-art method and the results show that the proposed methods have achieved either better or comparable performances in most measures but phone error rate.",1,0

"Abstract Two experiments investigated how people perceived and remembered fragments of spoken words that either corresponded to correct lexical entries (as in the complex word drink-er ) or did not (as in the simple word glitt-er ). Experiment 1 was a noise-rating task that probed perception. Participants heard stimuli such drink er , where strikethrough indicates noise overlaid at a controlled signal-to-noise ratio, and rated the loudness of the noise. Results showed that participants rated noise on certain pseudo-roots (e.g., glitt er ) as louder than noise on true roots ( drink er ), indicating that they perceived them with less clarity. Experiment 2 was an eye-fixation task that probed memory. Participants heard a word such as drink-er while associating each fragment with a visual shape. At test, they saw the shapes again, and were asked to look at the shape associated with a particular fragment, such as drink . Results showed that fixations to shapes associated with pseudo-affixes ( -er in glitter ) were less accurate than fixations to shapes associated with true affixes ( -er in drinker ), which suggests that they remembered the pseudo-affixes more poorly. These findings provide evidence that the presence of correct lexical entries for roots and affixes modulates people’s judgments about the speech that they hear.",1,0

"The general opinion of classical philologians is well reflected by Oldfather when he speaks' of 'Zenodotus and Aristophanes, who, as is well known, held a somewhat heterodox view about the equivalence of the dual and the plural in Homer'. This belief needs, in my opinion, correction. Linguists have worked to a clear understanding in general of the forces that produced the welter of dual and plural forms found in the text of Homer. In the epic dialect the dual is an inheritance from Aeolic, but its use is being continued and imitated by Ionic-speaking poets, who have no dual in their daily dialect, and the result is naturally deviation from the earlier usage.2 Just how far this deviation extended during the composition of the Iliad and the Odyssey is a question about which, in my opinion, the linguists have been led astray by a misunderstanding of the philological evidence. There is a secondary increase of the confusion due to interpolation which must be sorted out, and also a tertiary increase of two sorts. First, we have linguistic evidence,3 most strongly marked in Zenodotus, for Ionic influence upon the text in post-Pisistratean times. To this I should ascribe the substitution of",1,0

"In recent years forensic phoneticians, in consultation with psychologists and law enforcement officers, have put considerable effort into devising and refining procedures for preparing and conducting fair voice parades. In England and Wales, a procedure for conducting a voice parade is outlined in a 2003 Home Office circular; this has been successfully implemented in a number of cases. These guidelines explain that a phonetician should examine the foil voice samples to ensure that the voices provide a fair comparison against the suspect, however, a formalised method for making this comparison is not offered.

Relevant language learner strategy literature and speech act literature are reviewed. After defining language learning and use strategies, the article makes the case for enhancing learner strategies in developing speech act ability. Next, as a lead up to the presentation of the taxonomy of strategies, the issue of where learners are to find empirical sources for speech act material is addressed, with attention given to the current concerns for naturally-occurring data. This is followed by a review of literature on efforts to teach pragmatics. The article concludes with a discussion of suggested avenues for validating the strategy taxonomy.",1,0

"Abstract The study of multimodality in discourse reveals the way writers articulate their intended meanings and intentions. Systemic functional analyses of oral biology discourse have been limited to few studies; yet, no published study has investigated multimodal textual features. This qualitative study explored and analyzed the multimodal textual features in undergraduate dentistry texts. The systemic functional multimodal discourse analysis (SF-MDA) is framed by Halliday’s (Halliday, M. A. K. 2014. Introduction to Functional Grammar. Revised by Christian M. I. M. Matthiessen . 4th ed. London/New York: Taylor and Francis) linguistic tools for the analysis of Theme and Kress and van Leeuwen’s (Kress, Gunther, and Theo van Leeuwen. 2006. Reading Images: The Grammar of Visual Design . London: Routledge) framework for the analysis of visual designs. Oral biology discourse intertwines two thematic progression patterns: constant and linear. Although a split-rheme pattern was minimally employed, disciplinary-specific functions of this pattern emerged. The SF-MDA of the composition of information in oral biology pictures extends Kress and van Leeuwen’s functional interpretations of the meaning-making resources of visual artifacts. Finally, the pedagogical implications for science tutors and for undergraduate nonnative science students are presented.",1,0

"A method is presented for deciding whether correct predictions about other people are based on simulation or theory use. The differentiating power of this method was assessed with cognitive estimation biases (e.g. estimating the area of Brazil) in two variations. Experiments 1 and 2 operated with the influence of response scales of different length. Experiment 3 used the difference between free estimates that tended to be far off the true value and estimates constrained by an appropriate response scale, where estimates became greatly more realistic. The critical question is how well observer subjects can predict these target biases under two different presentation conditions. Response scale biases (Experiments 1 and 2) were more strongly predicted when observer subjects were presented with the two scales juxtaposed, than when responses for each scale were given independently. This speaks for the use of a theory, since simulation should, if there is any difference at all, be made more difficult by the juxtaposition of conditions. The difference between free and constrained estimations (Experiment 3) was more strongly predicted under independent than under juxtaposed presentation. This speaks for the use of simulation since use of a theory should, if anything, be helped by juxtaposition of problems since it helps highlight the theoretically relevant factor. Results are discussed in view of recent proposals about when simulation is likely to be used, i.e. for belief fixation but not action prediction (Stich and Nichols, 1995b), for content fixation (Heal, 1996a), and for rational effects only (Heal, 1996b).",1,0

"Recent editions of Shakespeare's plays are content to remark that the Goodwins is a dangerous shoal off the coast of Kent. Just why Shakespeare chose to re~er to these sands has, however, been discussed by several who come to the general conclusion that the above passage is used for local color,  ... to make us believe that we are in Venice, where Venetians, and not Englishmen, are speaking.' '2 While this conj ecture may be true, it is possible that the choice of the particular shoals involved much more than local color. The Merchant of Venice is a play of friendship. The situation, by the beginning of Act III, is that Antonio, who has pawned his life as security for his friend Bassanio, is in danger of forfeiting his life because he is unable to repay the loan. Antonio is a merchant. His business depends upon the success of his ships at sea. If these ships were to be wrecked, what means of destruction would further the plot and at the same time be most dramatically appropriate for Antonio's situation? In the opinion of this writer, it would be difficult to choose a more dramatically appropriate cause of destruction than the Goodwins,3 for the name",1,0

"When we think of the ways we use language, we think of face-to-face conversations, telephone conversations, reading and writing, and even talking to oneself. These arenas of language use--theaters of action in which people do things with language. But what exactly are they doing with language? What their goals and intentions? By what processes do they achieve these goals? In these twelve essays, Herbert H. Clark and his colleagues discuss the collective nature of language--the ways in which people coordinate with each other to determine the meaning of what they say. According to Clark, in order for one person to understand another, there must be a common ground of knowledge between them. He shows how people infer this common ground from their past conversations, their immediate surroundings, and their shared cultural background. Clark also discusses the means by which speakers design their utterances for particular audiences and coordinate their use of language with other participants in a language arena. He argues that language use in conversation is a collaborative process, where speaker and listener work together to establish that the listener understands the speaker's meaning. Since people often use words to mean something quite different from the dictionary definitions of those word, Clark offers a realistic perspective on how speakers and listeners coordinate on the meanings of words. This collection presents outstanding examples of Clark's pioneering work on the pragmatics of language use and it will interest psychologists, linguists, computer scientists, and philosophers. Herbert H. Clark is professor in the Department of at Stanford University andcoauthor, with E. V. Clark, of Psychology of Language: An Introduction to Psycholinguistics.",1,0

"The paper describes and compares two abortive projects for Latin dictionaries in Victorian Britain: the projected collaborative volume by Henry Nettleship of Oxford and John Mayor of Cambridge, and the dictionary by Thomas Key of London, left unfinished on his death and later published as a fragment. Both projects involved failed attempts at collaboration; both represented attempts to break away from the tradition of making dictionaries by revising previous works; and in both cases, the publication of rival works undermined these slow-moving projects. The paper discusses all these factors, and emphasises the significance of the history of failed dictionaries for the history of lexicography in general.",1,0

Although each function serves a different purpose, they are intimately related by virtue of their sharing the same anatomic conduit for air and food. Thus, problems associated with swallowing and feeding can present with airway symptoms, and conversely, an airway problem may be made worse by feeding.

In this article, we demonstrate how many of the assumptions that underlie this growing field of research and the way that heritage speakers are positioned as research subjects reveal ideologies that center and value monolingualism and whiteness. We problematize a number of ways in which these ideologies commonly show up in the frameworks and methodologies used in psycholinguistics to study this population. We advocate for frameworks such as usage-based linguistics and multicompetence that center the multidimensional experiences of bilinguals and embrace nuance and complexity. We call on the research community to examine their research designs and theories to dismantle the systems that maintain heritage bilingualism at the margins of bilingualism research.",1,0

A partir de este estado de la cuestión se propone un modelo específicamente lingüístico / discursivo de la comunicación de riesgo, susceptible de ser considerado como un área definida de la pragmática aplicada. Tal modelo se despliega en dos niveles: el que tiene en cuenta las estrategias discursivas encargadas del encuadre textual (léxico, sintaxis, ilocutividad, informatividad y dialogismo) y el que define la posición enunciativa desde la que se construye el mensaje (transparencia, planificación, disposición ante los receptores). Las categorías y funciones de los dos niveles se presentan mediante ejemplos concretos referidos a la gestión de la pandemia del SARS-CoV-2, cuya revisión ordenada permite identificar en cada caso algunos errores y opciones desafortunadas que constituyen verdaderos «riesgos de la comunicación de riesgo».",1,0

研究古韵分部大都根据古人诗歌押韵用字，归纳类推而得。材料中用韵分合有异，往往会视作音韵变化的痕迹。然而古人用韵是否一定从严？两字相押，是否一定韵母相同？本文试就香港粤语歌曲中的押韵情形，对这问题作一探讨。研究材料包括四百多首流行歌曲，押韵的字数以千计。韵脚可以利用系联的原则归纳成二十四韵部，而现代粤语共有五十三个韵母，两者之间相距甚大。细究其因，粤语歌曲除韵母相同的字可以互相押韵以外，更有两种通押的现象。一种是凡元音相同的字皆可互押，所以阳声韵本-m，-n，-ng三分，诗歌中可以通叶，而且阴阳入通押的例子也比比皆是。另一种情形是历史遗留下来的押韵成规。江阳不分，支微通叶，这是从词曲以来已有的现象，今人填词，虽是发音不同，但仍照叶无碍。据此而言，诗歌用韵和实际语言并不完全符合。研究古音，对于材料运用，不得不严加谨慎。香港粤语歌曲中又有中西语言互相押韵的现象，文中也一并陈述。,1,0

"This article analyzes Old English vocabulary of time to shed light on the historical, sociocultural dimensions of space–time metaphorical mappings in English. First, we offer an overview of the most significant theoretical and experimental findings on the metaphorical conceptualization of time in Modern English. Then we analyze the sense of time in Old English and describe how native cultural conventions and cross-cultural contact might have contributed to shaping the perception of time in the Old English period. Finally, through corpus and dictionary searches, we explore how space and time were intertwined to convey time notions in the earliest attestations of English. Results show a persistent metaphorical link between space and time in Old English vocabulary and provide evidence for a circular and linear conceptualization of time that flexibly recruited the vertical and sagittal (front–back) axes, and that allowed for time-based and ego-based metaphorical construals, including the time-moving and ego-moving subcases. These data suggest that a baseline conceptualization of time grounded in spatial relations and sensitive to sociocultural factors has existed through time surviving to the present day.",1,0
"El presente artículo utiliza datos provenientes de conversaciones cotidianas y aplica el método del análisis conversacional para reportar algunas características interaccionales de seis partículas lingüísticas (no, pues, oye, o sea, ah y ay) o marcadores secuenciales, como se les define aquí. Los marcadores secuenciales tienen una función deíctica y de inicio, i.e., hacen referencia al habla anterior o bien inician una nueva actividad interaccional. Por sí mismos, los marcadores constituyen unidades de construcción de turno ya que proyectan momentos pertinentes para la transición del turno. Los marcadores realizan y constituyen acciones sociales interaccionales. El estudio conversacional de estos elementos lingüísticos muestra aspectos lingüístico-culturales de los hablantes. Se sugiere que este tipo de partículas lingüísticas puede ser parte de la “mecánica” universal de la interaccional humana.",1,0

"I am deeply grateful for the honor of this award, all the more so for its being completely unexpected. I am especially pleased by the recognition this award gives to our early attempts to build computational models of dialogue and to develop algorithms that would enable computer systems to converse sensibly with people. ACL was my first academic home. I presented my first paper, the paper that laid out the basics of a computational model of discourse structure, at the 1975 ACL meeting. Then, after several decades of research centered on dialogue systems, my research focus shifted to modeling collaboration. This shift was driven in part by the need for computational models of collaborative activities to support dialogue processing, a topic which I explore briefly below, and in part by limitations in speech processing and semantics capabilities. Research in these areas has advanced significantly in the last decade, enabling advances in dialogue as well, and I have recently returned to investigating computer system dialogue capabilities and challenges. I am glad to be back in my intellectual home.The use of language has been considered an essential aspect of human intelligence for centuries, and the ability for a computer system to carry on a dialogue with a person has been a compelling goal of artificial intelligence (AI) research from its inception. Turing set conversational abilities as the hallmark of a thinking machine in defining his “imitation game,” more commonly referred to as “The Turing Test.” In the 1950 Mind paper in which he defines this game, Turing conjectures thus, “I believe that at the end of the century the use of words and general educated opinion will have altered so much that one will be able to speak of machines thinking without expecting to be contradicted.” (Turing 1950, p. 442). Though the Turing Test remains an elusive (and now debatable) goal, this conjecture has proved true. Natural language processing research has made great progress in the last decades, with personal assistant systems and chatbots becoming pervasive, joining search and machine translation systems in common use by people around the world. Although it is commonplace to hear people talk about these systems in anthropomorphic terms — using “she” more frequently than “it” in referring to them — the limitations of these systems’ conversational abilities frequently leads people to wonder what they were thinking or if they even were thinking. As the dialogue in Figure 1 illustrates, at root these systems lack fundamental dialogue capabilities. The first assignment in a course I have been teaching, “Intelligent Systems: Design and Ethical Challenges,” is to test phone-based personal assistants. Although some systems might handle this particular example, they all fail similarly, and the range of dialogue incapabilities students have uncovered is stunning. As I have argued elsewhere, the errors that systems make reveal how far we still have to go to clear Turing’s hurdle or to have systems smart enough to (really) talk with us (Grosz, 2012).The first generation of speech systems, which were developed in the 1970s, divided system components by linguistic category (e.g., acoustic-phonetics, syntax, lexical and compositional semantics), and dialogue challenges of that era included identifying ways to handle prosody and referring expressions, along with nascent efforts to treat computationally language as action. In contrast, current spoken language research takes a more functional perspective, considering such issues as sentiment analysis, entrainment, and deception detection. Typical current dialogue challenges include such functions as turn-taking, clarification questions, and negotiation. The database query applications of earlier decades, which lacked grounding in dialogue purpose, have been replaced by template filling and chat-oriented applications that are designed for relatively narrowly defined tasks.Various findings and lessons learned in early attempts to build dialogue systems have potential to inform and significantly improve the capabilities of systems that currently aim to converse with people. Although the computational linguistic methods that have recently enabled great progress in many areas of speech and natural-language processing differ significantly from those used even a short while ago, the dialogue principles uncovered in earlier research remain relevant. The next two sections of this paper give brief summaries of the principal findings and foundations in models of dialogue and collaboration established in the 1970s through the 1990s. The following section examines principles for dialogue systems derived from these models that could be used with current speech and language processing methods to improve the conversational abilities of personal assistants, customer service chatbots, and other dialogue systems. The paper concludes with scientific and ethical challenges raised by the development and deployment of dialogue-capable computer systems.My first papers on dialogue structure (Grosz [Deutsch], 1974, 1975; Grosz, 1977) were based on studies of task-oriented dialogues I collected to inform the design of the discourse component of a speech understanding system. In these dialogues, an expert (who was eventually to be replaced by the system) instructed an apprentice in equipment assembly. The expert and apprentice were in separate rooms, they communicated through a teletype interface (with a camera available for still shots on demand), and the apprentice was led to believe the expert was a computer system. These dialogues were collected as part of what were, to my knowledge, the first “Wizard of Oz” experiments.1Figure 2 is one example from this collection. It illustrates the influence of dialogue structure on definite noun phrase interpretation. In Utterance (3), the expert (E) directs the apprentice (A) to loosen two setscrews. In Utterance (8), the expert instructs the apprentice to loosen “the screw in the center”. The only intermediate explicit mention of screw-like objects are subsequent references to the setscrews in Utterance (5) and the elided subdialogue about them between Utterances (3) and (5). With only two objects, one cannot be in the center. Indeed, the screw to which the expert refers in Utterance (8) is in the center of the wheelpuller. This dialogue fragment has a structure that parallels the task of removing the flywheel. When the first step of that task (loosening the setscrews) is completed, as indicated by the apprentice in Utterance (5), the focus of attention of expert and apprentice move to the step of pulling off the wheel with the wheelpuller. At the point of mention of “the screw in the center”, the setscrews are no longer relevant or in context; the wheelpuller is.A more striking example is provided by the dialogue sample in Figure 3. Each of the successful assemblies of the air compressor ended in one of the ways shown in this figure. Despite admonitions of grammar teachers and editors that pronouns be used to refer to the last object mentioned that matches in number and gender, actual use of pronouns can vary markedly. In this case, the pronoun “it” is used to refer to the air compressor after half an hour of dialogue in which there was no explicit mention of it.Again, context and the focus of attention has shifted over the course of the assembly and the expert-apprentice dialogue related to it. At the point at which the last utterance occurs, the air compressor is assembled and is the focus of attention. Not only did the participants in these dialogues have no trouble understanding what was to be plugged in or turned on (even though they were in a room full of equipment that might have provided other options), but also readers of the transcripts of these dialogues are not confused.The narrative fragment in Figure 4, which is from the work of Polanyi and Scha (1983), shows that this kind of discourse structure influence on referring expressions is not restricted to task dialogues. The linearly nearest referent for the pronoun “them” in the last utterance is the children mentioned in the previous utterance. It is the groceries that were put away though, not the children. This example also illustrates the role of prosody in signaling discourse structure. Intonation is crucial to getting the interpretation of this story right. The second utterance is said as an aside, with strong intonational markers of this separation. Prosody, then, is integral to dialogue processing, and spoken dialogue cannot be handled as a pipeline from speech recognition to pragmatic plan recognition.These fragments illustrate a primary finding of my early dialogue research: dialogues are not linear sequences of utterances nor simply question–answer pairs. This work established that task-oriented dialogues are structured, with multiple utterances grouping into a dialogue segment, and their structure mirrors the structure of the task. Subsequently, Candy Sidner and I generalized from task dialogues to discourse more generally, defining a computational model of discourse structure (Grosz and Sidner, 1986). This model defines discourse structure in terms of three components as shown in the schematic in Figure 5. The linguistic structure comprises the utterances themselves, including their various linguistic features, which cluster into dialogue segments. Just as written language is broken into paragraphs, the utterances of spoken language naturally form groups. The attentional state tracks the changes in focus of attention of the dialogue participants as their conversation evolves. The intentional structure comprises the purposes underlying each dialogue segment and their relationships to one another. Relationships between dialogue segment purposes (DSPs) determine embedding relationships between the corresponding discourse segments (DS), and thus they are foundational to determining changes in attentional state. These three components of discourse structure are interdependent. The form of an utterance and its constituent phrases are affected by attentional state and intentional structure, and they in turn may engender changes in these components of discourse structure.Sidner and I examined two levels of attentional state. The global level, which is portrayed in Figure 5, is modeled by a focus space stack. Focus spaces contain representations of the objects, properties, and relations salient within a discourse segment as well as the discourse segment purpose. When a new dialogue segment is started, a space is pushed onto the stack, and when the segment completes, the corresponding focus space is popped from the stack. This level of attentional state influences definite noun phrase interpretation and generation and intention recognition processes. Access to objects, properties, and relations at lower levels of the stack may not be available at higher levels. The local level of attentional state, which Sidner and I referred to as “immediate focus” (“local focus” being a tongue twister), models smaller shifts of attention within a discourse segment. Sidner (1979, 1981, 1983a) deployed immediate focusing as a means of controlling the inferences required for interpreting anaphoric expressions like pronouns and demonstratives by limiting the number of entities considered as possible referents. Webber’s contemporaneous work on the range of anaphors a single seemingly simple definite noun phrase could yield made clear the importance of being able to limit candidates (Webber, 1979, 1986). It is important to note that “focus” has been used for various other ideas in linguistics. For instance, the Prague School of computational linguistics uses topic/focus information structures to relate sentences to discourse coherence (Hajicova, 2006), and “topic” is used to refer to speech signal properties in the prosody literature and to syntactic properties in some grammatical theories.A short while later, Joshi and Weinstein investigated ways to control a system’s overall reasoning by using information about which entity was central in an utterance. They defined a concept of “centers of a sentence in a discourse,” which bore strong similarity to immediate focus. They used this concept to derive initial results on how differences in centers changed the complexity of inferences required to integrate a representation of the meaning of an individual utterance into a representation of the meaning of the discourse of which it was a part (Joshi and Weinstein, 1981). A year after their paper appeared, I was fortunate to be invited by Joshi to be a visiting faculty member at the University of Pennsylvania. During that visit Joshi, Weinstein, and I merged their centering ideas with Sidner’s discourse ideas into what became known as “centering theory,” which highlighted the process of “centering of attention” and considered constraints on generation as well as interpretation (Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein, 1983; Grosz, Weinstein, and Joshi, 1995). We adopted centering terminology because of the already widely varying uses of “focus.” A vast literature on centering has followed, including cross-linguistic empirical and psycholinguistic investigations of centering predictions in English, German, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Turkish, and many other languages; variations in ways centers are realized in language; and development of a range of centering algorithms. Recently, Kehler and Rohde have developed a probabilistic model that combines centering with coherence-relation driven theories (Kehler and Rohde, 2013).Investigations of linguistic markers of discourse boundaries soon followed. Hirschberg and Pierrehumbert launched research in this area with their influential work on the intonational structuring of discourse. They showed that pitch range, amplitude, and timing correlated with global and local structures defined in the tripartite model Sidner and I had developed (Hirschberg and Pierrehumbert, 1986; Pierrehumbert and Hirschberg, 1990). Hirschberg and Litman (1987, 1993) showed that pitch accent and prosodic phrasing distinguish between discourse and sentential usage of such cue phrases as “now.” Their example from a radio talk show, “So in other words I will have to pay the full amount of the uh of the tax now what about Pennsylvania state tax?” illustrates the importance of determining which use a speaker intended. Later Hirschberg and I investigated empirically ways in which speakers use intonation to mark discourse structure boundaries (Grosz and Hirschberg, 1992). For her Ph.D. research, Nakatani worked with us on determining ways in which accent placement varied with grammatical function, form of referring expression, and attentional status (Hirschberg, Nakatani, and Grosz, 1995; Hirschberg and Nakatani, 1996).One challenge for these investigations of intonational markers of discourse structures was to obtain examples from multiple people of spontaneous speech with essentially the same content. In one of the earlier attempts to develop a corpus of spontaneous, naturally occurring dialogue, we designed a set of tasks which led multiple speakers to give similar directions around the Cambridge/Boston area. To connect intonation with discourse structure, the resulting Boston Directions Corpus was annotated by multiple trained annotators for prosodic events using the ToBI labeling conventions (Hirschberg and Beckman ; Beckman, Hirschberg, and Shattuck-Hufnagel 2004) as well as for discourse structure using a guide based on the tripartite model of discourse structure. The design of materials that can evoke spontaneous speech of a near identical nature from multiple speaker remains a challenge, one that urgently needs to be addressed for the improvement of capabilities of personal assistant and chatbot systems.The third component of discourse structure, the intentional structure, has roots in work on language as action in philosophy (Austin, 1962; Grice, 1969; Searle, 1969) and subsequent work on language as planned behavior in artificial intelligence (Bruce, 1975; Cohen and Perrault, 1979; Allen and Perrault, 1980; Sidner, 1983b). The example in Figure 6, adapted from Bruce (1975), provides an example of the need to infer the intentions behind an utterance to respond appropriately. In this dialogue fragment, C is attempting to get B to get rid of the bugs on the rhubarb plant, not completely successfully. I have used this example because it is less task-oriented than others and so illustrates the general need for this capability. This research on language as planned behavior yielded several algorithms for recognizing speakers’ intentions and generating utterances that communicated them. This work, though, was largely focused on individual utterances or pairs of utterances, and the planning methods it used were based on AI research on single agent planning.Sidner and I attempted to generalize these methods to the dialogue setting, but eventually determined that intentional structure could not be represented by any sum of single agent plans. This realization led us to formulate a computational formalization of collaborative two-agent plans, which we called SharedPlans (Grosz and Sidner, 1990). Kraus and I subsequently generalized this initial model to one able to handle an arbitrary number of agents and more complex recipes for actions (Grosz and Kraus, 1996, 1999). Hunsberger in his Ph.D. dissertation subsequently modified the initial formalizations to enable proving properties of SharedPlans (Hunsberger, 1998) and to formally integrate decision making (Grosz and Hunsberger, 2006). Lochbaum’s dissertation research showed how SharedPlans could be used as the basis of the intentional structure of dialogue (Lochbaum, 1998). In recent years, supporting evidence for the importance of collaboration to language processing has come from research in brain sciences and developmental psychology that has established the importance of social interaction to brain development and language learning.Figure 7 provides English glosses of the major elements of the SharedPlans specification of collaboration. The term “recipe” in (2) refers to (knowing) a way to do an action. In the formal SharedPlans specification, each of the requirements for commitment is represented in terms of intentions and those for consensus in terms of mutual belief. There can be no intention without ability: Philosophical and logical theories of intention require that an agent be able to do any action it forms an intention to do. As a result, the commitments stipulated in various parts of the specification implicitly carry such a requirement. The literature on teamwork demonstrates that each element is required for teamwork to succeed by showing ways in which teamwork could fail if the requirements on agent beliefs or intentions that it specifies are not met. For instance, if some team members do not commit as in (1), those team members could walk away from the activity without meeting their obligations or neglect to inform other team members if they were unable to meet their obligations; if they do not commit to each other’s success as in (5), they could fail to provide help to each other. In such cases, the teamwork could fail. The interactions among the intentions and (mutual) beliefs in this specification are an embodiment of the need for the capabilities for collaboration to be designed into systems from the start (Grosz, 1996). Alternative computational theories of teamwork (Cohen and Levesque, 1991; Sonenberg et al., 1992, inter alia) differ in the particulars, but have similar types of principles, which if not adhered to cause the teamwork to fail.Each of the requirements or constraints in the SharedPlan specifications might engender extended dialogue related to satisfying it. The dialogue in Figure 2 can be used to sketch the way Lochbaum (1998) used SharedPlans to model intentional structure and to illustrate the kind of reasoning about intentions that is needed to recognize dialogue structure and understand utterances in a dialogue. In essence, the intentional structure is a collection of SharedPlans (some partial, some completed) and relationships between these plans (e.g., that one is needed as part of another) determine relationships between the DSPs constituting the structure. As the schematic in Figure 8 shows, the expert and apprentice have a (partial) SharedPlan (PSP) to remove the pump, which includes as a substep removing the flywheel (i.e., doing so is part of the recipe). Clause [2ai] in the figure is part of the logical specification for element (4) in the SharedPlan specification in Figure 7; it stipulates that the apprentice must believe s/he is able to remove the pump. This stipulation leads the expert and apprentice to have a subsidiary (partial) SharedPlan for the apprentice to know how to perform the flywheel removal action (i.e., have the recipe for doing so). Utterances (3) and (4) in the dialogue relate to this subsidiary SharedPlan. This clarification subdialogue corresponds to one type of knowledge precondition for action, the requirement of knowing the recipe for an action to be able to do that action. Another type of clarification dialogue can result from the knowledge precondition that an agent needs to be able to identify the objects that participate in an action; the elided subdialogue about setscrews in Figure 2 is just such a knowledge-precondition clarification subdialogue. With Utterance (5), the apprentice closes off these subdialogues and opens a new one related to pulling off the flywheel. The focus spaces containing representations of the setscrews are popped from the stack so that only the flywheel and, after Utterance (6), the wheelpuller are in focus when Utterance (8) occurs. They are the objects relevant to determining the referent of “the screw in the center.”Even in this era of big data, machine learning, and efforts to build end-to-end dialogue systems, theoretical work on dialogue can provide guidance for systems design and testing. Interestingly, in a different AI domain, Shoham has argued persuasively for the usefulness of logically sound theories for design of interactive systems (Shoham, 2015). A major challenge in applying the theories of dialogue structure and collaboration I have described in current dialogue systems, though, is that such systems typically will not have the kinds of detailed planning and recipe knowledge that Lochbaum’s approach required. Allen’s work on TRAINS (Allen et al., 1995) and Traum’s negotiation dialogue systems (Traum et al., 2008) have developed ways to limit the amount of domain knowledge needed. I will digress briefly to show an alternative, design-oriented approach to deploying the principles these theories establish in dialogue systems. To do so, I need to sketch the way we have used the theory of collaboration in a similarly plan-knowledge poor setting to yield design principles for information sharing in the context of our work on health care coordination (Amir et al., 2013).There are multiple ways one can deploy the kind of theoretical frameworks these theories provide. They can serve to generate system specifications or portions of them, as represented by Kamar’s Ph.D. research on interruption management (Kamar, Gal, and Grosz, 2009; Kamar, 2010; Kamar, Gal, and Grosz, 2013). They can guide design, as they have in recent research on collaborative interfaces for exploratory learning environments (Gal et al., 2012; Amir and Gal, 2013; Uzan et al., 2015; Segal et al., 2017). They can also provide an analytic framework for understanding behavior before design or for performance analysis. Our health care work deployed SharedPlans in these last two ways. In work with Stanford pediatricians, we are developing methods to improve information sharing among the 12–15 care providers typically involved in meeting the ongoing heath care needs of children with complex conditions.Formative interviews with parents of such children, physicians, and therapists revealed several characteristics of teamwork in this setting that not only raise challenges for coordination, but also make for a poor fit with prior AI planning methods (Amir et al., 2015). Based on these characteristics, we dubbed this kind of teamwork FLECS, because the team has a flat structure (no one is in charge); the team’s activities are loosely coupled, have extended duration, and are continually being revised; and team members typically act in a syncopated manner, not synchronously. As a result, team members have very little of the detailed knowledge of each other’s plans required by value-of-information approaches to determining what information to share. Figure 9 shows a mapping between SharedPlans constraints, designated by italics, and the kinds of capabilities they suggest a system should provide to a health care team in light of the extreme locality of information about tasks in FLECS teamwork. This analysis led Amir in her Ph.D. research to develop an interaction-based algorithm to support information sharing for the FLECS teamwork settings (Amir, Grosz, and Gajos, 2016).For systems to reply appropriately to people and in a way that makes sense in an extended dialogue, it will be crucial to get the structure and intentions right. Doing so will matter for linguistic form and for content. Figure 10 enumerates some possible ways to use SharedPlans principles to ameliorate flaws in the behavior of current dialogue systems that are based on machine learning of various sorts. The top list shows some ways in which dialogue structure can derive from participants’ decision making and from their activities. The second list shows ways in which participants’ commitments, abilities, and needs might give rise to dialogue structure. Regardless of a dialogue system’s underlying implementation methods, incorporating into the design of these methods some knowledge of dialogue structure and collaboration could improve the system, just as adding knowledge of syntactic structure or semantic relations seems to help squashing algorithms perform better (Peng, Thomson, and Smith, 2017), and hierarchical reinforcement learning (Georgila, Nelson, and Traum, 2014) overcomes some of the incoherence of dialogue systems based on flat reinforcement learning. Encouraging results of recent work on incorporating centering-like information into generative models for coreference resolution in text processing (Ji et al., 2017) also provides support for pursuing this research direction.Two themes have guided my dialogue research from its start: people matter and language itself matters. The characteristics of dialogue that I have described raise challenges for current systems. They are the reason that open domains (e.g., social chatbots, Twitter) are harder to handle than closed domains (travel assistants, customer service) and that short dialogues (Q/A pair) are easier than extended dialogue. Real human dialogues, though, are typically extended, and people frequently stray outside of any closed domain as their needs shift from those expected by system designers. To build systems capable of conversing sensibly with people requires close observation and analysis of ways people talk with one another, collecting data in real situations, and celebrating the full glory of language use rather than building systems that require people to control their language use. The extraordinary progress in computational linguistics recently argues for being more ambitious in our scientific and engineering goals. Some challenges I hope researchers will take on include:How can we integrate the fundamental principles of dialogue and collaboration models with data-driven machine-learning approaches?How can we build generalizable models that transfer from one domain to another, given the handcrafting required by semantic-grammar based systems and the large amounts of dialogue data machine learning methods would require (e.g., for incorporating dialogue purpose in their models)?How can we meet the societal needs of handling dialogue across the full range of natural languages and different cultures?How can researchers help ensure that research results are better integrated into deployed systems, so that they do not make avoidable errors, potentially causing ethical problems?Computational linguistics and natural-language processing systems also raise some of the most serious ethical challenges at the current moment. In addition to the potential harm of dialogue system failure, these challenges include the effect of social chatbots on ways people communicate with one another and of systems inadequately performing jobs like customer service costing people in time and effort. A principle that is derivable from the intentions included in the SharedPlans specification is that agents cannot commit to doing an activity that they know they are incapable of doing. This principle is one every dialogue system should obey, but few current systems do. The dialogue fragment in Figure 1 is annoying or humorous, depending on one’s perspective. Other kinds of mistakes made by current dialogue systems, though, are not just awkward or annoying, but raise ethical concerns. Students in the course I mentioned earlier have found serious, potentially life-threatening errors in their investigations of personal assistant systems and in toys that claim to be dialogue capable. For instance, based on experiences of talking with each other, people naturally generalize from individual instances of language capability. So, we would expect that a system able to answer the question “Where is the nearest ER?” would also be able to provide answers to “Where can I get a flu shot?” and “Where can I go to get a sprained ankle treated?”. Unfortunately, there are systems that fail on such seemingly related questions. Providing a list of web pages that describe how to treat a sprained ankle, as one system students tested did, may not be so serious for a sprained ankle, but a similar failure could be disastrous were the question about a heart attack or other serious medical condition.Just as capabilities for collaboration cannot be patched on but must be designed in from the start (Grosz, 1996), so too ethics must be taken into account from the start of system design. So, I will end by asking readers to think about the data they use, the systems they build, and the claims they make about those systems from an ethical perspective, and to do so from the initial stages of their formulating the design of these systems.I thank ACL, the people who nominated and recommended me for this honor, and the selection committee. I am awed to join the company of earlier awardees, a list that includes many people whose work I have greatly admired from my earliest days in computational linguistics. Eva Hajicova, Aravind Joshi, and Karen Sparck Jones, in particular, taught me a great deal about language structure and function, and their work and advice helped shape my research on dialogue.Alan Kay inspired my move from theoretical areas of computer science to AI, by suggesting as a thesis topic the challenge of building a system that would read a children’s story and then re-tell it from one character’s point of view. (This challenge remains open so far as I know.) Around the time I realized that children’s stories, full as they are of cultural and social lessons, were more difficult to understand than ordinary discourse, Bill Paxton and Ann Robinson lured me to the SRI speech understanding group. The challenge they posed to me was to build the discourse and pragmatics components of the SRI speech system. Everyone involved in the early 1970s speech systems efforts recognized that their systems needed to take context into account, but no one had yet formulated ways to operationalize context in a natural-language system. Bill and Ann argued (correctly) that task-oriented dialogue was simpler than children’s stories and (incorrectly, at least at the time) that speech was easier than text because it carried more information. They along with Jane Robinson and Gary Hendrix gave me a natural-language processing platform on which I could explore various approaches to dialogue models, and they taught me a great deal about AI and linguistics, neither of which I had formally studied. Led by Don Walker, the SRI speech group was an amazingly supportive research environment, one that inspired my approach to leading my own research group, and also to building computer science efforts at Harvard.My research has been enriched greatly by collaborations with Candy Sidner, a partner in developing the tripartite model of discourse structure and the initial SharedPlans model of collaborative plans; with Julia Hirschberg, whose work convinced me the time had become right for integrating dialogue models with speech and intonation; and with Sarit Kraus, a partner in generalizing SharedPlans and investigations of teamwork. The students, postdoctoral fellows, and younger colleagues with whom I have worked have enabled the research advances described in this paper, inspired me, and enriched my academic life. I have been fortunate throughout these years to work with superb Harvard students, undergraduate and graduate, and also with students based in other universities whose interest in dialogue or in collaboration led them to ask me to join their dissertation committees and even to become unofficial advisers. I thank them all for their science and for the joy they brought to our investigations.In the talk on which this paper is based, I also revealed some lessons I learned as my career progressed, which I have tried to pass on to my own students. I include brief mention of them here in hopes they will encourage subsequent generations of graduate students and other early career stage researchers to tackle hard, important problems, and to persist in investigating novel approaches unpopular though they may seem at first. One lesson is not to be discouraged too easily by the skepticism of senior researchers, who may have their own biases and be wrong. When he heard about my thesis research, Noam Chomsky remarked that it was an interesting problem but advised I would never succeed because dialogue could not be formalized. John McCarthy told me an understanding of people’s cognitive processes was irrelevant to AI, and I failed to convince him that it did matter if one was interested in language use. A second lesson is to persist despite negative feedback from peers about the importance of a problem. When Sidner and I first presented SharedPlans, arguing that AI models of planning for individual agents would not suffice for modeling collaborations, several AI planning and reasoning researchers suggested we just think harder. Some of them later developed their own teamwork models, having realized we were right. Einstein said “To raise new questions, new possibilities, to regard old problems from a new angle requires creative imagination and marks real advances in science.” (Einstein and Infeld, 1938). With the increasing prevalence of computer systems communicating in natural languages and being used to analyze human language for all manner of features, the importance of addressing the deepest problems of language and communication has become even greater than it was when I first ventured down the path of discovering ways to operationalize context.",1,0

"Abstract Social impairments are the sine qua non of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, children with ASD are capable of forming reciprocal friendships and many people with ASD have a strong desire for friends. Developing and maintaining friendships is associated with many important outcomes, including improved quality of life, mental health, and academic achievement. Children with ASD often attend groups to improve social skills, but strategies for building and maintaining friendships are not consistently addressed or measured following intervention. In this article, our objective is to build an understanding of peer relationships and friendships in school-aged children with ASD and how to best support them. In this article, we describe characteristics of peer relationships and friendships for children with ASD. We discuss current research findings on intervention to improve social skills, peer relationships, and friendships in school-aged children with ASD. Finally, we give suggestions for clinical practice and future research.",1,0

"The article substantiates the socio-economic and cultural-historical introduction of the Ossetians to the Russian language, which is considered as the result of the natural development of the standard of living of the highlanders. The aim of the study is to consider the history and characteristics of national-Russian bilingualism, the role of language interaction in the formation of a bilingual personality, society, identification of deformed linguistic processes that led to both the loss of the function of language proficiency and its use in everyday life, as well as measures that contribute to the revival of native language. The article emphasizes that the Russian language has become a civilizing factor that has significantly accelerated the development of the spiritual culture of the mountaineers, that it, along with the Ossetian language, is recognized as the state language of the Republic of North Ossetia-Alania as a language of interethnic communication, it is provided with free functioning throughout the republic. The work also focuses on the ethno-demographic composition of the population, emphasizes the polyethnicity of the region, which contributes to the strengthening of the role of the Russian language as a language of interethnic communication. During the 20th century, a sharp delimitation of the functions of the Russian and native languages leads to a weakening of the role of the national language, which exposes it to the threat of extinction. Loss of language entails a loss of self-awareness, culture, perception of the world, as well as the loss of self-identification. According to the authors, the republic itself needs to be concerned about the widespread use and all-round development of the native language in national government bodies, public organizations of science, culture, education, health care and the service sector. We need to work with those native speakers who do not consider it prestigious to communicate in their native language in the family, do not try to pass it on to the next generation: the lack of linguistic continuity is destructive. To preserve the language in the context of globalization, the authors propose to strengthen the role of the state and society, to consolidate the efforts of scientists, statesmen and public figures in order to influence the activities of the media to preserve the language and culture; direct their efforts towards harmonious bilingualism.",1,0

"Los términos numéricos en el uso lingüístico no siempre reciben una interpretación exacta. A veces los hablantes de la lengua hacen lecturas intervalares como al menos o cuando mucho. Por ello este fenómeno ha capturado la atención de diversos estudiosos y ha generado un gran debate tanto a nivel teórico como empírico (Horn, 1972, Geurts, 2006; Carston, 2004). La investigación que aquí se presenta tuvo como objetivo estudiar experimentalmente el nivel de aceptación de lecturas intervalares cuando el término numérico es antecedido por un artículo definido, cuando tiene función semántica de predicado o cuantificador, y cuando se encuentra bajo el alcance de algún operador modal epistémico o deóntico. Los resultados sugieren que en ausencia de un contexto pragmático que sesgue hacia las interpretaciones intervalares, éstas tienen un bajo nivel de aceptación. Sin embargo, en contextos modales epistémicos y deónticos débiles sí existe una aceptación de las lecturas acotadas superiormente.",1,0

"Mandatives:Lessons on raising/control diagnostics Michael Barrie and Christine Pittman 1. Introduction At first blush, mandative infinitival constructions (1) in English (Quirk and Greenbaum 1973) take on the appearance of control constructions based on traditional raising/control diagnostics. (1) a. Mary ordered John to peel the grapes. b. John commanded Mary to wash the star fruit. c. Mary obliged John to slice the papaya. d. Mary permitted John to core the apple. There are a number of important differences between mandatives and control predicates. First, unlike most control predicates, mandatives do not allow a partial control reading (Wurmbrand 2001:241, 247). (2) a. John ordered Mary to go to the opera (*together). b. Susan obliged Fred to *meet/*gather/wait in the lobby. This is surprising since mandatives do not fit neatly in Landau's (2000) class of control verbs that do not allow partial control, namely modals, aspectuals, and implicatives, which take so-called tenseless infinitives. We employ a variety of traditional diagnostics (mostly derived from Perlmutter and Soames 1978) to show that the mandatives instead pattern with raising-to-object verbs. Crucially for the analysis we lay out, the subject of the embedded clause is not θ-marked by the matrix verb. However, we argue that these predicates have an additional requirement. This usually leads to the interpretation of an implicit (pragmatically determined) goal of mandation (i.e., an orderee). This goal of mandation is often equivalent to the embedded subject (thus the appearance of control) but is not necessarily the embedded subject, as we illustrate below. [End Page 131] The remainder of the squib is organized as follows. Section 2 argues that mandatives such as order, command, and oblige are raising-to-object predicates. Section 3 presents a suggestion for the argument structure of mandatives. Section 4 is a brief conclusion. 2. Mandatives Are Raising-To-Object Verbs This section examines the standard diagnostics for raising versus control showing that they give mixed results for mandatives. We argue that the requirement that mandatives have an implicit goal of mandation interferes with some of the standard tests. Once these interfering factors are controlled for, the diagnostics clearly show these predicates to be raising verbs. 2.1 Non-thematic subjects Mandatives are usually thought to pattern with control verbs and not with raising-to-object verbs in terms of their ability to occur with non-thematic subjects. The following examples show that weather-it is not permitted in control constructions, but is permitted in raising constructions, respectively. (3)*John persuaded it to snow. (4) John expected it to snow. On the surface, mandatives seem to pattern with control (3) and not with raising-to-object (4). (5)*John ordered/commanded/required/permitted it to snow. However, non-thematic there shows a different pattern. Again, expletives are not permitted with control constructions but are available in raising constructions. (6)*John persuaded there to be fruit available at the reception. (7) John expected there to be fruit available at the reception. (8) John ordered/required/commanded/permitted there to be fruit available at the reception. Example (8) shows that the expletive there is available to mandatives. The following examples were found on various websites using Google.1 Similar data can easily be found with other mandative verbs. (9) There is no known evidence however that Arnold Palmer (the ""King"") ordered there to be any harm done to him. (imademymark.blogspot.com/2005/04/tiger-woods-is-god.html) (10) In the 5th century Bishop Memertus of Vienne ordered there to be processions of prayer on these days . . . (nottinghamchurches.org/seasons/pentecost.htm) (11) The local Commissar had ordered there to be no fraternising with the British . . .

(www.may4archive.org/plainview.shtml) (13) . . . and so the local landowner ordered there to be a disputation. (www.ling.upenn.edu/~beatrice/humor/royte.html) The question now is why (5) is ungrammatical. The proposal that mandatives contain an obligatory and implicit goal of mandation...",1,0

"A much underused resource in the study of Early American English is the anecdotal commentaries provided by the rather large number of contemporary journals which often provide evidence about an important issue in Early American English. This paper addresses the question of “leveling” in Colonial American English: did it take place, and, if so, when, where, and in what form, and shows how at least one contemporary journal provides rather impressive indications of the presence of strong, entrenched dialect differences at the turn ot the 18th century, suggesting that leveling, at least on the scale sometimes assumed by modern commentators, had not occurred by Madam Knight's day.",1,0

"یکی از پرسش‌های اساسی در حوزه دسترسی واژگانی و چگونگی بازشناسی واژه­ها در واژگان ذهنی، این است که سخنگوی زبان هنگام مواجهه با واژه­های پیچیده جدید، چگونه می‌تواند به معنای آن دسترسی پیدا کند و عوامل موثر بر سرعت این دسترسی کدامند؟ 
پژوهش حاضر به صورت تجربی برخی از عوامل مؤثر بر سرعت دسترسی به واژه­های مشتق را در ذهن گویشوران زبان فارسی محک زده و با انجام یک آزمون تصمیم گیری واژگانی بر روی 60 نفر از گویشوران تحصیل کرده زبان فارسی زمان واکنش و درصد خطای تعدادی از واژه­های مشتق (پیشوندی و پسوندی) و تعدادی واژه­نما را با هم مقایسه کرده است و تأثیر سه عامل بسامد کل واژه، بسامد پایه واژه و شمار خانوادگی ریشه رابر میزان سرعت و صحت دسترسی به واژه، در ذهن فارسی زبانان مورد سنجش قرار داده ­است. شناخت این گونه عوامل و رعایت اصول آن در امر واژه­گزینی می‌تواند میزان پذیرش واژه­های جدید را در جامعه فارسی­زبان افزایش دهد. نتایج نشان داد که عامل بسامد کل واژه به گونه­ای معنادار زمان واکنش به واژه های مشتق را تسریع بخشیده و درصد خطا را نیز کاهش می­دهد اما عوامل بسامد پایه و شمار خانوادگی ریشه معنادار نبودند. مقاله حاضر با استناد به نتایج به دست آمده راهکارهایی برای ارتقاء سطح پذیرش روان‌شناختی واژه­های گزینش شده فرهنگستان زبان پیشنهاد می­کند.",1,0

"La polysémie constitue un moyen important de lʼéconomie linguistique. Si les langues de spécialité ne disposent pas dʼun terme spécifique, elles trouvent la solution dans le vocabulaire général auquel elles empruntent des mots comprenant de nombreuses acceptions. Lʼune dʼelles sera précisée dʼaprès les besoins du domaine en question. Dans le présent article, nous rendons compte de lʼinterpénétration existant entre le vocabulaire du droit pénal français (issu de Code de procédure pénale et de Vocabulaire juridique), le vocabulaire général et dʼautres vocabulaires de spécialité. Les approches contemporaines de la terminologie qui prennent en considération les dimensions discursive, sociale, cognitive et culturelle permettent dʼaborder le terme avec plus de flexibilité et de ne pas le considérer comme une simple étiquette destinée à classer les connaissances. Les migrations qui sʼeffectuent entre vocabulaire général et vocabulaires de spécialité, connues sous les noms de terminologisation et déterminologisation,sʼaccompagnent des modifications sémantiques. En fonction du contexte et du domaine spécialisé, un mot peut avoir des acceptions différentes. A titre dʼexemple, le mot blanchiment ne renverra pas à la même notion pour un agent qui lutte contre la criminalité financière, un horticulteur, un cuisinier, un photographe ou un dentiste. Nous nous proposons de vérifier à quel point la polysémie externe est un phénomène répandu. Notre objectif est dʼexplorer ces transferts sémantiques, cʼest-à-dire les diverses facettes dʼun terme",1,0

"Abstract Impoliteness can be defined as the use of “communicative strategies” which are “designed to attack face, and thereby cause social conflict and disharmony” (Culpeper et al. 2003, 1564). The present study applies Jonathan Culpeper’s (2011a) model of “impoliteness” supplemented by the notions of jocular mockery, jocular abuse, and recipients’ responses (Bousfield 2008, 2010, Haugh and Bousfield 2012) to the Egyptian TV show Abla Fahita. Abla Fahita (Egyptian Arabic: أبلة فاهيتا‎ [ʾabla fāhīta]) is a puppet character that has regularly appeared on Egyptian television since 2011. The show is hugely popular and has been phenomenally successful, being watched on average by millions, according to the Egyptian Centre for Research on Public Opinion. It should be noted, however, that, due to the conservative nature of Egyptian culture, Abla Fahita and other similar TV shows are considered to violate Egyptian politeness standards radically. Hence, such shows have been condemned as degrading and of low moral standards and have been accused of causing a deterioration in the standards of Egyptian public taste. Despite all denunciations, Abla Fahita still enjoys a huge audience and dominates broadcast ratings. Part of the show’s popularity can be ascribed to its characteristic impoliteness, particularly Abla Fahita’s off-beat expressions in mocking her guests and her use of sexual innuendo, which is seen as entertaining by many viewers. The study, which reveals that Abla Fahita employs what can be called a humorous-impoliteness formula to entertain viewers, is an attempt to apply contemporary Impoliteness Theory across cultures, and to Colloquial Egyptian Arabic in particular.",1,0

"Even as naming rituals stand among the most persistent themes in African-American literature, Imamu Amiri Baraka's Dutchman, the most important play of the 1960s Black Arts Movement, is singular in the centrality of naming to its dramatic structure and meaning. From the profusion of over thirty-five different names, epithets, and appellations with which Lula (a young white female) and Clay (a young African-American male) manipulate and vitiate each other, we construct a taxonomy of three separate, interconnected naming rituals for analyzing the dramatic functions of naming in Dutchman: an Ethnic Cleansing Ritual, a Sexual and Gender Dissolution ritual, and an Existential Negation ritual. Each naming ritual reveals its own truth about. the overarching conflicts of the drama and, in tandem with the other naming rituals, elucidates Dutchman's links to its predecessors in both canonical African-American writing and modern European existentialist drama.",1,0

"ATHLETICS, Bees, Browns, Cardinals, Cubs, Dodgers, Giants, Indians, 1< Phillies, Pirates, Reds, Red Sox, Senators, Tigers, White Sox, YankeesI These nicknames of the sixteen major league baseball teams have become household words throughout the nation and are as typically American as the national pastime itself. They flash across the sports pages of thousands of newspapers almost the year round and are in the minds and on the tongues of millions of men, women and children in Spring, Summer, Fall and Winter. There are good reasons for the popularity of these sobriquets. They are a boon to newspaper headline writers, for they serve as helpful synonyms to fit space requirements. They are colorful, 'technical,' and authoritative terms in baseball conversation and baseball writing. They avoid confusion and save words when referring to a team in a city that has representatives in both leagues-Giants in any baseball fan's language means the New Y4rk National League club, and Yankees, or Yanks, means the New York American League club. How did these nicknames originate? Several were coined by newspapermen; some sprang from the enthusiastic comment of fans. Princeton University was indirectly responsible for one, and an 'act of piracy' for another. A few go back to another century, and one is as modern as 1936.",1,0

"In recent years, the study of negation has motivated an impressive amount of work devoted to the study of the grammatical representation of sentential negation and its implications for syntactic and semantic theory (see the bibliography in Horn and Kato 2000 for a reasonably exhaustive compilation). The current volume includes twelve papers, the majority presented at a conference in Leiden in late 1994, that examine a range of intersecting issues in the historical development of modern English negation. While the papers are ordered alphabetically in the volume, they fall into two natural classes as defined by theoretical or descriptive orientation: four are explicitly directed to current issues in generative theory, while the remaining eight are of a more purely descriptive nature, although these papers contain sufficient detail to be of interest to practitioners of a variety of grammatical frameworks.

"En el presente trabajo se analizan distintas funciones que el lenguaje vago expresa en conversaciones informales entre jovenes argentinos, y las razones estrategicas que pueden llevar a un hablante a utilizarlo. El corpus analizado pertenece al proyecto Cohesion y coherencia en la interaccion coloquial (Universidad Nacional de La
Plata, Argentina) y consta de sesenta conversaciones espontaneas entre alumnos universitarios de 18 a 28 anos de edad. Para este analisis se partio de los principios del Sistema de Valoracion (White 2000, Martin y White 2005, Hood y Martin 2005), planteados en el ambito de la
Linguistica Sistemico Funcional. Se recurrio a bibliografia especifica sobre lenguaje vago (Channell 1994; Cutting 2007) y a estudios del lenguaje juvenil (Rodriguez Gonzalez 2002; Stenstrom y otros 2002).

"In this paper we discuss advantages and disadvantages of e-dictionaries over print dictionaries in order to answer one increasingly relevant question: is digital always better? We compare the e-content from Oxford University Press and Merriam-Webster flagship dictionaries against their most recent print counterparts. The resulting data shows that the move from print to digital, against popular perception, results in a loss of lexicographical detail and scope. After assessing the user-friendliness of the e-dictionaries’ sites in both desktop and mobile app formats, we conclude that Merriam-Webster currently utilizes the digital medium somewhat better, while Oxford University Press is the current market leader in collaborations with tech giants such as Google. Most crucially, however, both companies have yet to devise and implement optimal ways to balance advertising noise and lexicographical content. Finally, we compare the virtual popularity of e-dictionaries according to their social media efforts and product partnerships. The greatest problem e-dictionaries currently face is that content does routinely change in unspecified and even undocumented ways. Despite these significant disadvantages, the convenience of mobile online accessibility appears to outweigh the concern with the reliability and quality of content.",1,0

"Researchers and scientists have been conducting plenty of research on COVID-19 since its outbreak. Healthcare professionals, laboratory technicians, and front-line workers like sanitary workers, data collectors are putting tremendous efforts to avoid the prevalence of the COVID-19 pandemic. Currently, the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing strategy determines the COVID-19 virus. This RT-PCR processing is more expensive and induces violation of social distancing rules, and time-consuming. Therefore, this research work introduces generative adversarial network deep learning for quickly detect COVID-19 from speech signals. This proposed system consists of two stages, pre-processing and classification. This work uses the least mean square (LMS) filter algorithm to remove the noise or artifacts from input speech signals. After removing the noise, the proposed generative adversarial network classification method analyses the mel-frequency cepstral coefficients features and classifies the COVID-19 signals and non-COVID-19 signals. The results show a more prominent correlation of MFCCs with various COVID-19 cough and breathing sounds, while the sound is more robust between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 models. As compared with the existing Artificial Neural Network, Convolutional Neural Network, and Recurrent Neural Network, the proposed GAN method obtains the best result. The precision, recall, accuracy, and F-measure of the proposed GAN are 96.54%, 96.15%, 98.56%, and 0.96, respectively.",1,0

The last one, the Cambridge International Dic-tionary of English (henceforth CIDE), was a completely new dictionary.

"Resumen A fines del siglo XIX se produce un cambio fundamental en la prensa latinoamericana. El “modelo informativo” dejaba atras a la “prensa doctrinaria”, predominante desde la Independencia, asociado al nacimiento del mercado informativo y de los generos periodisticos modernos y relacionado con el proceso de autonomizacion del campo intelectual en general, lo que provoco la presencia de un nuevo tipo de escritor que encontro en la prensa y en la cronica un espacio de desarrollo, no exento de tensiones. Este texto analiza estos procesos a partir del caso de Jose Marti y su trabajo periodistico desde Nueva York para diarios latinoamericanos.

"Ayutla Mixtec is spoken in the state of Guerrero, Mexico. Robert Hills began fieldwork in the town of Tepango in January 1972 and has profited greatly from the extensive field notes and personal guidance given him by Leo Pankratz to whom grateful acknowledgment is hereby expressed. This study was carried out in collaboration with William Merrifield at the linguistic center of the Summer Institute of Linguistics in Mitla, Oaxaca, Mexico, in the fall of 1972. principal informant during this period was Sr. Cresencio Martinez of Tepango. orthography used is that presented in L. Pankratz and E. V. Pike, Phonology and Morphotonemics of Ayutla Mixtec, IJAL 33 (1967): 287-99, except that tone is indicated as follows: low tone (unmarked), mid tone by a grave accent ('), and high tone by an acute accent ('). 2 C.

"El presente trabajo examina la variaciÃ³n diatÃ³pica de la perÃ­frasis andar + GER, comparando su uso en el espaÃ±ol mexicano con el uso peninsular. Para ello, se analiza la frecuencia relativa de la misma en varios corpus y se estudian sus rasgos semÃ¡nticos y sintÃ¡cticos mÃ¡s destacados. El anÃ¡lisis cuantitativo, por una parte, pone de manifiesto la mayor frecuencia de andar + GER en el espaÃ±ol de MÃ©xico en comparaciÃ³n con el espaÃ±ol peninsular. Por otra parte, revela que la perÃ­frasis ocurre, sobre todo, en modalidades de lengua informales. En el plano semÃ¡ntico, el presente estudio confirma que, en perÃ­frasis de gerundio, el verbo andar ha ido perdiendo su significado lÃ©xico de movimiento fÃ­sico y ha llegado a transmitir valores pragmÃ¡ticos, particularmente de determinaciÃ³n y empeÃ±o. Asimismo, a diferencia del espaÃ±ol de EspaÃ±a, en el espaÃ±ol de MÃ©xico la perÃ­frasis estÃ¡ sometida a relativamente pocas restricciones selectivas respecto del gerundio, evoluciÃ³n que se fecha en Ã©pocas relativamente recientes. En el nivel sintÃ¡ctico, el proceso de gramaticalizaciÃ³n se manifiesta en la adyacencia del auxiliar y el gerundio, el orden interno fijo de los dos componentes de la perÃ­frasis, la subida de clÃ­ticos y la disminuciÃ³n de gerundios coordinados. El caso de andar + GER demuestra que la gramaticalizaciÃ³n de una misma construcciÃ³n puede desarrollarse de manera diferente segÃºn el entorno especÃ­fico dialectal. Al mismo tiempo y en un nivel mÃ¡s general, realza la importancia del enfoque diatÃ³pico en los estudios sobre las perÃ­frasis verbales y los procesos de gramaticalizaciÃ³n.",1,0
"This article describes a controlled experiment designed to determine what people listen to specifically when judging a speaker's sexuality. Four experimental stimuli were produced by digitally shortening the syllable duration and narrowing the pitch of one male speaker reading a passage. Listeners rated various combinations of the four stimuli on 10 affective scales, including straight/gay and effeminate/masculine. Altering the two variables was insufficient to alter listeners' perceptions of the speaker's sexuality to a level of significance. However, significant correlations between the different attitudinal scales illustrated that perceptions of sexuality are ideologically linked to other perceptions of personality and personhood.",1,0

"According to the influential “Two Visual Pathways” hypothesis, the cortical visual system is segregated into two pathways, with the ventral, occipitotemporal pathway subserving object perception, and the dorsal, occipitoparietal pathway subserving the visuomotor control of action. However, growing evidence suggests that the dorsal pathway also plays a functional role in object perception. In the current article, we present evidence that the dorsal pathway contributes uniquely to the perception of a range of visuospatial attributes that are not redundant with representations in ventral cortex. We describe how dorsal cortex is recruited automatically during perception, even when no explicit visuomotor response is required. Importantly, we propose that dorsal cortex may selectively process visual attributes that can inform the perception of potential actions on objects and environments, and we consider plausible developmental and cognitive mechanisms that might give rise to these representations. As such, we consider whether naturalistic stimuli, such as real-world solid objects, might engage dorsal cortex more so than simplified or artificial stimuli such as images that do not afford action, and how the use of suboptimal stimuli might limit our understanding of the functional contribution of dorsal cortex to visual perception.",1,0
"En islandais, les nouveaux verbes acquierent, selon l'A., leur structure argumentale de trois manieres : 1. par emprunt d'une structure argumentale a une langue source, 2. par attraction regroupee et 3. par attraction isolee.

"Although Covid-19 has been framed using all manner of metaphors, an as-yet under-examined question is how the spreading virus might itself serve as a metaphor and what purpose this might serve. The article redresses this deficit by identifying shared experiences of the mobile virus as the basis for a metaphorical framework for evaluating and judging human behaviour, including alleged rule-breaking, during the pandemic. The article traces the appearance of the metaphor spreading across a broad spectrum of sources that includes political speech, the reporting of crime in prosecutorial and local media sources, judicial opinion and poetry. We observe in some limited contexts a straightforward metaphoric transfer or substitution between mobile people and the mobile virus. In a greater number and variety contexts, we find instead more subtle signs of the metaphor: the censuring of bad behaviour and the justifying of coercive treatment using the metonymic elements of the virus’s spread: its characteristic unpredictability, speed, agility, irrepressibility, and relentlessness.",1,0

"This volume is a selection of essays by the late Cecily Clark, the great onomastic scholar whose published writings span five decades. Clark’s name will be familiar to most of those whose work focuses on medieval England-whether they are historians, philologists, numismatists, glossographers, or onomasts-and to many others as well, such is the breadth and quality of her work. The present volume contains a selection of Clark’s essays, chosen by her friends and colleagues, and served up in six courses: dStudies in History, Literature and Language,d dEssays in Onomasticsd (subdivided into dPrinciples and Methodology,d dPost-Conquest England : General Studies,d and dPost-Conquest England: Case Studiesd), dThe Liber Vitae of Thomey Abbey,d and dDiversions and Reviews.d There is also an introduction by the editor, an essay in appreciation of Clark by Peter Clemoes (made more poignant by Clemoes’s own recent death), a Clark bibliography and c.v., and useful indices of medieval personal names, modern personal names, place names, words and phrases (subdivided by language), and manuscripts. I have only three negative comments about this book, and they are minor. First, several of the gatherings in the copy of the book I received for review were loose and kept flopping about. Second, insular g is represented throughout by the numeral 3, set on the line for upper case and subscripted for lower case, instead of by a proper yogh (3); such typesetting would be more appropriate to the age of the typewriter than the age of the computer. Third, there are more typographical errors than one would like to see. This last defect is usually merely annoying and does not produce any semantic difficulties, as when the word Wincesterleode is broken by hyphenation in the middle of a diphthong (Wincesterle-ode,12) orbeodscypes in the middle of a consonant (jJeods-cypes, 13). Occasionally, the result is nonsense, as wton for waeron (12). (Lest this give the wrong impression, I should mention that pages 12-14 are by far the worst offenders, other typographical errors only occurring sporadically throughout the rest of the volume.) There is one other possible typographical error that bears mentioning, though it might also represent an interpretive error or",1,0

"Recent research on medical communication discusses the role of argumentation in building physician-patient consensus to enhance shared decision-making. This paper focuses on the potential of using argumentation to establish the preliminary step of shared understanding of the diagnosis. This understanding is important in helping patients accept the disease and in increasing their involvement in care. We conducted an in-depth analysis of an observation of a medical encounter, triangulated with interviews with all participants, to illustrate how the lack of clear information and argumentation concerning the disease hindered the patient’s understanding and acceptance of it. This in turn led to difficulties in building a trusting relationship and in reaching treatment decisions. We discuss how using argumentation focused on the disease can allow a fruitful patient-centered discussion about the medical condition and treatment options.",1,0

"Alabama House Bill (HB) 56 passed in 2011 and was written by Kris Kobach. The bill targets migrant groups, pressuring them to “self-deport”. Kobach’s language subjugates migrants in a way that defines their bodies with shame. I am interested in how Goodnight and Natanson conceive of risk in the practice of social argumentation. For that, I employ philosophical perspectives of affect to reconsider language as relational, and demonstrate how affective language moves bodies. I then consider the channeling of affect and the ways negative affects get strategically directed at defined subject-individuals, shifting presumption of not belonging onto those bodies exhibiting migrant characteristics within the state. Affect, modulated through language, creates affective boundaries, and I demonstrate how Kobach obliges citizens of Alabama to participate in both the shaming of the undocumented migrant and the maintenance of the affective boundary keeping the undocumented migrant body from citizenship.",1,0

"Speech acts, as basic communication units in pragmatics, are highly correlated to speakers’ communicative intentions. It is a worthwhile goal to explore whether they obey some linguistic laws that reflect people’s cognitive mechanisms, e.g. Zipf’s Law. However, few studies have examined whether the Zipf distribution can capture the frequencies of speech acts, and whether its parameters can show how speakers’ attributes (e.g. gender and education level) relate to the use of speech acts. As a preliminary attempt to bridge this gap, the current study finds from the data sample of the Switchboard Dialog Act Corpus that: (1) the Zipf distribution well captures the distribution of speech acts; (2) the parameter a can distinguish the dialogues between speakers of different genders, and it shows a regularity of the highest frequency of an SA in a dialogue to some degree; (3) the parameter b can differentiate speakers of different education levels – people with college-level education may have higher expressivity of SAs compared with those with higher-than-college-level education. This study shows that Zipf’s Law can be extended to the analysis of pragmatic phenomena, which may become part of the synergetic system of language through the approach of Quantitative Linguistics.",1,0

A partir del uso de una metodología cualitativa, con instrumentos como la entrevista y la observación, se busca conocer cómo las actitudes lingüísticas de los padres contribuyen al mantenimiento o la pérdida del español. Los resultados indican que las familias de las dos nacionalidades muestran actitudes positivas hacia el español, pero sus motivaciones difieren. Los padres de familias colombianas muestran una motivación instrumental, ya que ven el español como herramienta para conseguir mejores oportunidades laborales. Los padres de familias mexicanas se muestran más flexibles a su uso en casa y lo aceptan con menos prejuicios que las familias colombianas. Todos los padres manifiestan tener una motivación integrativa, presentan una fuerte identidad grupal, intentan transmitir a sus hijos sentimientos positivos hacia el español y la cultura hispana.",1,0

"We present methods for reducing the worst-case and typical-case complexity of a context-free parsing pipeline via hard constraints derived from finite-state pre-processing. We perform O(n) predictions to determine if each word in the input sentence may begin or end a multi-word constituent in chart cells spanning two or more words, or allow single-word constituents in chart cells spanning the word itself. These pre-processing constraints prune the search space for any chart-based parsing algorithm and significantly decrease decoding time. In many cases cell population is reduced to zero, which we term chart cell “closing.” We present methods for closing a sufficient number of chart cells to ensure provably quadratic or even linear worst-case complexity of context-free inference. In addition, we apply high precision constraints to achieve large typical-case speedups and combine both high precision and worst-case bound constraints to achieve superior performance on both short and long strings. These bounds on processing are achieved without reducing the parsing accuracy, and in some cases accuracy improves. We demonstrate that our method generalizes across multiple grammars and is complementary to other pruning techniques by presenting empirical results for both exact and approximate inference using the exhaustive CKY algorithm, the Charniak parser, and the Berkeley parser. We also report results parsing Chinese, where we achieve the best reported results for an individual model on the commonly reported data set.",1,0

"This article addresses a long-standing clinical and theoretical debate regarding the potential relationship between speech and nonspeech behaviors in the developing system. The review is motivated by the high popularity of nonspeech oral motor exercises (NSOMEs), including alimentary behaviors such as chewing, in the treatment of speech disorders in young children. The similarities and differences in the behavioral characteristics, sensory requirements, and task goals for speech and nonspeech oromotor behaviors are compared. Integrated theoretical paradigms and empirical data on the development of early oromotor behaviors are discussed. Although the efficacy of NSOMEs remains empirically untested at this time, studies of typical developmental speech physiology fail to support a theoretical framework promoting the use of NSOMEs. Well-designed empirical studies are necessary, however, to establish the efficacy of NSOMEs for specific clinical population and treatment targets.",1,0

"Little research has explored individuals’ multilingual selves when learning a language other than English (LOTE) in conflict-affected situations. Therefore, this qualitative study sought to understand the motivation and ultimate vision of a group of internally displaced Syrians learning Turkish as an L3 or L4 in Afrin on the Syrian-Turkish border. The data were collected from the participants’ written narratives and two subsequent rounds of individual online semi-structured interviews. The data suggest that the participants’ desire to learn Turkish ranged from the need to secure a job in Afrin to reasons associated with achieving their ideal selves by imagining themselves working/studying at a Turkish university and being integrated into the Turkish community in future. The participants were proactive agents, recognising that attending Turkish private tutoring courses with under-qualified tutors was not sufficient to improve their language proficiency. They capitalised on the availability of technology-mediated learning artefacts and the support of some informal actors. This qualitative study has pedagogical implications and provides further evidence of the need for SLA research to serve all multilingual people, not just the privileged, by conducing empirical studies in non-affluent geographies.",1,0

"espanolEn Malasia, la responsabilidad social corporativa (CSR por sus siglas en ingles) es un ambito relativamente nuevo. Sin embargo, las corporaciones lo han introducido con el proposito de dar visibilidad a esta dimension. Un genero prototipico para dicho proposito es el llamado informe de responsabilidad social corporativa (CSR report, por sus siglas en ingles). Este articulo analiza la intertextualidad de estos informes, es decir, las referencias a otros textos, en informes de CSR en Malasia. Para ello se creo un corpus de CEO Statements (Carta del Principal Oficial Ejecutivo o CEO) y Environmental Sections (Seccion de Medio Ambiente) de informes de CSR y se estudiaron las palabras clave, con el fin de identificar las referencias a otros textos. La funcion de estos textos se examina dentro del contexto corporativo nacional. Estos informes contienen referencias explicitas a documentos (documentos de politica, reglamentos, informes, investigacion, estandares) y a individuos/grupos (los CEO, grupos de interes y organizaciones expertas). Los textos que se incorporan a estos informes muestran variacion en lo que respecta al control corporativo y se organizan de forma jerarquica, reflejando los intereses del gobierno y la demanda de la bolsa de comercio. Los textos no estan estandarizados y son relevantes para las corporaciones implicadas en la responsabilidad social corporativa, en tanto que los textos monitorizan y justifican sus actuaciones en este ambito. No obstante, los textos incorporados pueden perpetuar unas aseveraciones inexactas, dependiendo de que tipo de textos son y a que partes del texto se refiere. Dado que estos textos se han empleado para abordar con detalle las iniciativas y los resultados corporativos, los informes de responsabilidad social representan, en principio, la ‘verdad’ de cada corporacion respecto a dicho aspecto. Se concluye que la intertextualidad sirve por tanto para reforzar los intereses corporativos EnglishIn Malaysia, corporate social responsibility (CSR) is relatively new but corporations have been required to engage in and disclose their CSR. A typical genre for disclosure is CSR reports and these reports often refer to other texts. The article investigates the act of referencing to other texts or intertextuality in Malaysian CSR reports. It creates an archive of CEO Statements and Environment Sections in CSR reports and studies the archive for keywords, which can identify the incorporated texts. The function of these texts is examined in relation to Malaysia’s corporate context. CSR reports contain explicit references to documents (policies, regulations, reports, research, standards) and to individuals/groups (CEOs, stakeholders, expert organizations). The incorporated texts display variation in corporate control, which organizes these texts along an intertextual cline. The cline helps to identify corporate and non-corporate sources among the texts. The selection of incorporated texts may reflect government and stock exchange demands. The texts are not standardized and are relevant for the CSR domain and corporations, where these texts monitor and justify CSR performance. Yet, the incorporated texts may perpetuate inexact reporting because corporations select the texts and the parts of texts to refer to. Since these texts have been employed to scrutinize initiatives and results, CSR reports can claim to represent the “truth” about a corporation’s CSR. Hence, intertextuality serves corporate interests",1,0

"Working on the lexicography of isiXhosa has led to the interesting experience of discovering that the description of the lexicon of isiXhosa poses innumerable challenges of both a semantic and a non-semantic nature. The problems encountered, some of which this article is an account of, include lack of understanding of the nature, depth and volume of work involved in compiling dictionaries, complexities idiosyncratic to the language itself, factors affecting consistency in methodology and other aspects, as well as extra-linguistic issues like orthography, finance, technology and relevant skills. Some of the problems rise from the very recognition of the fact that dictionaries play a significant role in ""... eliminating obstacles in communication"" (Alberts 1992: 1) and the consequent desire or ambition to produce as perfect a dictionary as possible. Keywords: isixhosa, trilingual dictionary, multi-volume dictionary, cultural context, addenda, inclusion, authenticity, accuracy, language change, self created terms, indeterminacy, alphabetization, naturality, orthography, computer lexicography, research, language representativeness, language planning",1,0

"Using the tools of contemporary semiotic theory to analyze classical rabbinic hermeneutics and medieval mystical exegesis, Betty Rojtman unveils a striking modernity in these early forms of textual interpretation. The metaphor from rabbinic literature that describes the writing of the Torah - black fire on white fire - becomes, in Rojtman's analysis, a figure for the differential structures that can be found throughout rabbinic discourse. Moving through the successive levels of traditional commentary, from early Midrash to modern Kabbalah, Rojtman examines the tension between the fluidity and nuance of the biblical text and the fixed commitment to ideological and theological content. To examine this strain between open text and sacred language, Rojtman scrutinizes the demonstrative, this, as a word whose significance changes with every change in context. Her analysis suggests a double-layered meaning for this, which refers to the existential world in its multiplicity but also to transcendence and the eternal presence of God.",1,0

Les pratiques numériques ont été observées par le biais de captures d’écran vidéos réalisées sur téléphone portable, dans le cadre d’activités de production écrite. L’analyse montre que la participante, qui suit un enseignement d’anglais de spécialité, a développé des compétences spécifiques aux outils consultés, mais qu’elle éprouve des difficultés à en rendre compte.

"This volume brings together eleven papers presented at the 17th meeting of the Dictionary Society of North America (Indiana University, 2009). Nine of the papers were given within a seminar devoted specifically to learners’ dictionaries, and the cover notes inform us that this seminar ‘coincided with the rising interest in learners’ dictionaries in the United States and presented the first such debate by local and international scholars and practitioners’. The volume is the second in a series entitled ‘Papers on Lexicography and Dictionaries’. The ordering of the papers makes it clear that the editors wish to present the volume as a structured whole, rather than as a generically linked set of individual papers. The first three papers, listed below, are linked by a common theme, the publication in 2008 of Merriam-Webster’s Advanced Learner’s English Dictionary (mwaled), the first comprehensive monolingual learners’ dictionary (mld) to be produced by an American publisher.1 Paul Bogaards’ paper gives a brief intoduction to mwaled, but before and in preparation for this, the bulk of the paper provides a synthesis of the main characteristics of the (British) mld, both as it is today and in terms of its historical development. Dictionaries from the leading five publishers in this field are all discussed, in particular the innovations which have been made by new dictionaries on the market or by new editions. As part of the historical synthesis, comparison is made between two dictionaries at opposite ends of the chronological span, oald1 (1948) and oald7 (2005).",1,0

"If linguistics is to become a real science, it has to solve the problem of apprehending objective invariant relationships, i.e., empirical universals. This is the aim of current typology. However, the results often seem to be vague or shaky, because the approach lacks firm theoretical foundations and involves too many ill-defined, purely intuitive notions. It is possible to do more solidly grounded typological work. Comparison of languages requires, at the outset, the construction of arbitrary conceptual frameworks, founded on intuition, as an independent standard of comparison. On the other hand, subsequent work should take into account only observable morphosyntactic facts and their semantic correlates, and exclude intuition entirely. This approach avoids mixing speculation with objective observation: it thus lends itself to positive criticism, and should consequently be conducive to scientific progress. It is here exemplified by the study of transitivity in a cross-linguistic perspective. Transitivity is conceived of as a scalar property of predication, as in the theory of Hopper & Thompson; however, the approach is different and is claimed to have a more solid theoretical foundation.",1,0

"Der vorliegende Aufsatz hat zwei Ziele. Zum einen untersucht er die syntaktische, prosodischinformationsstrukturelle und semantisch-pragmatische Vielfalt adnominaler Relativsatze des Gegenwartsdeutschen anhand von vier Dimensionen der Nahe und Ferne zwischen Bezugsnominale und Relativsatz: Kontaktstellung vs. Distanzstellung, hypotaktischer vs. parataktischer Anknupfung, unselbstandiger vs. selbstandiger Phrasierung und Restriktivitat vs. Appositivitat. In der Relativsatz-Literatur finden sich zahlreiche Thesen uber Beschrankungen in der Kombinierbarkeit dieser Eigenschaften. Kaum eine davon halt jedoch einer genaueren Uberprufung stand, sodass der Aufsatz zu dem Fazit gelangt, dass deutsche Relativsatze wesentlich mehr Variation zulassen, als ublicherweise angenommen wird. Zweitens untersucht der Aufsatz eingehender die Opposition zwischen restriktiven und appositiven Relativsatzen. Auch uber diese wichtige Unterscheidung sind zahlreiche Annahmen in Umlauf, die sich als revisionsbedurftig erweisen. Es wird gezeigt, dass zwei weit verbreitete Unterscheidungskriterien nur bedingt anwendbar bzw. operationalisierbar sind: die Einschrankung des Referenzbereichs durch restriktive Relativsatze und das unterschiedliche Skopusverhalten. Stattdessen wird auf Unterscheidungskriterien gesetzt, die bisher eher wenig beachtet wurden: die Referentialitat des Relativpronomens und die Deskriptivitat des Bezugsnominales. Diese werden als entscheidende Faktoren fur die semantische Interpretation von Relativsatzen herausgestellt. Appositive Interpretation von Relativsatzen ist moglich, wenn ihr Relativpronomen referentiell gedeutet werden kann. Restriktive Interpretation von Relativsatzen ist moglich, wenn das Bezugsnominale eine deskriptive Komponente enthalt. Sind beide Bedingungen erfullt, so kann ein Relativsatz auf beide Arten gelesen werden. Dann muss pragmatisch zwischen den Interpretationsmoglichkeiten ausgewahlt werden.",1,0

"The objective of this research was to develop a preliminary Perceived Story Quality Index to assess laypersons' views of story quality. Research to date has not employed a standard measure of perceived quality, nor reported whether different lay-raters judge stories similarly. The study involved systematically generating core dimensions of perceived story quality and addressing whether (a) lay-raters of different ages and genders evaluate story quality consistently and (b) multiple dimensions of story quality form a general factor (i.e., an index). Sixteen lay-raters judged 129 autobiographical and fictional stories. Analyses show that young and older men and women lay-raters judged story quality consistently (i.e., share an implicit theory) and that quality ratings form a unitary factor. This structure holds for both types of stories and is maintained across age and gender. The discussion focuses on the scope and limitations of the developed preliminary Perceived Story Quality Index.",1,0

"In full passive sentences such as The cat was kicked by the dog , the patient (cat) is promoted to subject and the agent is demoted to the by -phrase. Children 2;10 to 4;7 years (mean 3;6) who were taught the form with animate patients and animate agents ( The baby is being picked up by the girl ) were better able to produce and comprehend passives than children taught with inanimate patients and animate agents ( The flower is being picked up by the girl ). The finding of comparable post-teaching performance in children taught with perceptually salient (coloured) VS. nonsalient patients argues against a salience explanation for the patient animacy effect. Moreover, equal access to word forms for animate and inanimate nouns did not reduce the effect. The animacy effect is consistent with claims that ‘perspective’ is the cognitive counterpart to the formal category of subject; and, conversely, inconsistent with attempts to understand language acquisition in terms of a language system that operates in isolation from other facets of human cognition.",1,0

"This study reconstructs the Alfredian network as consisting of twelve actors. This network is termed a coalition , within which a cluster of Mercian actors is further hypothesised. Historical sources and charter evidence suggest that Mercian scribes worked for West Saxon kings and may even have taken part in the establishment of a proto-chancery at the royal court. This writing office can be conjectured to have ties with the Alfredian coalition and described as a community of practice . The whole sociolinguistic reconstruction is supported by three case studies: Angelcynn ‘the English people’ and here ‘band, troop’ in historical-political genres, and gretan freondlice in epistolary genres. The diffusion of these Alfredian norms across time, place and genres is linked to the royal chancery and its distribution channels, as well as to the diachronic sustainability of linguistic practices within professional discourse communities and their archives.",1,0

"Bondage, discipline, sadism and masochism (BDSM) both fascinates and repulses. While some are fascinated by its images of leather-clad mistresses and masters inflicting pain on willing slaves for sexual pleasure (Yes Master!), they are often also repulsed because BDSM also evokes images of sadistic Nazis and serial killers. The chic images associated with the BDSM lifestyle seem to be more palatable (a light whipping, a gentle handcuffing), but actual BDSM practices (foot worship, impact play) are still not acceptable, and BDSM is most commonly associated with deviance. Despite this negative perception of BDSM by some people, there is a thriving BDSM scene in South Africa, and participants in BDSM communities show their belonging through a specific set of verbal and non-verbal tropes. In this article, I analyse these tropes using the ‘queer theory method’ as a theoretical springboard which allows me to engage with the multimodal meanings of BDSM bodies without being confined to essentialist, stereotyped or identity-based ideas about the intersection of gender, sexuality, and race.",1,0

"Quantitative linguistics (QL) is a discipline of linguistics, that, using real texts, studies languages with quantitative mathematical approaches, aiming to precisely describe and explain, with a system of mathematical laws, the operation and development of language systems. Later in this review, we will address the relationship between QL and computational linguistics. Quantitative Syntax Analysis is a recent work on QL by Reinhard Köhler that not only provides a comprehensive introduction to the work of QL on the syntactic level, but also sketches the theoretical grounds, the research paradigm, and the ultimate goals of quantitative linguistics in general.In the first chapter, Köhler points to the vital role of syntax in language: Syntax enables language users to code structures instead of ideas as wholes. A text embodies a complex cognitive formation and meets several basic requirements in human communication, which implies that language is not autonomous, but a dynamic communicative system used by human beings. Hence, the ultimate understanding and explanation of syntax (and the whole language system) depends on usage-based investigation of the cognitive basis and the functional requirements of language, which is somewhat neglected in many mainstream syntactic studies. Even in those cases where explanatory power is acknowledged as the ultimate goal of linguistic investigation, the necessary knowledge is still required as to what a scientific linguistic theory is and how such a theory may be built. So far, it is rare for quantitative means to be used in syntactic study. One reason is that many syntacticians are too addicted to the enshrined traditional paradigms that have been proven to be somewhat inadequate when it comes to processing real texts. And that is why in computational linguistics, “devout executors of the belief in strictly formal methods as opposed to statistical ones do not have any chance to succeed” (page 4).The second chapter, entitled “The Quantitative Analysis of Language and Text,” begins with an explanation of the difference between quantitative linguistics and the formal branches of linguistics that have once been widely used in computational linguistics: QL is concerned with the quantitative properties important for understanding the development and the operation of linguistic systems, whereas the formal branches of linguistics use only qualitative mathematical means and formal logics to model structural properties of language, overlooking, in most cases, the aspects of systems that exceed structure, viz., functions, dynamics, and processes. Köhler points out that the successes of modern natural sciences (the exact, testable statements, the precise predictions, and the copious applications) all derive from their instruments and their advanced models. This implies that these instruments and models, for which the quantitative parts of mathematics (probability theory and statistics, function theory, differential equations) are indispensable ingredients, are worth integrating into linguistics, which is the aim of QL.Chapter 3, entitled “Empirical Analysis and Mathematical Modeling,” reviews the important works of quantitative syntactic analysis. In the first section, Köhler gives a long list of the important syntactic units and properties defined within the frameworks of both phrase structure syntax and dependency syntax; this reflects the fact that researchers in both fields have been engaged in some fruitful quantitative studies. In Section 3.2, he defines quantitation of syntactic concepts as counting the objects under study, because syntactic analysis investigates only discrete objects. Section 3.4 is a detailed review of the important works on various syntactic phenomena within the frameworks of both phrase structure syntax and dependency syntax, including sentence length, probabilistic grammars and probabilistic parsing, Markov chains, Frumkina’s law on the syntactic level, distribution of dependency distance, and distribution of dependency types, and so on. These quantitative models, which have been empirically corroborated with real texts, or sometimes treebanks and dictionaries (of various languages), can be linguistically, cognitively, or functionally interpreted—a rare achievement in the past statistical investigations of language. Apart from the models concerning probabilistic grammars and Markov chains, which have already been widely used in computational linguistics, there are some other works that may also have practical applications in various fields. For example, the mathematical model of sentence length, which describes the probability of neighboring length classes as a function of the probability of the first of the two given classes, may contribute to practical applications such as text classification and the measurement of text comprehensibility, and so forth. The frequency studies of word and syntactic constructions have obtained many results useful for language teaching, the construction of parsing algorithms, and the estimation of effort of (automatic) rule learning, and more. The syntactic studies on Frumkina’s law, which is concerned with the number of text blocks with x occurrences of a given syntactic element or category, may benefit certain types of computational text processing if specific constructions or categories can be differentiated and found automatically by their particular distributions. One advantage of QL is that all its findings are mathematically formulated and linguistically interpreted, which at least makes it possible to be used in constructing models necessary for computational linguistics.In Chapter 4, Köhler introduces his efforts to build a real “linguistic theory,” for he believes that “there is not yet any elaborated linguistic theory in the sense of the philosophy of science” (page 21). Building such a theory begins with “plausible hypotheses,” which may become laws when sufficiently attested and may then be further integrated into a coherent system. This is the process of setting up a scientific theory, as succinctly summarized in the title of this chapter: “Hypotheses, Laws, and Theories.”The first section of this chapter shows the first step toward a scientific linguistic theory, the process in which “plausible hypotheses” are deduced, interpreted, and empirically attested before finally becoming laws. In Section 2, Köhler introduces the foundation of his synergetic linguistics, which views language as a dynamic, self-organizing, and self-regulating system where the so-called enslaving principle and order parameters are the crucial elements. On this basis, the author builds a synergetic syntactic model in Section 4.2.7 with certain modeling principles. Within the framework of phrase-structure syntax, eight properties of syntactic constructions and four inventories are chosen to build this model, which are linked together by laws resulting from the verified hypotheses and subject to the regulation of some order parameters.Quantitative linguistics, which is an unfamiliar field of study for many linguists, depends heavily on real texts and mathematical tools. Therefore we believe it is worthwhile to briefly clarify the differences and the relations between QL and corpus linguistics, on one hand, and between QL and computational linguistics, on the other hand. In comparison with QL, corpus linguistics is in fact more of a research methodology rather than an independent linguistic discipline, reflecting a shift of focus from competence to performance, from introspection to empirical study. This makes both the common ground and the difference between corpus linguistics and QL, which aims to quantitatively and mathematically explore, on the basis of real texts and treebanks, the fundamental laws governing the structure and evolution of language, and integrate them into a systematic theory capable of explanation and prediction.Computational linguistics (CL) is an interdisciplinary field investigating the structure of natural languages from a formal, mathematical, and computational point of view. Compared with QL, CL seems to be more interested in research that can have direct applications in such fields as language understanding, language generation, machine translation, and so forth, than in the explanation of language structure, operation, and evolution. Traditionally, the mathematical models used in CL are derived from the linguistic theories via the process of formalization. Due to the limitations of the qualitative mathematical models, however, the statistical models, most of which so far fail linguistic interpretations, have recently become dominant in the field of computational linguistics. That is perhaps why Shuly Wintner (2009, page 641), in a “Last Words” article in this journal, called for “the return of linguistics to computational linguistics,” implying that the advances in the field of CL may ultimately lie in the advances in the understanding of language itself.Wintner’s appeal does reflect the present situation of computational linguistics: a discipline in which many works are heavily oriented towards engineering and weakly grounded in linguistics. The formal linguistic models seem now outshone by the purely statistical paradigms, as the result of their inadequacy in processing real-world languages. Of course, this means no renouncement of the value of the traditional formal models. But it is obvious that considerable updating and enrichment are necessary for these formal models if they are to play significant roles in the future. In this regard, QL, which has a solid linguistic foundation, may help by providing quantitative cues (which are linguistically interpretable) to improve the performance in NLP, as has been illustrated in the case of probabilistic grammar that ingeniously integrates quantitative, statistical devices into qualitative linguistic models. QL has provided some useful models for CL. And it is reasonable to believe that it will continue to do so in the future, though some of its achievements seem now not ready to be directly used in CL.But perhaps QL can do more than that. Though QL has not yet drawn much attention from computational linguistics, it is potentially a proper answer to Wintner’s call for the return of linguistics to computational linguistics. CL aims to replicate in computers the patterns of human language behavior, whereas QL endeavors to mathematically and quantitatively reveal the laws and the principles that govern human language behavior—this is a relation between theory and practice. The success of a scientific discipline is usually based on precise models that are well-grounded in profound understanding of the object of study. Computational linguistics is no exception. Two features of QL are hence noteworthy. One is that it aims to explain, within a certain linguistic framework, the operation and the evolution of language by uncovering the systematic cognitive and functional regulations that underlie human languages. The other is that it tries to mathematically model, with systematic and precise quantitative laws, these regulations and the resulting mechanism of language. In view of these two features, we believe that the success of QL will somehow and somewhat boost the studies in the field of CL and that the communication between QL and CL is and will be not only possible but also mutually beneficial. This is why we hold that it is worthwhile to recommend this book to researchers in the field of computational linguistics, a book presenting a panorama of QL in general and discoveries on the syntactic level in particular.",1,0

"t is a commonplace these days to remark on the ways in which .the revolution in information technology has changed the ways that people get things done.John Simpson of the Oxford English Dictionary, addressing the 2001 DSNA conference in Ann Arbor, illustrated some of the many ways in which the Internet, and easily distributable texts on magnetic media, have revolutionized the practice of lexicography (Simpson [2002]). Today we all take for granted an important implication of these changes that was not especially pertinent to Mr. Simpson's remarks, but that figures importantly in the subject of this paper: access to English texts of every variety is no longer bound by ownership or location. Texts of every kind, including corpora stored on the Internet or on magnetic media, are now readily accessible and searchable by anyone who owns a computer — which today for all practical purposes means everyone. There has been a gradual migration from the publisher outwards of the important resources that go into making dictionaries. Everything that was once necessarily located in-house can now be decentralized and can reside anywhere, whether it be digital or human. What all this means is that nobody has to be in the office to do the work. Anyone with the requisite skills and equipment can practice what I will call long-distance lexicography: that is, practical lexicography remote from the premises of a dictionary publisher. The motive for any technological change in lexicography has generally and rightly been to improve the final product; that is, the",1,0

"Abstract This ethnographic research examines language socialization practices and language ideologies in secular Yiddish “metalinguistic communities,” communities of positioned social actors shaped by practices that view language as an object. “Metalinguistic community” is a framework for diverse participants who can experience both distance from and closeness to the language and its speakers, due to historical, personal, and/or communal circumstances. Through an examination of classroom interactions in California, this article shows how simultaneous distancing and closeness experienced by metalinguistic community members can manifest in “contested stance practices,” public demonstrations of language ideologies that reveal both internal and external tensions. Contested stance practices reveal how members’ perceptions of language are shaped by their personal histories and those of their imagined communities; these practices become a fertile means through which individuals negotiate their relationships with language as a symbol of identity, ideology, and community.",1,0

"Die meisten alten baltischen Entlehnungen des Ostseefinnischen sind mithilfe ostbaltischer Entsprechungen ihres Originals entdeckt worden. Vergleichsmaterial aus dem Slawischen ist jedoch viel relevanter als bisher gedacht. Dies wird durch die hier vorgetragenen 20 ostseefinnischen Baltismen bestätigt. Das Original von acht Fällen ist ausschließlich im Slawischen erhalten. In den übrigen 12 Fällen kann entweder die Bedeutung oder die Form des Originals ohne slawisches Material nicht rekonstruiert werden. Diese Lehnetymologien stützen damit den baltischen Ursprung des Urslawischen.Die verschwundene Mundart, aus der das Mittelurfinnische dieses Lehngut während des letzten vorchristlichen Jahrtausends erhielt, lag lautlich dem rekonstruierbaren Urbaltoslawischen nahe.",1,0

"Of the 6000 languages in the world, half have less than 10,000 speakers, and a quarter less than 1000. Accumulations of small languages have led to widespread bi- and multilingualism, with more than half of the world´s languages spoken by bi- and multilinguals. Many larger languages are used as contact languages. Many of such contact languages become simplified. Pidgin languages are different. They develop through attempts at basic intercommunication between speakers of different languages. They have a limited vocabulary, and a limited grammar. If a pidgin language is extensively used, it develops and becomes richer. It eventually becomes the first language of children as a creole language. Chabacano is a typical example. As a well functioning language spoken by many over a long time it is a full language. Small and minority languages tend to become endangered, largely through pressure from monolingual speakers of large dominant languages and adverse governmental language policies. About 1970, a widespread revival of ethnic identity feeling started among speakers of minority languages, and governments often changed their language policies to positive ones. Many people kept their own languages. Bi- and multilingualism has advantages over monolingualism in matters of applied intellect, and memory and learning capacities. More languages survive now.",1,0

"The present study had two purposes: (a) to replicate previous research on intrinsic and extrinsic motivation for language learning in French Canadian students of English, and (b) to consider the relations between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation and the integrative orientation. Québécois university students (N = 59) in a summer English immersion course completed a questionnaire addressing their reasons for language learning, perceptions of autonomy and competence, effort expended in language learning, determination to pursue English studies, and course achievement. The results of correlational analyses supported the predicted relations between theoretical antecedents and consequences of intrinsic and extrinsic orientations. The integrative orientation correlated most strongly with the intrinsic orientation. The results are discussed in terms of the implications of these orientations for language learning outcomes.",1,0
"NTIL THE MASS MIGRATION of largely rural southern blacks into the cities of the northern and western United States following the Great Depression and the Second World War, little systematic attention had been paid to the speech of American blacks. Exceptions are such rare studies as those by Harrison (1884), Farrison (1936), and Pardoe (1937). Turner (1945, 1948, 1949), it is true, had studied the Gullah dialect in some detail, and though his data are still extremely valuable to both American dialectologists and creolists, his influence at the time was limited (Walker 1968, p. 12) owing to the controversial nature of his thesis that the linguistic legacy from West Africa in this dialect was extensive and profound,' as well as to the fact that the rhetorical intent of his study was comparative rather than descriptive. Indeed, Gullah has long been rightly judged to be the most divergent dialect in the Atlantic states (Mencken 1948, p. 101), and Gullah speakers were in effect ignored as informants in the dialect surveys for the Linguistic Atlas (Atwood 1953, p. 41, fn. 15). Though many peculiarities of general American black English had long been recognized even by amateur students of the language (Mencken 1948, pp. 264-65), accurate systematic treatments prior to the 1960s were rare--an important exception being the studies of general southern black phonology by Wise (1933; 1957, pp. 293-302). The typical treatment by linguists was to deny racial or caste speech differences, and to correlate such peculiarities as were found with region and class. Thus, in this view (expressed explicitly by Krapp 1925, 1: 162), black dialect differed hardly at all from other varieties of lower-class, or uneducated, English of the same area (see also Greet 1934; Read 1939; Kurath 1949, p. 6). And in spite of burgeoning research in black English during the late 1960s and extending up to the present, this position, though somewhat modified now, is still not a completely unpopular one for linguists to take. It is defended by McDavid (1967b, 1971), Farrison (1969), and Davis (1969). A more extreme position was formerly held even by linguists: that of dismissing from serious linguistic consideration whatever peculiarities were found, on the basis that they were the product, somehow, of arrested language",1,0
"Abstract Recent findings indicate that bilingualism delay the onset of dementia. Using data from the Betula longitudinal cohort study on memory, health and aging ( www.betula.su.se ) the issue of a possible protective effect of bilingualism was addressed. Monolingual ( n = 736) and bilingual ( n = 82) participants (≥ 60 years) without dementia at inclusion were followed for incident dementia over a time-period up to 10 years. In total, 112 participants developed dementia. Analyses were performed with Cox proportional hazards regression adjusted for age, sex, and presence/absence of the Apolipoprotein E (APOE) ɛ4 allele, with dementia outcome as the dependent variable. Results showed no delayed onset of dementia in bilinguals compared to monolinguals. However, because of the findings from a study using participants from the same population showing beneficial longitudinal effects of bilingualism on episodic memory; we argue that our results may depend on the frequency of use of the second language after retirement.",1,0

"In this paper, I draw on the ethnography of language planning and policy to consider how urban Indigenous language education might benefit from understanding the meanings and processes behind other language planning and policy activities migrant youth participate in, specifically, family language policymaking activities. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork and interviews conducted in the region of Cusco, Perú I examine the experiences of two youth from rural hometowns and of their families. My analysis discusses how family language policies influenced youth’s shifting repertoires towards and away from Quechua, how youth drew on their Quechua–Spanish bilingualism to act as family language policy agents guided by local crianza and raciolinguistic ideologies, and how youth experienced Quechua language education in urban high schools. I argue that urban Quechua education efforts need to consider how migrant youth experience and shape their bilingualism and that of their families across rural-urban continua in order to craft safe and meaningful spaces where youth can participate in the strengthening of their Quechua language practices and identities.",1,0

"This article deals with how export oriented Austrian companies effect code choice in their business relationships with customers from Romance language speaking countries. The focus lies on the most widespread Romance languages, therefore on French, Spanish, Italian and Portuguese speaking customers. The question of code choice in export should be raised at different levels: an economic macro-, an industry-related and corporate meso- and an individual micro-level. The latter stands for the interaction between dispositional, motivational and situational factors that can be found in the context of business relationships. This article tries to describe these levels as well as to show their close interdependence within an integrated model. The model is illustrated by three case studies of export oriented Austrian companies from three different sectors of industry. In this way, we aim to show how the different factors of code choice interact and intertwine to create always new and different, but ration...",1,0

"Abstract This paper presents a model of phonotactic grammar in which wellformedness of consonant clusters is measured by NAD. NAD stands for a Net Auditory Distance obtaining between segments in a cluster. The auditory distance is a net reflection of the differences between segments in terms of manner (MOA) and place of articulation (POA). It is calculated according to the Principle which states that a cluster is preferred if it satisfies a pattern of distances specified by the universal phonotactic preference relevant for its position in a word. Every position of a cluster in a word, i.e. initial, medial and final, is defined by a respective well-formedness (“goodness of cluster”) preference. The NAD Principle makes finer predictions than the sonority sequencing generalization (SSG). For example, it predicts that initial pr- is “better” (more preferred) that tr-, and they are both better than ps- or rt-, while the latter two are of comparable value. However, phonology alone does not fully account for clusters. Inflection, word-formation and compounding contribute to the creation of consonant clusters to an extent relative to a morphological type of a language. Therefore, a phonotactic grammar operates on basic, non-derived, lexical forms, while morphonotactics takes care of the remaining, morphologically complex, forms. Interaction between phonotactics and morphonotactics provides a richer insight into the understanding of cluster complexity.",1,0
"The notion of informedness plays a significant role in several modern healthcare models, and many studies argue that informed patients accomplish better health outcomes. Drawing on audio-visual recordings of general practice consultations in Denmark, this paper uses conversation analysis to examine cases where doctors elaborate diagnoses with anatomy explanations; that is, where they provide patients with details about the structure of internal body parts and biological processes in order for patients to fully comprehend their diagnosis and its implications for treatment options. The study focuses on two cases, one involving explaining to a patient the ligaments in the knee and other the lymph nodes in the upper tract region. The analysis shows how the doctors manage to compensate for patients’ lack of visual access to these regions by integrating the explanations with a series of haptic touches and depictive gestures. I conclude by suggesting that anatomy explanations are discussed as measures not only to adhere to modern healthcare ideals that forefront the need to inform patients, but also to accomplish significant local actions such as to assure patients and have them appreciate a wait-and-see treatment plan.",1,0

"INFORMATION technology has had a profound impact on many aspects of life over the last twenty-odd years. One linguistic area where computers have made important inroads is the compiling of dictionaries. Until the 1980s, such works were still put together, more or less, along the same paper-and-ink lines as when Dr Johnson was at work in the 18th century, although methods of work and levels of reliability had improved. In the last two decades, however, there have been numerous IT-led developments, revolutions and evolutions in lexicography, mostly to the benefit of dictionary users, though some more recent developments are perhaps debatable.

"Vroee woordeboeke is gekenmerk deur ’n tematiese ordening. Dit is eers later in die leksikografiese praktyk dat die alfabetiese ordening ’n dominante rol begin speel het, alhoewel die tematiese benadering steeds in bepaalde woordeboeksoorte gehandhaaf is. Die hedendaagse leksikografiese praktyk toon ’n nuwe benadering tot makrostrukturele ordening met ’n hibridiese aanbod van opeenvolgende makrostrukture waarin sowel die alfabetiese as die tematiese beginsels ’n ordeningsrol speel. Hierdie artikel gee aandag aan die ontwikkeling van die leksikografiese praktyk en die motivering vir ’n tematiese ordening in die vroee woordeboeke. Voorts word die oorgang na ’n oorwegend alfabetiese ordening beskryf. Ontwikkeling in die teoretiese leksikografie en die wisselwerking tussen teorie en praktyk lei tot verskillende aanpassings in die makrostrukturele aanbod. Naas die streng alfabetiese ordening is daar tans ook die kronkelordening waar ’n horisontale ordening van lemmata tot artikelniste en artikelneste lei. Hierdie ordening kom veral in gedrukte woordeboeke voor. Morfologiese en semantiese redes speel ’n rol in die aanpassings van die makrostrukturele ordening. Benewens suiwer alfabetiese en suiwer tematiese woordeboeke is daar vandag talle woordeboeke met ’n hibridiese ordening. In die makrostruktuurreeks van ’n enkele woordeboek is sommige tekste alfabeties en ander tematies georden. Hierdie aanpassings word nie lukraak gedoen nie, maar wel ter erkenning van die gebruikersperspektief wat ŉ dominante rol in die leksikografiepraktyk speel.

"This article reexamines a controversial construction in Acehnese (Lawler 1977 versus Durie 1988). I demonstrate that the construction is a passive, even though a verbal prefix bears the features of the agent rather than the surface subject. I analyze the prefix as a morphological realization of the functional head that introduces the external argument; the features borne by this head are not agreement, but rather interpretable features that restrict the external argument position. Important consequences are that Acehnese does not counterexemplify the universality of grammatical relations (contra Durie 1988 and subsequent), and that Acehnese provides clear morphological evidence for the presence in passives of the functional head that introduces the external argument.*",1,0

"Abstract In the linguistics literature, the derivation of scalar implicatures has often been handled in a relatively modular way, using computations that are sensitive to logical relations among alternatives such as entailment but are blind to other notions such as the probabilities that participants in a conversation might associate with these alternatives (or with related propositions). In recent years, a family of models that we refer to as iterated rationality models (IRMs) have offered an interestingly different perspective on such alternative-sensitive processes in terms of multiple iterations of (typically probabilistic) reasoning. Our paper investigates what at first sight seems like a very interesting argument for the adequacy of IRMs as models of scalar implicatures, coming from the conjunctive interpretation of disjunctive sentences. We then outline challenges for the argument based on a theoretical comparison with the grammatical theory of scalar implicatures. The comparison focuses on the full distribution of conjunctive interpretation, on the question of sensitivity to priors, and on other results achieved within the grammatical theory that the IRM literature has yet to engage with.",1,0

"The lexicographical record of English in Canada began with wordlists of the late eighteenth, nineteenth, and early twentieth centuries. From the beginning of the twentieth century onwards, the general vocabulary of English in Canada has been represented in bilingual and monolingual dictionaries, often adapted from American or British dictionaries. In the 1950s, several important projects were initiated, resulting in the publication of general dictionaries of English in Canada, and of dictionaries of Canadianisms and of the vocabulary of particular regions of Can-ada. This article gives an overview of these dictionaries and of their reception, contextualizing them in the larger picture of the lexicography of Canada's other official language, French, and of a number of its non-official languages. It concludes by looking at the future of English-language lexicography in Canada, and by observing that although it has, at its best, reached a high degree of sophistication, there are still major opportunities waiting to be taken. keywords: dictionary, lexicography, canadian english, canadianisms, national dictionaries, canadian french, canadian first nations lan-guages, bilingual dictionaries, regional dictionaries, unfinished diction-ary projects",1,0

"Editorial Edward Finegan This issue of Dictionaries opens with the third installment of Michael Adams’s history of the Dictionary Society of North America, the journal’s publisher. Relying on abundant archival material, the story Adams tells constitutes “a chapter in the history of the language sciences,” he says, and the first three installments of the story do that and more. They tell the story of a group who, from the start, aimed to create a community of men and women interested in sharing their interest in and knowledge of dictionaries and in creating forums for propagating that knowledge. Part I dealt principally with DSNA’s founding circumstances and Part II with its founding leaders. Part III focuses on DSNA membership patterns and on members themselves during the early years, 1977 to 1989. As an example, Adams describes correspondence between Ed Gates, DSNA’s founder, and New York Times columnist William Safire. Safire had provided readers of his “On Language” column a broad description of DSNA, with its benefits and low membership fee, and the society’s rolls exploded, testing its office capacity and prompting consternation among support staff charged with meeting the expectations of the new “Safire members.” Other unexpected and sometimes delightful reports appear in this installment, and one’s appetite for the final installment is whetted. Elizabeth Knowles relies on archival and other material to focus her examination of the wartime backdrop to the initial publication of The Oxford Book of Quotations. The first edition of ODQ appeared in the fall of 1941 in British and American versions, identical but for their introductions, the American Carl van Doren writing one for North American readers, the Englishman Bernard Darwin another for British readers. The contents of ODQ were compiled before the outbreak of World War [End Page vii] II, and Knowles addresses the challenge Oxford University Press faced in offering a book of quotations devoid of obvious reference to wartime in Britain and impending war in the US. She describes the “ingenious” way in which Darwin played on tropes familiar to those following Churchill and Roosevelt and their citation of poems to give the volume a sense of timeliness. As a chapter on the history of publishing and on the complex interplay between a reference book, its times, and the imagined expectations of its audiences, “One Dictionary, Two Introductions” touches not only on the exigencies of wartime publishing such as paper rationing but also on the balancing act required of publishers seeking contributions from distinguished, if overly busy, contributors. Stephen Turton likewise addresses the relevance of cultural and social circumstances to reference works, in particular to hard-word and general dictionaries of the early modern period. “Unlawful Entries” is a richly ambiguous title for Turton’s discussion of dictionary treatments of buggery and sodomy in the 150 years preceding publication of Dr. Johnson’s dictionary in 1755. Despite the incoherence that Turton finds in definitions of those two and related words in early modern English dictionaries, he concludes that “the silences and paradoxes embedded in these early definitions allow them to be read from perspectives that are more radical than their writers likely intended.” One perspective through which Turton’s discussion of entries on buggery and sodomy might be viewed relates to the difference between words and things. It is just that difference between a dictionary entry and an encyclopedia article that Michael Hancher explores in “Dictionary vs. Encyclopedia.” Hancher begins his analysis before the OED and focuses on Trench, Murray, and Gove among subsequent lexicographers, while also discussing philosophers of language, including Paul Grice. Balancing a dictionary entry’s defining a word and its describing the thing the word names has been a perennial challenge for lexicographers and, despite commitments particularly to definitions of the word as opposed to description of the thing, honoring the commitment has proven challenging, if not impossible, in practice. Observers have long noted the challenge, and Hancher cites Allen Walker Read’s observation that “it is difficult to construct a dictionary without considerable attention to the objects and abstractions designated.” Quite different in focus from the other four articles in this issue, Caroline Myrick argues for “The Value of Local Dictionaries in...",1,0

"The present study examined continuity/discontinuity and stability/instability of noun and verb production measures in 30 child-mother dyads observed at 16 and 20 months, and predictive relations with the acquisition of nouns and verbs at 24 months. Children exhibited significant discontinuity and robust stability in the frequency of nouns and verbs between 16 and 20 months (over and above the contribution of maternal measures). By contrast, mothers showed small, but significant, increases in the total number of nouns and the percentages of nouns located in the initial and final utterance positions, together with a decrease in the percentage of verbs located in the initial position. After removing the variance explained by child language, mothers' speech was stable only in the percentages of nouns located in the initial and final utterance positions. Finally, children's production of nouns at 24 months was predicted by the percentages of nouns located in the initial and final positions of maternal utterances at 16 months. Maternal measures at 20 months did not predict children's production of nouns nor for verbs at 24 months. Implications for language acquisition are discussed.",1,0

La desautomatización puede ser exclusivamente semántica, debido fundamentalmente a la intertextualidad, es decir, al cambio de significado que se genera cuando la forma canónica, procedente de otros discursos (sobre todo el cinematográfico y televisivo, el publicitario, el musical, el militar, el religioso, el político y el histórico), se inserta en la portada de un diario deportivo.

"Abstract Postural instability is a cardinal indicator of concussion. Assessments of the postural control system range from clinical to laboratory tests that assess the balance of the individual. In a previous article regarding clinical assessment of balance in adults with concussion, we reviewed the importance of balance as a component in concussion evaluations. The purpose of this review article is to update the information previously published in 2014. Since 2014, research has provided evidence for the incorporation of dynamic methods for evaluating balance postconcussion with particular emphasis on sensory system integration and dual tasking. Therefore, this review will examine the current state of knowledge on how concussion injuries affect postural control, advancements in evaluating balance postconcussion, such as novel eye-tracking techniques, and current recommendations for best practices for balance assessment.",1,0

"In most rural and township English additional language classrooms, everyday language discursive practices of bi/multilingual students are underutilised. This study reports on how grade 4 emergent isiZulu-English bilingual children used their everyday language resources as a tool for epistemic access. Drawing on translanguaging, this paper aims to support recent research that challenges monolingual and monoglossic language practices, which tend to limit children’s learning and complex identities. Data were collected from classroom observational notes, video recordings, and interviews with the teacher, the learners, and the principal. Findings show that, despite classroom practices that constrained children’s learning, children who recruited diverse linguistic resources created a space to engage in meaningful learning and represent their multiple identities beyond the stereotypical ones. I conclude the paper by calling for pedagogical practices that support inclusion of learners’ everyday language discursive practices in order to enhance effective learning and support learners’ multiple identities.",1,0

"Abstract Objective To achieve a unified and plausible concept of the aetiology of psychosis. Background From an evolutionary point of view, the capacity for language evolved relatively abruptly 150,000–200,000 years ago as a result of a saltational genetic change that allowed the two hemispheres to develop with a degree of independence. According to Crow (1997) the predisposition to schizophrenia might be a component of Homo sapiens-specific variation associated with the capacity for language. Crow (2000) suggested that schizophrenia is “the price that Homo sapiens pays for language”. Language impairment is one of the, core phenomenological characteristics of patients with schizophrenia ( DeLisi, 2001 ). These symptoms might be understood as a breakdown of bi-hemispheric coordination of language. After reviewing the literature and regarding our own data concerning subcortical ambiguity processing, we suggest that subcortical language processing might play a crucial role as a missing link between the evolution of language (genetics), hemispheric dysbalance and language disorder in schizophrenia. Concentrating on the long time underestimated subcortical role of high order language function might open new perspectives in understanding the aetiology of psychosis. Conclusion From our point of view there might be at least two pathways useful in forming a neurolinguistic approach to understand language symptoms in schizophrenia: first, hemispheric imbalance might play a crucial role in the development of schizophrenia. The second pathway leads to a potentially disturbed interdependency between fronto-temporo-parietal and subcortical neural networks and their importance in the processing of high order linguistic functions (such as decoding ambiguities).",1,0
"Internet est devenu au fil des ans, le pilier central autour duquel se construit la societe dite de l’information. Sa place preponderante dans l’edifice des technologies de l’information et de la communication (TIC) tient a certains facteurs convergents : accessibilite aisee et peu couteuse a une information de plus en plus importante (7 millions de pages nouvelles apparaissent chaque jour sur le Net), integration des technologies autrefois isolees (ecrit, image fixe, video, communication bidirectionnelle, interactivite…), presence de services de plus en plus attractifs (location de DVD en ligne, video a la demande, videoconference, reservation et achat a distance…).

"Choctaw Indians, a branch of the Muscogees, have resided in varying numbers in a major portion of East Central Mississippi since their migration into the area from the South or West at some undetermined point in the past. There are primarily two Choctaw migration myths. According to one widespread tradition, the Choctaws originated in a land far to the West. An eastward trek was begun, headed by a leader named Chata who carried a sacred pole, described (depending on the source) as a leaning pole, sacred pole, red stick, staff, golden rod, or bent staff. Every evening this miraculous pole was placed in the ground at the enc~mpment site. Each sunrise found the pole leaning toward the East as the signal for the journey to continue. After many months of wandering, Chata and his followers reached a point in Southeastern Winston County, Mississippi, where, as they placed the sacred pole in the ground and made camp for the night, a heavy rain fell. The next morning the pole was standing in an upright position, and Chata announced that the long-sought land of Nanih Waiya (sloping hill) had been found. The people began building mounds and ramparts and made Nanih Waiya the ceremonial center of the Choctaw nation. Within this legend is also couched an explanation of the appearance of a sister tribe, the Chickasaws. The two tribes were originally one, but during the eastward migration they became separated, one group being led by Chikasah and the other by Chata. These two men were brothers and became the leaders of their respective tribes. I A second migration myth was related by Peter P. Pitchlynn, a Choctaw statesman of the mid-1800's. His version includes the leaning pole and the Nanih Waiya experience, but instead of moving from the West, the",1,0

"A common assumption is that children learn a language implicitly and without conscious awareness of form and grammar, but this assumption has virtually never been tested experimentally. We propose a novel experimental method to examine if children’s ability to acquire linguistic regularities relates to awareness of these regularities. Traditional methods investigating awareness often rely on learners’ abilities to verbalize their awareness. For young children, such methods are not adequate because they often cannot reflect explicitly on their acquired knowledge, although they might be aware of it in a way they cannot verbalize. To test this, we adapted a method that is used to investigate awareness in animals, because it does not rely on verbalization for demonstrating awareness. Pilot results with 26 adults and 48 kindergartners show some important procedural prerequisites are met. In future research, this procedure could be used to investigate the development of meta-linguistic awareness in children.",1,0

"This paper analyses how health-related media content is produced by the editorial board of an infotainment TV show on food. Health-related news and other media content is on the rise, and impacts laypeople’s health knowledge, their behaviour, the public agenda and governmental policy. At the same time, it is criticized for being inaccurate, badly framed and sensationalist. This is generally attributed to the difficulty of linearly ‘translating’ scientific findings into journalistic findings, which results in the collision between scientific and journalistic perspectives and practices. This paper questions the idea that producing health-related media content is just linear translation, and looks into how two current societal trends, the rise of healthism and soft news, shape the production process. Drawing on linguistic ethnographic data from fieldwork at the editorial board of the show, two case studies are analysed qualitatively and in-depth to gain deeper insight in the complex dynamics of producing health-related media content. The data show that producing health-related media-content indeed is not a matter of translating biomedical science to a journalistic perspective, but of intense coproduction of journalistic and scientific practices, and nowadays as well as of coproduction with new, non-scientific pseudo-experts and pseudo-scientific practices.",1,0
"The History of Gailaudet University: 150 Years of a Deaf American Institution, by David F Armstrong (Washington, DC: Gailaudet University Press, 2014, 212 pp., hardcover, $75, ISBN 978-1-56368-595-8)One of the last things I said to my best friend of forty-four years, Robert F Panara, on the day before he passed away last summer, was that T. Alan Hurwitz, Gailaudet University president, and his wife,Vicki, had left him a copy of The History of Gailaudet University that morning. They had stopped by to see him, but he was sleeping, and they did not wish to disturb his rest. Having glanced through the excellent work by David F. Armstrong, I told Bob that the book mentioned that William C. Stokoe had described the beauty of Bob's signs, which Bill had observed numerous times while doing research on American Sign Language. I also told Bob that the book had a fullpage summary of the story of his lipreading Queen Elizabeth during an American football game. Bob always enjoyed telling that story, and he would have loved Armstrong's summary of the 150-year history of Gailaudet. With more than 350 photographs (so ably chosen with Gailaudet archivist Michael J. Olson's assistance) and many anecdotes, the book is one that all alumni and friends of Gailaudet University should have.Many times in the past four decades I have walked on the paths of the beautiful campus, partly designed by American landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted, and as a lover of history I am often struck by the beauty of the mix of old and new buildings, groves of trees and open fields, and especially the preservation of historic structures such as College Hall, Chapel Hall, Ole Jim, the Gate House, and the Faculty Row houses, still in use. Walking across Kendall Green, one is reminded of the rich history of this institution, the collegiate program chartered by President Abraham Lincoln in the midst of a national crisis, the Civil War. And it was not long after the inauguration that the deaf students and their professors watched from their high vantage point as train after train brought soldiers home when the war ended. In contrast, modern structures on campus were created with visually accessible space for people who communicate in sign language in mind.But the buildings and the campus are only a small part of Gallaudet University's history, as Armstrong so well illustrates in this beautifully designed book. The History of Gallaudet University strikes a nice balance among its various sections, which include academic history, campus life, athletics, theatrical productions, successful graduates, and other topics. Photographs such as the one of Sophia Fowler Gallaudet have rarely appeared in other publications, and athletic photographs such as the one of the Five Iron Men basketball team make this book all the more a conversation piece. Student traditions such as the rat funeral and the hare and hounds chase will be fun to read about for those who have attended the university, bringing back memories of their own days on Kendall Green.Academically, the book walks the reader through 150 years of history, beginning with the establishment of the Columbia Institution for the Instruction of the Deaf and Dumb and the Blind, as well as the chartering of the collegiate program to grant higher education degrees to young deaf people. Then it progresses through different administrations, from Edward Miner Gallaudet's pioneering work to the most recent leadership by T. Alan Hurwitz. Importantly, the book does not hide controversial aspects of the presidential legacies. Instead, it presents interesting discussions about the delay in admitting both deaf African American students and female students during the Gallaudet years, the anger of deaf professor Frederick Hughes when he was removed as instructor of a drama course during the accreditation process, and the reason that I. King Jordan changed his mind during the Deaf President Now! …",1,0

After presenting an overview of his life and his English Dictionary, it shows the respects in which Coles’s lexicographical work was innovative; it asks why his dictionary was so small, suggesting that this was a competitive publishing strategy, designed in particular to ensure that the English Dictionary took over the section of the market which had previously been shared by revised editions of the dictionary of Cockeram; it argues for Coles’s liveliness as a reader and thinker; and it gives an account of the pedagogical context of his dictionary.",1,0

"Coreferentialism refers to the common assumption in the literature that slurs (e.g. faggot) and descriptors (e.g. male homosexual) are coreferential expressions with precisely the same extension. For instance, Vallee (2014) recently writes that “If S is an ethnic slur in language L, then there is a non-derogatory expression G in L such that G and S have the same extension” (p. 79). The non-derogatory expression G is commonly considered the nonpejorative correlate (NPC) of the slur expression S (Hom, 2008) and it is widely thought that every S has a coreferring G that possesses precisely the same extension. Yet here I argue against this widespread assumption by first briefly introducing what slurs are and then considering four sources of supporting evidence showing that slurs and descriptors are in fact not coreferential expressions with precisely the same extension. I argue that since slurs and descriptors differ in their extension they thereby differ in their meaning or content also. This article additionally introduces the notion of a conceptual anchor in order to adequately account for the relationship between slurs and descriptors actually evidenced in the empirical data, and further considers the inadequacy of common dictionary definitions of slurs. This article therefore contributes to the literature on slurs by demonstrating that previous accounts operating on the assumption that slurs and descriptors are coreferential expressions with the same extension, and that they thereby have the same meaning or content, are inconsistent with empirical data and that an alternative account in accord with Croom (2011, 2013a, 2014b) better fits the facts concerning their actual meaning and use.",1,0

"^RA JONES married Ora Jones,' a statement of 'Believe it or Not' t/ Ripley, exemplifies the amusing and often puzzling practice of giving the same Christian names to men and women. I remember learning, as a child, a set of mnemonics for the vowels which included Ora as a girl's name, and I recall my surprise when I read later of the doings of one Ora Morningstar, a male billiard player. And I was confused when I first read about Alma Richards, an Olympic highjump star. The list that follows is composed of names which have been employed both as male and as female given names. (The abbreviation f. is used for female and m. for male.) In some cases, the double use is of my own knowledge (e.g., a man of my acquaintance insists that his name is 'Ruby,' and never writes it any other way; he has support in the name of the former governor of Kentucky, Ruby Laffoon); some I have been told of by others; but most have been culled from my recent reading. In the latter case I have accepted a name in a use which I found novel and unaccustomed only if the context or setting, such as a picture or a personal pronoun, showed the sex without question. I have ignored such pairs as Francis and Frances; my whole point is the application of precisely the same name to both sexes. I have been wary of, and have sought to exclude, nicknames and diminutives; but the related phenomenon of applying to women diminutives ordinarily regarded as male is considered later. Middle names, such as that of Erich Maria Remarque, have not been included; the names of female saints are often given as middle names to boys in Catholic countries. Pen names, such as Henry Handel Richardson and George Eliot (are there any instances of men using women's names as pen names?) are, of course, irrelevant.",1,0

"In the last few decades, Information and Communications Technology (ICT) applications have been shaping the field of Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL). Mobile Assisted Language Learning (MALL) paved the way for ubiquitous learning. The advent of new technologies in the early 21st century also added a social dimension to ICT that allowed for Networked Learning (NL). Given that language learning is fundamentally a socio-cultural experience, networked learning capabilities have provided the potential for language learning in community settings. This has revitalized the earlier frameworks provided by CALL. NL has empowered language learners today to connect globally, to access Open Educational Resources, and to self-regulate their learning processes beyond the scope of traditional curricula. In parallel, the rising pervasiveness of Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications and their relevance to language learning has led CALL to branch out into Intelligent CALL (ICALL). The first section of this article provides a brief historical overview of CALL, examines it through the lens of ICT, networked learning, and open access. The second section focuses on the implications of AI for creating new trends in second language education, the challenge for providing customization at scale, and raises important issues related to transparency and privacy for future research.",1,0

"This article discusses aspects of an on-going lexical computing project at the University of Zimbabwe, known as ALLEX, the acronym for African Languages Lexical Project. ALLEX is a collaborative, multi-faceted, long-term, computer-aided lexicography project that is intended to produce a series of dictionaries, glossaries and other language reference works in the indigenous languages of Zimbabwe, starting with the first ever monolingual Shona dictionary, which is already at an advanced stage of preparation, and which will also be the first corpus-based dictionary in Zimbabwe. The article confines itself to problems relating to word formation processes in Shona, specifically with reference to the lexicographers' need to ensure consistency in (i) identifying word forms as headwords in the running texts of the corpus, (ii) selecting from among these headwords to decide which ones to enter in the dictionary, and (iii) presenting the entries in the standard orthography. First, an outline is given of the project's background, objectives, priorities, guidelines and work in progress. The article then focuses on specific problems encountered, and discusses these, and some of the solutions, in the light of advances in computer lexicography, with particular reference to concordancing. It will become evident that the problems encountered by the ALLEX Team have to do with the unlimited capacity of the Shona language's basic and derivational word formation processes, which it shares with the other languages in the Bantu family. Therefore, it will be suggested that these problems, and the solutions that are being worked out, have much wider implications that go beyond Shona and Zimbabwe.",1,0

"At first sight, technology is transforming rapidly the workflow in translation. Like in many other fields, digital technology impacts translators’ daily life. Technology is so omnipresent that we are hardly capable of measuring the consequences it had, the metamorphosis it has induced. On the other hand, we are also so fascinated by all the technical devices and platforms we can use that we tend to forget or undermine the past and how technology and media have always played a role in the evolution of our cultures. Looking back in history, we can realise that some current practices in translation, considered as new, are not really so new.The use of multimodal “texts” we are referring to everyday is not without analogy with the production and the reading of “texts” in the past. Perhaps the transition from a logocentric to an intersemiotic and intermedial culture puts an end to a limited period of time in history, dominated by printing. But closing the “Gutenberg parenthesis” does not imply coming across the same artefacts again as before the 15th century.Based on the existing literature, our paper questions the borders between some translation practice, media, disciplines, through an historical perspective.",1,0

Is such an opportunity appropriate for allophone students who are still in the process of learning English? This literature review provides a fourfold consideration of the issue. Section 1 examines the political response by investigating whether Canadian federal policies provide for the inclusion of allophone students in FSL programs. Section 2 provides an overview of provincial policies, specifically examining allophone students’ access to FSL. A review of the literature regarding the motivation of allophone students is found in Section 3. Finally, Section 4 details the research on the achievement of allophone students studying French.",1,0

"It is vital to authenticate the content of speech signals to prevent the framing of innocent individuals. Furthermore, lack of speech content authentication may lead to repudiation. The research problem of authenticity vs falsehood is timely considering the recent worldwide interest in fake news and viral manipulated media. Liu & Wang proposed an algorithm to detect tamperings in speech content, based on semi-fragile watermarking. These techniques embed a watermark imperceptibly in the speech signal. Semantic changes to the speech will destroy the watermark, while signal processing operations will not affect the watermark. One main criterion for these speech content authentication schemes is the ability to withstand tampering attacks. We present a cryptanalysis attack framework for watermark based media authentication schemes. To exemplify this, two media authentication schemes and corresponding attacks are modelled within this framework. We discuss the main reasons leading to the attacks and propose a strategy to strengthen the Liu & Wang algorithm against such attacks. Security of speech authentication against tampering attacks.

"ESSEM allowed unsupervised model adaptation with only one testing utterance.ATG mapping function enhances ESSEM framework with sufficient adaptation statistics.Adaptation performance determined by appropriate selection of ensemble models.Over-fitting issues handled with optimization processes: MAP, MS, and CS.Imposing constraints on ATG allows flexible extension to LR, BC, LCB, LC, and BF. The ensemble speaker and speaking environment modeling (ESSEM) framework was designed to provide online optimization for enhancing workable systems under real-world conditions. In the ESSEM framework, ensemble models are built in the offline phase to characterize specific environments based on local statistics prepared from those particular conditions. In the online phase, a mapping function is computed based on the incoming testing data to perform model adaptation. Previous studies utilized linear combination (LC) and linear combination with a correction bias (LCB) as simple mapping functions that only apply one weighting coefficient on each model. In order to better utilize the ensemble models, this study presents a generalized affine transform group (ATG) mapping function for the ESSEM framework. Although ATG characterizes unknown testing conditions more precisely using a larger amount of parameters, over-fitting issues occur when the available adaptation data is especially limited. This study handles over-fitting issues with three optimization processes: maximum a posteriori (MAP) criterion, model selection (MS), and cohort selection (CS). Experimental results showed that ATG along with the three optimization processes enabled the ESSEM framework to allow unsupervised model adaptation using only one utterance to provide consistent performance improvements.",1,0

"Abstract Beyond labeling it easier to process than other types, few researchers who use technical text in their work try to define what it is. This paper describes a study that investigates the character of texts typically considered technical. We identify 42 features of a text considered likely to correlate with its degree of technicality. These include both objectively verifiable measures like marked presence of interrogative or imperative sentences which are akin to the criteria used by Biber in Variation Across Speech and Writing , and subjective measures such as presence of hierarchical organization . All are less ambiguous than technicality, so our inventory may be suited to use in a procedure that classifies text as technical or non-technical. An inventory organizing and describing these lexical, syntactic, semantic and discourse features was used to rate nine varied sample texts. Analysis of 22 ratings of each text indicated that 31 features in the inventory were meaningful predictors of text technicality when considered independently. The inventory has been revised and a formula to compute technicality has been developed in the light of these findings.",1,0

"Les discours d'exposition de la science ont fait l'objet, et ce depuis longtemps, d'une multitude d'analyses l. Il serait aventureux de pretendre les resumer en quelques lignes.

De nombreuses recherches ont permis de souligner les differences importantes entre ces vocabulaires restreints ou specialises et le lexique general, certains auteurs n'hesitant pas a parler de « langue scientifique et technique » (Kocourek, 1982). Pourtant, depuis une dizaine d'annees, une serie de recherches langagieres a permis de faire emerger une approche originale et beaucoup plus nuancee des phenomenes de socio-diffusion de la science ; elles ont conduit a remettre en cause les classifications reductrices opposant sommairement vulgarisation et discours legitimes d'exposition de la science (Jacobi, 1986, p. 23 et 38) ; etablissant que les vocabulaires scientifiques specialises ont un fonctionnement « plus diversifie, plus complexe et plus souple » (Mortureux, 19886, p. 105) que ne le laissait penser l'ideeal de biunivocite si souvent mis en avant pour distinguer le registre savant de la langue commune, elles ont degage les mecanismes textuels que le scripteur met en œuvre dans la perspective de contribuer a un hypothetique partage du savoir.

"Bibliometric methods may be used to study the impact of a field, the impact of certain trends and researchers within that field, and of course the impact of particular research articles. This is no different for the field of lexicography, and the output of both metalexicographers and dictionary makers alike is increasingly being measured and quantified. Analysing such data enables one (a) to track the growing and waning popularity of certain lexicographic sub-fields, (b) to pinpoint the new directions heralded by specific lexicographic papers or by new types of dictionaries, and (c) to map the lexicographic schools of thought that have formed around some of the pioneering or most productive scholars. In this article, bibliometrics in lexicography are investigated by taking the International Journal of Lexicography as the centre piece. In the first half of the article, various bibliometric tools relevant to lexicography are introduced, and in the second half these tools are used to show that lexicography has truly become an independent discipline. In the process, comparisons are also made with two other lexicographic journals (Dictionaries and Lexikos), as well as with two journals from other disciplines (Linguistics and Applied Linguistics)",1,0

"The year 1660 not only meant the return of the English monarchy, but it also signalled the return of parties and feasts, of drinking and eating in excess after eleven years of Puritanical abstinence. Both the tavern and the banquet halls were prominent spaces of homosocial male sociability at the time, intended for male bonding, sex talk and discussion of sexual prowess, three essential stages in the manhood-acquiring process. This paper argues that Etherege and Wycherley, two of the most prominent Restoration playwrights, not only present us with instances of banqueting and drinking in their plays, but also that their representations of drinking subvert the manhood-affirming nature of alcohol and drinking, thus questioning and subverting established gender roles.

"Reconstruction studies of Old Chinese (OC hereafter) and Proto Sino-Tibetan (PST hereafter) have yielded numerous significant discoveries related to the phonological histories of these two ancient languages. Despite recent advancements into OC and PST phonological histories, a few mysteries remain yet unsolved. One such mystery, the ‘stop coda’ problem, is as hotly debated now as it was when it was first raised seventy years ago. This long-running debate focuses on the existence and identity of the ‘stop codas’ in OC and in its parent language, PST. One reason why this debate has failed to reach a satisfactory conclusion is that the reconstruction methodology is limited, which assumes the Neogrammarian law of sound change. This law holds that sound change occurs without exception in every form that meets the structural description. Although this law applies to many sound changes in myriad world languages, it is not the only possible pathway of sound change. In this paper, I will argue that the key to the ‘stop-coda’ problem of OC belongs to another sound change type — lexical diffusion. The organization of the paper is as follows. In Part One, I will introduce the background of the debate over the ‘stop codas’ in OC. Part Two reviews previous opposing analyses of the ‘stop coda’ debate. Part Three details my proposal for a lexical diffusion analysis of the ‘stop coda’ problem based on internal evidence in Chinese. Part Four investigates the problem using the Comparative Method based on external evidence from Tibetan and loan words from Chinese to Sino-Japanese. In Part Five, I will present my solution to the ‘stop coda’ problem, which is based on the analysis in the two preceding sections. Finally, in Part Six, I will discuss the general methodology of phonological reconstruction in light of the sound change mechanism.",1,0

"Causatives have received considerable attention in first language acquisition. Of Mayan languages, acquisition of the causative has only been investigated for K’iche’ and Tzotzil, based on longitudinal and spontaneous data. K’iche’-speaking children do not acquire morphological causatives until the age of 3 years, while children acquiring Tzotzil start producing morphological causatives around the age of 2 years. The marked difference in the age of acquisition of causatives in K’iche’ and in Tzotzil has been explained through a morphological difference between causatives in the two languages. This paper, based on longitudinal and spontaneous data, examines acquisition of the causative in Q’anjob’al, a third Mayan language. The question is whether the findings in K’iche’ and Tzotzil are reproduced, or whether the acquisition of Q’anjob’al causatives follows a third, yet-unattested, trajectory. The results show that three Q’anjob’al children, of the age range 1;9-3;0, 2;3-4;0, and 2;7-3;6, acquire the morphological and periphrastic causatives during the third year of life, although these children produce more periphrastic causatives than morphological causatives. Longitudinal and spontaneous studies in K’iche’ and Tzotzil have reported the acquisition of the morphological causative, but not the acquisition of periphrastic causatives. The Q’anjob’al children’s production of more periphrastic causatives might be due to their exposure to a special V1V2 construction, which is a general feature of Q’anjob’al. The Q’anjob’al child data show that even related languages in which causatives are expressed through similar morphemes can show strikingly different acquisition trajectories.",1,0

"Parameters have been used in generative phonology for the last fifteen years, but there is no unified account of what they have to say and how they work. The purpose of this paper is to question the empirical and heuristic value of parameters in most of their uses and to elucidate the relationship between Markedness Theory and parameters. I shall attempt to show that approaches labeled Principles and Parameters (PP) are but a reformulation of Markedness Theory (MT), vitiated by the same defects and leading to the same explanatory failure; that the PP reformulation may in fact be less adequate than former models of MT, since it is even less refutable—mainly because it is less articulated, organized and formalized; and that the function of parameters in current phonological literature seems mainly rhetorical due in part to what seems to be a refusal to define precisely what is a possible candidate for a parameter. We would perhaps want to make a special proviso for the use of parameters in metrical theory, as opposed to their use for segmental and syllabic structures, and in a limited way for Optimality Theory ( Prince and Smolensky, 1993 , Optimality Theory: Constraint Interaction in Generative grammar . Piscataway, N.J.: Rutgers Center for Cognitive Science), for which, although provided with more formal definitions, parameters play a more marginal role, whereas MT is still used as a justification. In the case of metrical theory, parameters have a rather strong and restrictive meaning, whereas in the latter cases they are of a more metaphorical nature. Since markedness theory has not been abandoned, and is still often referred to in the phonological literature, as we will see, universals of grammar in the form of principles and parameters take over, and sometimes mix with, markedness theory, leading to an undesirable situation characterized by parallel, informal and redundant discourses on alleged universals. Statements of PP can be reduced either to ‘primitives’ of markedness theory, that is, implicational laws, or to the simple meaning of ‘any conceivable choice’. It will be suggested that fruitful research for universals and ‘core’ phonology could only begin once we admit that current approaches have mainly concentrated on peripheral properties, and that insight into the specific linguistic capacities of humans could not be attained without factoring out universals for which physiological explanations are readily available and which partake only trivially in the language faculty (for a similar point of view, cf. Singh. 1996. ‘Natural Phonology: A view from the outside’, Natural Phonology: The State of the Art ed. by Bernhard Hurch & Richard Rhodes, 1–38. Berlin: Mouton). The focus will be mainly on three questions: (1) what precisely is the relationship between MT and PP? (2) If (or when) they are the same, is PP only an informal version of a former MT? (3) If not, what is the content of PP (if any)? In the first section, I will briefly sketch the concept of parameter, while the second section will point out the manner in which markedness and markedness theory are referred to, from its formalization in Kean. The Theory of Markedness in Generative Grammer . Bloomington, Ind.: Indiana Univ. Linguistics Club (1980) to a theory of phonological complexity (Calabrese. 1991. The Notion of Phonological Complexity in Phonological Theory: A new approach to Markedness theory . manuscript, Harvard University), default rules of underspecification theories (Archangeli and Pulleyblank. The Content and Structure of Phonological Representations . manuscript, University of Colorado and University of Southern California 1986, Paradis, and Prunet. The Special Status of Coronals . New York: Academic Press), feature geometry, syllabic structures and Optimality Theory. The third section examines definitions and examples given in PP approaches, and will point out the absence of any articulated theory of phonological parameters as well as of any constraining definition of the term, with the consequence of its use as a device to avoid refutability of propositions about universals that do not have anything to do with core grammar. The fourth section points to the more successful use of parameters in metrical theory, and the fifth discusses the explanatory value of MT and PP.",1,0

"Continuing the tradition of this series, which has become a standard reference work in language acquisition, Volume 4 contains chapters on three additional languages/language groups--Finnish, Greek, and Korean. The chapters are selective, critical reviews rather than exhaustive summaries of the course of development of each language. Authors approach the language in question as a case study in a potential crosslinguistic typology of acquisitional problems, considering those data which contribute to issues of general theoretical concern in developmental psycholinguistics and linguistic theory. Each chapter, therefore, provides the following: * Grammatical Sketch of Language. Brief grammatical sketch of the language or language group, presenting those linguistic facts which are relevant to the developmental analysis. * Sources of Evidence. Summary of basic sources of evidence, characterizing methods of gathering data, and listing key references. * Overall Course of Development. Brief summary of the overall course of development in the language or language group, giving an idea of the general problems posed to the child in acquiring a language of this type, summarizing typical errors, domains of relatively error-free acquisition, and the timing of acquisition--areas of the grammar that show relatively precocious or delayed development in crosslinguistic perspective. * Data. Specific developmental aspects of the language examined in depth, depending on each individual language and available acquisition data. * Conclusions. An interpretive summary of theoretical points raised above, attending to general principles of language development and linguistic organization suggested by the study of a language of this type, plus comparisons with development of other languages.",1,0

"This collection of articles originates from a 1997 symposium in which participated some of the most eminent scholars researching lexicography and linguistics, that, since the 1970s, have widely developed to the extent of becoming a thriving market for publishers. Looking back at the evolution of EFL dictionaries for learners and ahead to the use of corpus linguistics for the compilation of a new generation of dictionaries, this volume is of particular interest to lexicographers, although some of its references may now appear slightly outdated.",1,0

"Im Ganzsatz ist das Kriterium für die Bestimmung der Satzform die Anzahl der explizit ausgedrückten Prädikationen. Der Ganzsatz ist dabei ein Oberbegriff, der für alle Satzkonstruktionen stehen kann, deren Erkennungsmerkmale die Majuskel am Anfang und ein Interpunktionszeichen am Ende sind, und somit sowohl Einfachsätze als auch komplexe Sätze umfasst. Der zusammengesetzte Satz kann sowohl parataktisch als auch hypotaktisch gebaut sein. Wichtig dabei ist zu wissen, dass auch Hauptsätze nicht immer von Nebensätzen unabhängig sind und also nicht immer ohne diese stehen können. Durch die Verbvalenz als eine semantisch geprägte Kategorie sind die Grundstruktur und damit die Form eines Satzes prädestiniert. Fakultative Aktanten können fehlen, wenn deren informativer Beitrag im gemeinsamen Wissen der Kommunikationspartner kotextuell oder situativ verankert und daher nachvollziehbar ist. Die Verbvalenz kann auch modifiziert werden. Meistens geht es um eine Art Valenzminderung (Valenzreduktion). In diesem Fall sind auch verkürzte Satzformen ohne obligatorische Aktanten grammatisch richtig und verständlich, soweit pragmatisches Wissen von Kommunikationspartnern aktiviert werden kann. Die Ellipse ist eine unvollständige Satzkonstruktion, die im Prinzip auf einem Verstoß gegen das syntaktische Minimum beruht, jedoch rezeptiv akzeptabel ist, weil sie eine kommunikative Funktion erfüllt.",1,0

"The article proposes a novel analysis of NPN constructions, exemplified by English expressions like back to back and year after year. An NPN is typically composed of two identical bare singular count nouns with a preposition between them. Previous research tends to treat NPNs as highly idiosyncratic. While acknowledging some idiosyncrasies, the present contribution shows that NPNs exhibit a considerable degree of regularity and compositionality. A widespread view that bare singulars normally do not function as arguments is shown to rest on weak foundations. As a consequence, the present approach is able to show that NPNs are, at the core, NPs with PP modifiers. Nominal NPNs have this basic structure, while adverbial NPNs involve an extra layer of semantics and are exocentric constructions. A distinction between nominal types and instances is employed to account for the semantics of bare singulars. NPNs exhibit two kinds of emergent meanings, leading to chain NPNs and twin NPNs. The different semantic structures of these NPN subtypes explain why some NPNs can have nominal in addition to adverbial functions. The data comes mostly from Norwegian. Details differ between languages, but central parts of the analyses can be assumed to hold for other languages as well.",1,0

"Prescriptive analyses of English grammar no doubt post-date the introduction of the printing press to England in 1476, but not by much. As soon as the dissemination of standards for written English became practicable, self-appointed experts working in every area from religion (Bishop Robert Lowth, for example) to science (including Joseph Priestley, the discoverer of oxygen) published their personal recommendations for improving the English language, and the tradition has flourished ever since, even after the advent of linguistics and descriptivism. Best sellers like TV newsman Edwin Newman's Strictly Speaking (1974) and A Civil Tongue (1975), along with film and Broadway critic John Simon's Paradigms Lost (1980), have been followed by an array of more recent prescriptive mass-market guides for the grammatically unwashed, perhaps most entertaining among them, Lynne Truss's popular Eats, Shoots &amp; Leaves (2003), but also Dennis Baron's Guide to Home Language Repair (1994), Patricia O'Conner's Woe Is I (2003), Bill Walsh's Lapsing into a Comma (2000) and The Elephants of Style (2004), and June Casagrande's Grammar Snobs Are Great Big Meanies (2006) and its encore Mortal Syntax (2008).",1,0

"This article reviews the current policy context in the state of Arizona for program options for English language learners and produces a meta-analysis of studies on the effectiveness of bilingual education that have been conducted in the state in or after 1985. The study presents an analysis of a sample of evaluation studies (N = 4), which demonstrates a positive effect for bilingual education on all measures, both in English and the native language of English language learners, when compared to English-only instructional alternatives. We conclude that current state policy is at odds with the best synthesis of the empirical evidence, and we recommend that current policy mandating English-only and forbidding bilingual education be abandoned in favor of program choices made at the level of the local community.",1,0

"Introducing Sign Language Literature: Folklore and Creativity, by Rachel Sutton-Spence and Michiko Kaneko (London: Palgrave Macmillan, 2016, paperback, 280 pages, $45, ISBN: 9781137363817)WHEN PEOPLE talk of literature, they typically mean printed literature. Literary critics typically do not analyze oral literature and sign language literature. That is their loss. This book, Introducing Sign Language Literature: Folklore and Creativity, presents background information, examples, and analysis that illustrate the richness of sign language literature. Studying it can teach us much about cultures, linguistics, and the nature of literature itself.The chapters suggest further readings and class and individual activities, making the book a perfect vehicle around which to build a course. A YouTube channel goes with the book, as does an extensive list of sign poems, stories, and interviews from Brazil, Britain, South Africa, and the United States, along with information on how to access these materials.The book outlines the following sociolinguistic facts and discusses their repercussions. Sign language literature historically includes faceto- face performances in places such as deaf clubs and events such as weddings and funerals. However, it now also includes videos; thus individuals and small groups can experience these performances without living in or having access to a deaf community. Sign language literature includes folklore (which reflects the culture of a community), fiction, and poetry, as well as oratory, autobiographies, chronicles, and religious literature. In some regions (e.g., Brazil and Britain) it puts a high priority on deafness, but in other locales (e.g., South Africa) it prioritizes matters of pressing interest to the larger community (e.g., racial and political issues). The fact that sign language literature is signed is as important as its content, or perhaps even more so; that is, the act of creating and performing sign language literature is political inasmuch as it supports community identity.Given these facts, the context for sign language literature is crucial: when and where it occurs, who the performer is, who the audience is, why the event is occurring, and whether the material reflects cultural heritage or is created solely by the performer. Importantly, sign language literature belongs to everyone. Indeed, signing a joke or a story can be an act of declaring membership in the deaf community. Hearing people who grew up in a family with deaf members can also perform sign language literature for deaf audiences. Still, there are recognized masters-and many of the greats are introduced in this book.Many functions of sign language literature are common to all literature, particularly that found in oppressed communities. Thus it teaches people about the world and their culture; it helps them make sense of the world; it creates and maintains community identity; and it allows performers to demonstrate their skills and artistry. It can put deaf characters in a position of privilege. In all of this, it is particularly helpful to deaf children, the great majority of whom are born into hearing families and may feel that the complications they experience are unique to them. They are in need of being welcomed into deaf culture and experiencing a community in which they are ordinary and normal.But one function of sign language literature is particular to deafness: the linguistic function. For the vast majority of hearing people, access to language is a given. …",1,0

"Deaf Gain: Raising the Stakes for Human Diversity, ed. H-Dirksen L. Bauman and Joseph J. Murray (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2014, 521 pp., softcover, $34.95, ISBN 978-0-8166-9122-7)Deaf Gain: Raising the Stakes for Human Diversity, edited by H-Dirksen Bauman and Joseph Murray, is uniquely situated in the field of Deaf studies. While most books in the field are dissections of Deaf people's experiences or other historical accounts, Deaf Gain delves into various ways in which, because of a different orientation to the world, Deaf people have contributed to our overall society and also explores what it ultimately means to be human.The book is divided into six sections: Philosophical Gains, Language Gains, Language Gains in Action, Sensory Gains, Social Gains, and Creative Gains.The editors begin with a section on terminology, which serves as an orientation. Although many readers may be familiar with Deaf people and the field of Deaf studies, this book lends itself to a wide variety of disciplines, including but not limited to disability studies and cultural/ethnic studies. Thus, this introductory section is of value to those who are unfamiliar with the subject.The first section explores ways in which variation in ableness is a valuable component of biodiversity. The three chapters here rely heavily on the concept that Deaf people are and that society's abnormalizing ideology of Deaf people needs to be debunked.The chapter by James Tabery states that the human species could very well find itself at some point in an environment where being Deaf is a decided advantage over being hearing (p. 33). This highlights the ideological framework that biodiversity is both natural and positive for the survival of our species.The second and third sections investigate ways in which signed languages and research on them adds to our experience. Since William Stokoe's groundbreaking work in the 1960s, the field of has pushed our understanding of language to new heights by including the analysis of signed languages. The topics in these sections range from the origins of language to how the brain understands language. Our favorite part of section 2 is the contribution by Cindee Calton: Linguists were fighting ideological resistance to sign languages both inside and outside of linguistics (p. n6).This resistance occurred on several different levels, from proving that signed languages are full-fledged languages to language policy and planning.This has had a huge impact on-and has many implications for-our understanding of what it means to be human.Building on the second section's theoretical investigation into signed languages, section 3 concentrates on the applicable aspects of linguistic research. All four chapters here discuss various ways in which learning a natural signed language benefits humans. The two chapters that jumped out at us were the one by Peter Hauser and Geo Kartheiser and that by Kristin Snoddon. Both focus on the many advantages of learning a natural signed language, from various processing (face and memory) to baby signing for all children. One cannot diminish the value of signed language to everyone:  [A]ll parents, regardless of whether they have deaf children, should be aware of Sign Gain, because learning a sign language is a great brain exercise (p. 143). This statement on the importance of signed languages to humans sums up section 3 perfectly. …",1,0

"Since ancient times India has been a multilingual society and languages in India have thrived though at times many races and religions came into conflict. The states in modern India were reorganised on linguistic basis in 1956 yet in contrast to the European notion of one language one nation, majority of the states have more than one official language. The Linguistic Survey of India (LSI) conducted by Grierson between 1866 and 1927 identified 179 languages and 544 dialects. The first post-independence Indian census after (1951) listed 845 languages including dialects. The 1991 Census identified 216 mother tongues were identified while in 2001 their number was 234. The three-language formula devised to maintain the multilingual character of the nation and paying due attention to the importance of mother tongue is widely accepted in the country in imparting the education at primary and secondary levels. However, higher education system in India impedes multilingualism. According the Constitution it is imperative on the “Union to promote the spread of the Hindi language, to develop it so that it may serve as a medium of expression for all the elements of the composite culture of India … by drawing, wherever necessary or desirable, for its vocabulary, primarily on Sanskrit and secondarily on other languages.” However, the books translated into Hindi mainly from English have found favour with neither the students nor the teachers. On the other hand the predominance of English in various competitive examinations has caused social discontent leading to mass protests and cases have been filed in the High Courts and the Supreme Court against linguistic imperialism of English and Hindi. The governments may channelize the languages but in a democratic set up it is ultimately the will of the people that prevails. Some languages are bound to suffer a heavy casualty both in the short and long runs in the process.",1,0

"Abstract While the bulk of feedback studies have focused on written corrective feedback, oral feedback in teacher-student writing conferences in EFL context has been underexplored. This article investigated teacher oral feedback based on the tenets of sociocultural theory. It examined the impact of teacher-student writing conferences on students’ accuracy and frequency of cohesive devices employment. The study followed a quasi-experimental design with a pre-test, intervention and post-test. Data were collected from an intensive writing course for intermediate students at the college level. Based on guided-free writing prompts, the students had to write argumentative paragraphs of about 150–180 words followed by individual conference sessions to offer them oral feedback. The findings showed that oral feedback in writing conferences statistically impacted the students’ writing performance with huge effect size (Cohen’s d = 2.19). Moreover, the results demonstrated empirical evidence that writing conferences positively impacted the students’ frequency of employing referential markers (t value = − 3.011; p = 0.006 &lt; 0.05) and conjunctions (t value = − 2.200; p = 0.039 &lt; 0.05). Further, oral feedback statistically impacted the students’ accuracy of utilizing referential markers (t value = − 6.874; p = 0.000 &lt; 0.05) and conjunctions (t value = − 7.253; p = 0.000 &lt; 0.05). Writing conferences provided mediated learning experience for the students. The oral feedback assisted the students to decrease the overuse of the first, second person pronouns and the definite article ‘the’ with generic meaning in their writing. Instead, they depended on noun phrases and the third person pronouns which contributed to the text overall cohesion by creating explicit chains of references to the antecedents within the textual environment. Also, oral feedback helped the students to use conjunctions appropriately and accurately, so their texts were written densely cohesive. Pedagogical implications were discussed at the end of the article.",1,0

Das philologische Verständnis der Texte macht heute fast keine Schwierigkeiten mehr; sprachwissenschaftlich ist aber das Hethitische trotz der mehr als vierzigjährigen Forschungen noch heute im allgemeinen ebensowenig geklärt wie im Anfang der Forschung, genauer: die meisten Probleme lassen sich auch heute noch nicht einwandfrei lösen. Und eine der schwierigsten Fragen ist eben die Lautgeschichte dieser Sprache, denn gerade das Lautsystem der Keilschriftsprachen wird durch die geradezu monstruösen Schwankungen und Unebenheiten der Keilschrift besonders stark verschleiert.

L'ouvrage auquel nous avons a faire ici a pour ambition de permettre une nouvelle lecture plus fiable et d'eclaircir quelques points obscurs. Une page de garde fortement usagee, precedent la partie de Prudentius, composee du fragment d'un censier comportant environ 200 noms propres pourrait nous faire des revelations sur l'histoire du manuscrit. Les graphies sont caracteristiques de l'anthroponymie dans les sources francaises, et, de plus, les noms de lieux des domaines mentionnes se trouvent dans la region de l'abbaye St. Mihiel en Lorraine. On peut peut-etre en deduire que le manuscrit de Prudentius a ete en possession du monastere avant d'etre acquis par Antoine Loisel, son premier proprietaire connu. Le manuscrit a ensuite appartenu a la bibliotheque de Notre-Dame de Paris et a rejoint ce qui fut autrefois la Bibliotheque Royale en 1756.",1,0

"Abstract The language policy of Turkey’s state-run Kurdish television station (TRT Kurdî) allows for Kurdish-Turkish hybridity, which reflects common practice among Turkish Kurds (Schluter, Anne. 2014. Competing or compatible language identities in Istanbul’s Kurmanji workplaces? In Kristina Kamp, Ayhan Kaya, Fuat Keyman &amp; Özge Onursal-Beşgül (eds.), Contemporary Turkey at a Glance. Interdisciplinary Perspectives on Local and Trans-local Dynamics , 125–137. Wiesbaden, Germany: Springer.) and promotes ownership among minority language speakers (Hinnenkamp, Volker. 2003. Mixed language varieties of migrant adolescents and the discourse of hybridity. Journal of Multilingual and Multicultural Development 24(1–2). 12–41.). Nevertheless, the mixing of Turkish and apparent disregard for Kurdish language rules has led some of the target audience to reject the station (Öpengin, Ergin. 2012. Sociolinguistic situation of Kurdish in Turkey: Sociopolitical factors and language use patterns. International Journal of the Sociology of Language 217. 151–180.). Such attention to form, according to (Lemon, Alaina. 2002. Form and function in Soviet stage Romani: Modeling metapragmatics through performance institutions. Language in Society 31. 29–64.) is usually reserved for minority language activists and dominant language speakers whereas marginalized minority language speakers frequently focus on function. Through semi-structured interviews with twenty politically engaged Kurdish migrants of Istanbul, the current study investigated metalinguistic criticisms about the station to deconstruct perceptions of the suitability of a hybrid Kurdish broadcasting language in relation to findings from (Lemon, Alaina. 2002. Form and function in Soviet stage Romani: Modeling metapragmatics through performance institutions. Language in Society 31. 29–64.) and (Hinnenkamp, Volker. 2003. Mixed language varieties of migrant adolescents and the discourse of hybridity. Journal of Multilingual and Multicultural Development 24(1–2). 12–41.). In contrast to (Hinnenkamp, Volker. 2003. Mixed language varieties of migrant adolescents and the discourse of hybridity. Journal of Multilingual and Multicultural Development 24(1–2). 12–41.), participants viewed linguistic hybridity on TRT Kurdî as iconic (Irvine, Judith &amp; Susan Gal. 2000. Language ideology and linguistic differentiation. In Paul V. Kroskrity (ed.), Regimes of language: ideologies, politics, and identities , 35–84. Santa Fe, NM: School of American Research Press.) of the Turkish state’s agenda to assimilate its Kurdish population. Furthermore, the transfer of this agenda onto a sub-group within the same in-group, TRT Kurdî’s producers, provided evidence of fractal recursivity (Irvine, Judith &amp; Susan Gal. 2000. Language ideology and linguistic differentiation. In Paul V. Kroskrity (ed.), Regimes of language: ideologies, politics, and identities , 35–84. Santa Fe, NM: School of American Research Press.). Results call for a broadening of Lemon (2002) to allow for the inclusion of a larger portion of minority language-speaking populations whose language, similar to the Istanbul-resident Kurdish community profiled in the current study, has been deeply politicized.",1,0

"Charles Wayne restarted funding in speech and language in the mid-1980s after a funding winter brought on by Pierce’s glamour-and-deceit criticisms in the ALPAC report and ‘Whither Speech Recognition’. Wayne introduced a new glamour-and-deceit-proof idea, an emphasis on evaluation. No other sort of program could have been funded at the time, at least in America. One could argue that Wayne has been so successful that the program no longer needs him to continue on. These days, shared tasks and leaderboards have become common place in speech and language (and vision and machine learning) research. That said, I am concerned that the community may not appreciate what it has got until it’s gone. Wayne has been doing much more than merely running competitions, but he did what he did in such a subtle Columbo-like way. Going forward, government funding is being eclipsed by consumer markets.

"CAREFUL READERS HAVE NOTED the prevalence of dangling constructions in the work of writers of a hundred years ago, their eyes no doubt sharpened by present-day teaching practices which warn against infelicitous word order and illogical placing ofmodifiers. Melville's 'Bartleby the Scrivener' shows no less than seven such lapses; similar lapses are found in his other works as well as in those of his contemporary, Hawthorne.' Such constructions are probably not, for the most part, particularly noteworthy. They do not destroy the author's meaning and may be viewed tolerantly as a by-product of the old Latinized rhetoric which left the reader responsible for fitting the modifiers to the most plausible name word. But in 'Bartleby,' these questionable structures are found to have a bearing on the characterization, not so much of Bartleby as of his employer, and hence to aid the reader in discovering a new meaning in this enigmatic tale. The story of Bartleby, related by his employer, a Wall Street lawyer, is that of an eccentric scrivener, obviously a capable workman, who early in his employment declares he will not write. Nevertheless, he remains in the office, refuses to be dismissed, and becomes more and more an enigma and affliction to his employer. This situation is unusual enough to focus the reader's attention on Bartleby to the neglect of the employer, who is usually regarded as merely standing in for the author in recounting the actions of Bartleby. But to neglect the lawyer and his significant character change in this story is, it seems to me, to overlook one of the obvious intentions of the author. Not only does Melville cause the lawyer to describe himself at some lengthhis situation in life, his offices, his other employees-but he devotes many pages to soliloquies on the part of the legal gentleman as he puzzles, not only over his employee's inexplicable behavior, but introspectively about its effect upon himself and how he should most sensibly and effectively respond to it.

"Abstract In the past, several authors have proposed comparable sets of clinical features to differentiate acquired neurogenic stuttering (ANS) from developmental stuttering (DS). Further, people with ANS have been reported to show no changes in their dysfluencies during various fluency-enhancing conditions. Although these features have been criticized on their aptness and reliability in differentiating the two disorders (e.g., Lebrun, Bijleveld, & Rousseau, 1990 ), clinicians and researchers around the world continue to use them even today. In this context, we compile evidence from investigations employing fluency-enhancing conditions in people with ANS to highlight that this group shows extreme variability (including beneficial effects) under such conditions. Further, by combining the evidence from this review as well as that of Lebrun and colleagues', we propose that the clinical features that are used to differentiate ANS from DS are often unreliable. Additionally, we highlight on: (a) the heterogeneity in the manifestation of ANS, (b) recent attempts to draw similarity between ANS and DS, as well as (c) the surprising dearth of functional neuroimaging investigations in ANS that could pave potential ways to future investigations in this fluency disorder.",1,0

"Born in Lossiemouth, Scotland, in 1926, John Stewart joined the army near the end of World War II, and in August 1945 was sent to serve in both Indonesia and Palestine, where he showed his flair for languages. In 1947 he began his degree course in French at Edinburgh University, which entailed a year as Lecteur d'Anglais at Caen University, France. He was awarded a First-class MA and a French L-es-L. In 1951 he was awarded a postgraduate studentship in African studies at the School of Oriental and African Studies, London, where his Head of Department was Malcolm Guthrie, who was then fully engaged in his comparative Bantu research. John's initial assignment was to study Fante, and after a year at SOAS he was sent to Cape Coast in the then Gold Coast for a year's field study. Newly arrived, this courteous young Scot was roundly berated by an angry resthouse caretaker for greeting him on the way to the toilet. Back at SOAS Stewart began work on his PhD thesis: The verbal system of Fante, with especial reference to tone and glottalization. In 1960 SOAS sent him to the Ivory Coast, where he collected a rich harvest of word lists in all the Lagoon languages and Baule, which underlay his subsequent comparative work. Leaving SOAS in 1961, Stewart was appointed Research Fellow at the new Institute of African Studies, University of Ghana, at Legon. During the next decade he deepened his knowledge of Twi and Fante, and collected word lists in all the Akan languages of southern Ghana, some spoken only in one small town. The post involved teaching, too. While at SOAS Stewart had felt challenged by Guthrie's opinion that Bantu was self-contained and, that though other languages might show Bantu-like features, nothing of significance would emerge from wider comparative studies. It was therefore with great surprise, and some reserve on Guthrie's part, that Stewart was able to demonstrate that some of the Akan starred forms that he was elaborating, following Guthrie's own stringent method, were well relatable to Guthrie's Common Bantu starred forms. In due course Stewart, taking the Guthrie forms as given, was able to arrive at Proto-Potou-Akanic-Bantu, as it came to be known. Stewart had become increasingly dissatisfied with what was said about the two sets of vowels in the harmony systems. Basically there was a 'closed' set: [i e a o u], and an 'open' set: [ι e a ⊃ ∪], but no common feature other than 'openness' or its opposite was ever proposed, and, as [ι] and [∪] were respectively midway between [i] and [e], and [o] and [u], any pairing seemed arbitrary. One day Stewart happened to notice that his young informant's prominent Adam's apple was more prominent for some vowels than for others: for [i, e] and [o, u] the underside of his jaw was smooth down to his throat, while for [ι, e] and [⊃, ∪] his chin was somewhat tucked in and his Adam's apple stood out strongly. …",1,0

"Word embeddings have become important building blocks that are used profoundly in natural language processing (NLP). Despite their several advantages, word embeddings can unintentionally accommodate some gender- and ethnicity-based biases that are present within the corpora they are trained on. Therefore, ethical concerns have been raised since word embeddings are extensively used in several high-level algorithms. Studying such biases and debiasing them have recently become an important research endeavor. Various studies have been conducted to measure the extent of bias that word embeddings capture and to eradicate them. Concurrently, as another subfield that has started to gain traction recently, the applications of NLP in the field of law have started to increase and develop rapidly. As law has a direct and utmost effect on people’s lives, the issues of bias for NLP applications in legal domain are certainly important. However, to the best of our knowledge, bias issues have not yet been studied in the context of legal corpora. In this article, we approach the gender bias problem from the scope of legal text processing domain. Word embedding models that are trained on corpora composed by legal documents and legislation from different countries have been utilized to measure and eliminate gender bias in legal documents. Several methods have been employed to reveal the degree of gender bias and observe its variations over countries. Moreover, a debiasing method has been used to neutralize unwanted bias. The preservation of semantic coherence of the debiased vector space has also been demonstrated by using high-level tasks. Finally, overall results and their implications have been discussed in the scope of NLP in legal domain.",1,0

"This issue of Natural Language Engineering journal reports on recent achievements in the domain of HPSG -based parsing. Research groups at Saarbrücken, CSLI Stanford and the University of Tokyo have worked on grammar development and processing systems that allow the use of HPSG -based processing in practical application contexts. Much of the research reported here has been collaborative, and all of the work shares a commitment to producing comparable results on wide-coverage grammars with substantial test suites. The focus of this special issue is deliberately narrow, to allow detailed technical reports on the results obtained among the collaborating groups. Thus, the volume cannot aim at providing a complete survey on the current state of the field. This introduction summarizes the research background for the work reported in the issue, and puts the major new approaches and results into perspective.

"William G. Moulton Mark L. Louden [ Correction: click here ] William Gamwell Moulton, Professor Emeritus of Linguistics and Germanic Languages and Literatures at Princeton University, passed away on June 2, 2000, in Exeter, New Hampshire, at the age of eighty-six. Professor Moulton served as a member of the executive committee of the Linguistic Society of America, as well as its vice president, and, in 1967, its president. Moulton was born February 5, 1914, in Providence, RI. Like so many linguists of his generation, he came to the field by way of an interest in—and exceptional talent for—languages. As he himself put it in an autobiographical essay, ‘[i]n my day, no one planned to “become a linguist”: we all stumbled into it, entering by the back door, because there was no front door’ (Moulton 1980:60). Moulton’s path toward linguistics was anything but stumbling. Already as a boy he was an assiduous student of Latin, French, and German. He began his undergraduate education at Princeton in 1931 where he pursued a dual degree in French and German, as well as a program in international relations. He was awarded a bachelor’s degree with first-class honors in 1935. After graduating from Princeton, Moulton received a scholarship to study languages for a year at the University of Berlin. During that year he met Jenni Karding, whom he married on July 7, 1938. In 1936 Moulton enrolled at Yale for graduate study, where he began work with Eduard Prokosch. In those days, Yale was clearly THE place to study linguistics as it emerged from traditional philology. It actually took me the better part of a year to discover ‘linguistics’ at Yale. It began with the Gothic course which I took from Prokosch. Then, somewhere during that first year, I discovered that there was at Yale a professor named Edward Sapir. Though he was on leave during my second year, I took his course in phonetics and phonemics in the fall of 1938—shortly before his death in early 1939. By this time I had also had the sense to take courses with Edgar H. Sturtevant (for Comparative Grammar of Greek and Latin) and with Franklin B. Edgerton (for a year of Sanskrit). Prokosch died in an auto accident in the summer of 1938, but he was in a sense replaced by his son-in-law Hans Kurath who for two years came two days a week from Brown University to teach courses in Germanic linguistics. There may have been very few students of linguistics in Yale in those years, but we were hardly underprivileged. What a galaxy of stars: Prokosch, Sapir, Sturtevant, Edgerton and Kurath! (Moulton 1980:59) In 1940 Leonard Bloomfield came to Yale and supervised Moulton as he completed the dissertation project begun under Prokosch. The following year, Moulton finished his dissertation, Swiss German dialect and Romance patois, which was published that same year as a supplement (17.4) to Language (Moulton 1941). This monograph, one of the very first to examine the structural effects of language contact in a rigorous way, advanced the frontiers of German dialectology and structural linguistics more generally by examining the role of Germanic-Romance contact in the historical development of sound systems in the Wallis/Valais region of Switzerland. It also established Moulton’s reputation among German-speaking Swiss scholars as one of the pioneers in Swiss German dialectology, a reputation that endures today. While Moulton’s dissertation marked his entry into the fields of Swiss German dialectology and contact linguistics, he came to his topic by way of a straightforward historical linguistic question pertaining to Old High German vocalism. [End Page 161] One day in the spring of 1938 the late Professor Eduard Prokosch of Yale University suggested that I might find a topic for my doctoral dissertation in the general field of Old High German final vowels. In going through the work that has been done on this subject, the greatest stumbling block which I found was the assumption, made by many scholars, that certain final vowels must have been long in OHG because they still survive in a few modern dialects, especially in southwestern Switzerland. When I turned...",1,0

"We are pleased to present Aspect in Slavic: Creating Time, Creating Grammar as a special issue of the Journal of Slavic Linguistics. Here we offer some of the research results of the CLEAR (Cognitive Linguistics: Empirical Approaches to Russian) group at the University of Tromso and our collaborators. This research was sponsored by a grant from the Norwegian Research Council for a project entitled Neat Theories, Messy Realities and by a grant from the Centre for Advanced Study at the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters for a project entitled Time Is Space: Unconscious Models and Conscious Acts. (1) All of the contributions to this special issue approach topics relating to the metaphorical representation and evolution of grammar, particularly with respect to verbs and their interpretation. In this introduction I will situate these works with respect to relevant research on the role of cognitive processes in structuring grammar (e.g., Coulson 2006, Fauconnier and Turner 2002 and 2008, Langacker 2006 and 2008), and on the metaphorical structure of aspect (Croft 2012). As human beings, we tend to think of reality as something objectively separate from ourselves that is delivered to our perceptual organs in conveniently discrete units. However, there is ample evidence that this is a naive and incomplete view. Instead, external input is processed in an interactive fashion that creates structure beyond what is out there. As Coulson (2006) points out, vision is an excellent example of this interactive process. At the place where the optic nerve passes through the retina, there are no photoreceptor cells, so we have no visual input. Yet we do not experience a hole in the visual field, because our brains fill in what would be missing. Blinking also disrupts visual input for about 100-400 milliseconds about 10 times per minute, but we don't notice any discontinuity thanks again to the completion effected by our brains. Researchers in robotics face enormous obstacles due to the differences between our human experience of vision, in which boundaries and objects are easy to see, as opposed to cameras, which are unable to detect the relevant discontinuities. Various optical illusions are made possible by the constructive nature of vision, which is context-sensitive and able to interpolate where input is inadequate due to differences in lighting, viewpoint angle, or obstructions. Language is similarly context-sensitive and constructive. Fauconnier and Turner (2002 and 2008) present a detailed model of how cognitive processes such as conceptual integration and compression make the construction of meaning possible. The full meaning of an utterance is not encoded in the linguistic string. Instead, background knowledge and context are essential resources in making meaning possible. More crucially, use of language often involves partitioning and organizing information in creative ways, given that new structure can emerge as a result of cognitive processes. We can create distinctions: the perfective versus imperfective distinction is not something that exists objectively; instead, it is creatively projected onto perceived events, and different language communities are free to construct such distinctions in different ways. Thanks to blending, we can integrate mental spaces that clash with reality and thus conceive of things that don't exist, as in the use of modals, counterfactuals, and future tense (Fauconnier and Turner 2002: chapter 11). We can even assign multiple interpretations to a single item of realia, such as snails (which evokes a biological frame) vs. escargot (which evokes a culinary frame; Langacker 2008: 49). Coulson (2006) makes the case that parallels between the fundamentally constructive processes of vision and of language are not merely accidental. They likely rely upon the same neurological mechanisms of connectivity, in which the behavior of any given neuron is influenced by others that connect to it, yielding networks of cells that fire simultaneously. …",1,0

"Accurately recognizing emotion from speech is a necessary yet challenging task due to the variability in speech and emotion. In this paper, a novel method combined self-attention mechanism and multi-scale fusion framework is proposed for multi-modal SER by using speech and text information. A self-attentional bidirectional contextual LSTM (bc-LSTM) is proposed to learn the context-sensitive dependences from speech. Specifically, the BLSTM layer is applied to learn long-term dependencies and utterance-level contextual information and the multi-head self-attention layer makes the model focus on the features that are most related to the emotions. A self-attentional multi-channel CNN (MCNN), which takes advantage of static and dynamic channels, is applied for learning general and thematic features from text. Finally, a multi-scale fusion strategy, including feature-level fusion and decision-level fusion, is applied to improve the overall performance. Experimental results on the benchmark dataset IEMOCAP demonstrate that our method gains an absolute improvement of 1.48% and 3.00% over state-of-the-art strategies in terms of weighted accuracy (WA) and unweighted accuracy (UA), respectively.",1,0

Dans une perspective où la production langagière est considérée comme prise de risque langagière, nous étudions la façon dont l’humour fait partie intégrante d’un scénario pédagogique ou au contraire fait irruption dans une séquence. L’humour convoque en effet des émotions variées, puisqu’il représente, selon les cas, une prise de risque pédagogique pour l’enseignant ou un risque de perte de face pour l’apprenant.

"Per Hage died of leukemia on the 25th of July 2004, just as he was hitting his stride in world kinship studies. His interests in the Pacific had been especially welcome in a region that had seen little linguistic or other culture historic work on kinship. His obituary in l'Homme earlier this year speaks to his life from a social anthropologist's perspective. Per is remembered for his support of the linguists, part of which was showing deeper uses of extant data through markedness studies and other sorts of reasoning. It was only roughly ten years ago that Per returned in earnest to the topic of some of his earliest publications: kinship. A period of work with the mathematician Frank Harary had seen publications from 1981 to 1998 that occasionally concerned kinship and typically involved application of Boolean reductions, graph models, hierarchical opposition, minimum spanning trees, and other such topics and methods that leaned toward the mathematical. His focus since about 1996 developed into a sustained assault on culture history issues, mainly kinship, including the publication of the Proto-Oceanic matrilineality hypothesis in 1998 (Was Proto-Oceanic society matrilineal?) and posthumous publications on the kinship situation in East Bantu (Dravidian kinship systems in Africa in l'Homme earlier this year, and Kin terms in the Bantu proto language ..., a forthcoming work completed after Per's death with the help of the Belgian linguist, Koen Bostoen, and the Congolese linguist, Jean-Georges Kamba Muzenga). So in addition to having first articulated the Proto-Oceanic matrilineality model, Per will be remembered as the social anthropologist on the seminal comparative Bantu kin term project. I was troubled by his 1996 invitation to begin working together on the culture history of Oceanic kinship. I worried that he or I would somehow blunder or fail. I worried that he might have theoretical biases. But I eventually read his Unthinkable categories (1997) and realized, from that reading, that he was merely and quite thoroughly like many linguists: he simply liked puzzles. My fears allayed, I began reading more of his publications and began working with him in 1999. His path had crossed with linguistics previously in work on proximity, dialect, and kinship in the Tuamotus and elsewhere (Island networks ..., 1996). His kinship and kin term work then began to range from general culture history to markedness (The logical structure ... [1996], Marking universals ... [1999], Reconstructing ancestral Oceanic society ... [1999], The marking of sex distinctions ... [2001], and other works). Hage published the Proto-Oceanic matrilineality model rather instantly upon deciding it was the best possible model (1998), while Polynesian kin terms and descent groups, published in that same year, still reflects earlier opinions. In a grand sense, the matrilineality model is appealing because it states that the variability in Oceanic Austronesian societies' descent systems is due to a matrilineal society that radiated and then made local or regional changes (where they are not still matrilineal). In that paper (Was Proto-Oceanic society matrilineal?) he expanded upon Blust's observation that matrilineal societies often have dead mother constructions for orphan while patrilineal societies often have dead father constructions for the same. Similarly, before his death, he often commented on finding, in instances where man's sister and woman's brother were collapsed into a single category and term (cross-sex sibling), that it was the man's sister term that often survived to name the cross-sex sibling in matrilineal societies while the woman's brother term often survived to name the cross-sex sibling category in patrilineal and cognatic societies. The Proto-Oceanic matrilineality model was apparently the kind of overall argument that neither the linguists nor the anthropologists knew how to evaluate, and any reference to it at all seems lacking in the literature until after we published (Matrilineality and the Melanesian origin of Polynesian Y chromosomes [2003]) our opinion of why the emerging human genetic evidence could only be consistent with matrilocality (and the implication that a matrilocal society, over time, would only be matrilineal). …",1,0

"Resume 
Cette analyse tend a mettre en evidence la difference entre le quantificateur generique non exprime lexicalement et les quantificateurs explicites, par exemple des adverbes de quantification. Nous nous attachons a montrer que le quantificateur generique a une nature modale, qui se manifeste sous des formes differentes pour le defini et l’indefini, tandis que la quantification adverbiale est intrinsequement existentielle. Le deuxieme aspect de la genericite examine ici est la relation entre la structuration categorique ou thetique du jugement et la forme que prend la modalite generique. Nous proposons que la distinction entre les jugements thetiques et categoriques qui s’applique aux phrases existentielles, caracterise egalement les phrases generiques avec un sujet indefini et que, selon la structuration, categorique ou thetique, de l’enonce, la modalite generique prend des formes differentes.",1,0

"It is becoming increasingly common for linguists to testify as expert witnesses in both civil and criminal trials. Often linguistic expertise is clearly helpful to the judge or jury. Based on published judicial opinions, from which we draw our data, it appears that courts have allowed linguists to testify on such issues as the probable origin of a speaker, the comprehensibility of a text, whether a particular defendant understood the Miranda warning, and the phonetic similarity of two competing trademarks. In other areas the admissibility of linguistic testimony has been more controversial, including author and speaker identification, discourse analysis, the meaning of legal texts, and the comprehensibility of jury instructions. Reasons for judicial reluctance to admit linguistic expertise include concerns that it is not sufficiently reliable, the belief that issues like the meaning of a text can just as well be decided by a jury, and sometimes even institutional and political considerations. Despite such reservations, courts generally recognize that there is a place for linguistic expertise in appropriate cases.",1,0

"El presente artículo tiene como objetivo presentar una propuesta teórico-crítica acerca del problema del binarismo de la colonialidad occidental presente en el lenguaje español, a partir de la perspectiva de la descolonialidad lingüística como lectura de la literatura de lingüística (generativista), neurociencia (cognitiva) y del estudio del lenguaje como objeto natural. Se revisa la problemática del binarismo lingüístico y los principales factores involucrados, así como también se exploran las formaciones cognitivo-lingüísticas de la matriz colonial de ordenamiento epistémico y lingüístico para proponer una posible ruptura con este binarismo presente en el lenguaje y lengua, para la búsqueda de unas nuevas lingüísticas que se localicen en unos otros locus de enunciación, que devuelvan a las y los sujetos la ilusión de ser dueños de su decir.",1,0

提要 在情态研究中，对主观情态与客观情态的区别的认识远非清楚。现代汉语的情态表达，从如下方面表现出主观与客观的区别：（一）不同类型情态的情态动词连续同现遵循的EDD规则，体现了不同类型的情态之间主观与客观的区别，它要求主观性强的情态类型先于主观性弱的情态类型排列。（二）表达同义情态的两个情态动词的同现，原因在于它们表达的情态存在主观和客观的区别，两个同义情态动词同现时，主观情态先于客观情态。（三）表达同义情态的不同情态构式存在功能上的差别，原因也在于它们表达的同义情态存在主观与客观的差别。（四）出于语用目的，现代汉语存在大量的情态客观化表达，说明主观情态与客观情态的区别存在语用动因。,1,0

"IN THE Preface to the third edition of his Dictionary of Americanisms, Bartlett said: 'I acknowledge my indebtedness to the Rev. R. Manning CHIPMAN, Of New Lisbon, Conn., for annotations on the previous edition of this work and very copious lists of words. The extent to which Bartlett was indebted is not readily apparent from this meager acknowledgment. However, there is in existence the actual volume on which the annotations were made,2 and from an examination of it may be drawn some conclusions concerning Chipman's contribution to the study of Americanisms and the actual debts that later compilers owe him. Richard Manning Chipman3 (1806-93) was born in Salem, Massachusetts, and lived most of his life in New England. His family traced its descent from one John Chipman who settled in Boston in 1631. R. Manning Chipman graduated from Dartmouth College at the age of sixteen and studied divinity in Princeton and New York. He was ordained (a Congregationalist) in 1835 and thereafter held a succession of pastorates in Connecticut and Massachusetts before coming to Lisbon, Connecticut, in 1871, after which his movements are not recorded. He was apparently interested in linguistic and antiquarian studies, and makes frequent references in his annotations to his unpublished 'Etym[ological?]. Mem[orandum?].' He was a frequent contributor to public journals, published theological pamphlets, genealogical studies, including one of his own family, and the history of a New England town.4 While at Wolcottville (now Torrington), Connecticut, in 1859, Chipman acquired a copy of the second edition, published in that year, of",1,0

Nuestro interés se centra en analizar, desde la perspectiva de la Gramática Sistémico-Funcional (Halliday, 1994, 2004b), las particularidades de la metáfora gramatical ideacional en español y sus implicaciones para la formación ciudadana y el aprendizaje. El corpus lo conforman tres capítulos de textos para octavo grado que aluden a la Revolución Industrial. El proceso seguido para realizar nuestros análisis nos ha permitido identificar la presencia de metáforas gramaticales en los términos hallidayanos: nominalizaciones de procesos y cualidades, y el uso de verbos causales en lugar de conjunciones. Asimismo, hemos identificado otros tipos de metáforas: cláusulas no ergativas, presente histórico, participantes no animados.

漢語的情態助動詞「會」有一些不同於其他情態詞的語義特性，它的語義演變過程至今仍有爭議 。「會」語義特性的產生動因和它的語義演變路徑是本研究要探索的兩個問題。我們在發掘「會」的條件必然等功能的基礎上，以「語義地圖模型」為理論工具通過跨方言／語言的比較構擬了它的情態語義演變路徑，最後用「語義結構分析法」檢驗該路徑的合理性。我們認為該構擬的解釋力在於：符合代表跨語言共性的語義地圖，可解釋「會」及相關情態詞的語義特性，推進了情態語義地圖的研究。另外，在與「能」「要」等近義情態詞的比較中，我們也剖析了「會」的用法特點。本研究是用語義地圖來解釋具體語言現象的嘗試，從中可見：特定語言內的跨方言比較可以補充並豐富跨語言共性的研究。,1,0

"HE open industry that emerged on the High Plains following the Civil War and the completion of the transcontinental railroads has occasioned a considerable amount of descriptive literature. For the most part, however, this centers about the cowboy and his trade. Long removed from the picture, the cowboy has been made into a more or less heroic figure by his admiring interpreters. His occupation, distinctive dress, and manner of life caught the imagination of a sympathetic public, and have been given serious study; his lingo and songs have been carefully collected; and more recently, Ernest Staple Osgood, in The Day of the Cattleman (Minneapolis, 1929), has subjected his employer to a careful scrutiny. But the cowboy's more submissive neighbor, the sheep herder, appears to have suffered from neglect. With his unpretentious garb, harmless trade implements, and dreary occupation, the shepherd could hope for little popular acclaim before such a competitor as the glamorous cowboy, with his chaps, pistols, lariat, and bronco. Less appealing and picturesque than his two-gun opponent, the successor of the sage shepherd of old experienced for a moment an unwanted notoriety, when, his flocks scattered and killed and his own life threatened and endangered, he occupied one side of a controversy that promised for a time to engulf a large section of the West. With an age-old tradition of peace, the shepherd, now transplanted to a western where cattlemen saw their long asserted range rights contested, found himself involved in a deadly war. But when this had passed he immediately resumed his former obscurity. The sheep and his employer, the flock master, even before their conflict with the cowboy and the cattleman, had begun to make an indelible impress on nomenclature and lingo. The distinctly open character of western wool and mutton production gave prevalence to methods of conducting the business only suggested at an earlier date. Phrases and words expressive of new ways of doing things came into general use on the western sheep range, and the war itself made accretions to a vocabulary that was already becoming somewhat distinctive. Open sheep raising has always required the services of at least two men for each outfit, the herder and the camp tender. 355",1,0

"Este trabajo tiene como objetivo avanzar en el conocimiento de las formas de representación del discurso en español oral. Con esta finalidad, presenta un estudio de las citas directas y un análisis variacionista de las expresiones que las introducen en las narraciones orales del Atlas lingüístico y etnográfico de Castilla La Mancha (ALeCMan). Tras analizar las entrevistas realizadas a 12 informantes estratificados socialmente en la ciudad de Cuenca, se han seleccionado las narraciones orales surgidas en dichas entrevistas y se han localizado 339 citas directas. En el análisis cualitativo, las citas directas se clasificaron en cinco tipos: cita de un acto de habla, cita de un pensamiento, turno en diálogo reconstruido, cita no lingüística y cita literal, mientras que los marcos introductores encontrados fueron seis: verbo dicendi, verbo cero, sintagma nominal, otros verbos, verbos de pensamiento y el reformulador explicativo es decir. El análisis variacionista se realizó tomando como variable dependiente el marco de la cita y como variables independientes los tipos de citas, los factores sociales (edad, el sexo o género y nivel de instrucción) y el estilo o grado de formalidad.

"This article argues that in Uf, va dir ell (1978), Quim Monzo complicates the idea of a nationalist politics rooted in language by shifting the reader's attention from voice, textuality, and orality to the role of aurality in producing subjectivity. Constructing a series of listening subjects who move through urban soundscapes, the collection construes sound as a felt, corporeal experience that is communicated textually via onomatopoeia, prosodic rhythm, and the representation of a globalized soundscape. As the article shows, this globalized aural construction of space, language, and subjectivity challenges nationalist attempts to link language directly to Catalan national identity. Nevertheless, by addressing the work to an audience who must hear the soundscape as they read, the collection ultimately reinserts sound into a politically-engaged aural imaginary defined by the Catalan community. The reader as listener, then, occupies a dual position, both corporeally hearing language as sound and understan...",1,0

"The history of Ethiopia has witnessed a constant struggle between centralizing forces and regional powers. Since 1991 the pendulum has swung clearly toward a policy of “ethnic federalism.” Nevertheless, to date only a few of the about eighty ethnic groups of Ethiopia have implemented the right to fully develop their own language and use it in education and administration, as enshrined in the new federal constitution. Actually, only Oromo (the second or possibly even the first language of the country in demographic terms) has been equipped to become a full-fledged medium in the fields of education, administration, and publication. For many other languages, reshaping has been limited to the selection of an orthography, accompanied by the introduction of the local language in the first years of the school curriculum and the production of primers or dictionaries. After a comparison with the previous language policies of the country and of neighboring Eritrea, the article discusses the problems facing the standardization and Ausbauization of Ethiopian languages: orthographic choices, the selection of the official variety to be implemented, the elaboration of modern technical vocabulary, and the production of high-quality written material.",1,0

"In recent decades, bilingual education policies, programs, pedagogies, and practices have been constrained by neoliberal agendas which have undermined the radical vision of bilingual education as a means toward self-determination that the Chicana/o Movement youth articulated more than 50 years ago. This narrowing of educational possibilities has perpetuated the marginalization of bi/multilingual students from Chicana/o/x and Latina/o/x backgrounds who comprise the majority of “English-language Learners” in public schools. In this theoretical essay, we re-center the calls of 1960s Chicana/o Movement youth (and parents and educators) and argue that to realize their radical vision, bilingual education and educators must deliberately re-center and engage dialogically with contemporary Chicana/o/x and Latina/o/x bi/multilingual students’ critical assessments about their lived intersectional experiences with language, power, identities, and schooling. To this end, we propose what we call Bilingual Education for Self-determination against Oppression (BESO). We see contemporary Chicana/o/x and Latina/o/x bi/multilingual children and youth as uniquely positioned to advance radical forms of bilingual education, like the type envisioned by Chicana/o Movement youth activists. We conclude with implications for the realization of BESO in practice and policy.",1,0

"As Voloshinov has famously argued, ‘the word is the most sensitive index of social changes, and what is more, of changes still in the process of growth’ (Voloshinov, 1986: 19). Scrutiny of young people's discourses on language together with their language practices offers us a window into a society in transition, such as present-day South Africa. This article examines the language ideologies and language practices of Black youth attending previously White, now desegregated, suburban schools in South African cities, important spaces for the production of an expanding Black middle class (Soudien, 2004). Due to their resourcing during apartheid (both financial and human) previously White schools are aligned with quality education and perceived as strategic sites for the acquisition and maintenance of a prestige variety of South African English. This article looks at how mainly African girls (15–16 years) position themselves in relation to English, drawing on data collected using ethnographic approaches in four desegregated schools in South African cities: three in Johannesburg, Gauteng and one in Cape Town, Western Cape. The discussion focuses on two significant themes: English and the [re]production of race; and the place of English in young people's linguistic repertoires. My aim is to show how African youth in desegregated schools orient themselves to English and what their language ideologies and language practices might tell us about macro social processes, including the (re)constitution of race in South Africa. Schooling, as Bourdieu points out, is one of the most important sites for social reproduction and is thus also one of the key sites, ‘which imposes the legitimate forms of discourse and the idea that discourse should be recognised if and only if it conforms to the legitimate norms’ (Bourdieu, 1977: 650). However, co-present with processes of reproduction are practices that work to subvert and unsettle dominant discourses. Suburban desegregated schools are thus productive sites for the re-making of cultural practices (including language) and identities.",1,0

"Social work writing, often referred to as ‘recording’ or ‘paperwork’, is frequently the target of criticism in reviews and public media reporting. However, despite the many criticisms made and its significance in social work practice, little empirical research has been carried out on professional social work writing. This paper draws on findings from an ESRC-funded study in the UK to offer a baseline characterization of the nature and function of writing in contemporary social work. Drawing on text and ethnographic data, the paper foregrounds three key dimensions: the number of written texts, key textual functionalities and genres; the specific ways in which ‘text work’ constitutes everyday social work professional practice, using case studies from the domains of adults, children and mental health; and the concerns by social workers about the amount of time they are required to spend on writing. The baseline characterization provides empirical evidence for claims made about the increased bureaucratisation of social work practice, signalling contemporary social work as a ‘writing intensive’ profession which is at odds with social workers’ professional ‘imaginary’. The paper concludes by outlining the educational and policy implications of the baseline characterization and calls for debate about the nature of contemporary social work practice.",1,0

"Analysing Sign Language Poetry by Rachel Sutton-Spence with Paddy Ladd and Gillian Rudd. (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2005, 256 pp. Hardcover, $75, ISBN 1-40393-507-6) ""What makes a poem a poem, finally, is that it is unparaphrasable. There is no other way to say exactly this; it exists only in its own body of language, only in these words. I may try to explain it in other terms, but then some element of its life will always be missing."" —Doty, Still Life with Oysters and Lemon Through typography and photography, Analysing Sign Language Poetry attempts to analyze a form of poetry characterized by its impermanence. To interpret this poetry, Rachel Sutton-Spence works primarily from video recordings of poetry recitals, from virtual rather actual verses. Black-and-white stills from these recordings are used throughout the book to illustrate different aspects of sign language poetry. The ""talking hands"" format of this footage has drawbacks in that the contrast between the usually static lower body and the dynamism of the poet's hands and arms, which forms part of the overall effect of any performance, is lost. These video stills are [End Page 347] supplemented by an appendix that contains versions of the sign language poems in written English, versions that Sutton-Spence emphasizes must be understood as translations. They are in another language, fixed upon the page, static. They cannot be understood as equivalent to this poetry in its performance, this poetry in motion, with its energy and kinesis. Sign language poetry is, by nature, fleeting. The poetry can be planned, and preparations can be made, but the poem itself emerges only through its performance and endures for the length of that presentation. The sign language poem is a kind of illocutionary speech. It does what it says. It is not produced and then recited; rather, its recitation effects its production. It is in its performance. The end of the presentation marks the disappearance of the poem, and this makes the poetry difficult to analyze. The poems that are discussed here no longer exist. Sutton-Spence works with the traces that persist of gestures that have long since vanished. The book is a work of memory. Sutton-Spence's new book remembers past performances of poems and also contributes to the remembrance of the poets themselves. In particular, Analysing Sign Language Poetry focuses on the work of sign language poet Dorothy Miles. Miles was a political activist who fought with her hands to produce poetry that highlighted the injustices inflicted upon the Deaf community by a largely ignorant hearing world. Hers was a courageous voice. Miles, who committed suicide in 1993, was the foremost sign language poet of her generation. She composed poetry in both ASL and BSL. Sutton- Spence examines versions of Miles's work in both languages while also tracking the poet's development from early experiments with blended poems (which combine both English and ASL) to her later creations in pure sign language. Many of Miles's poems are concerned with Deaf politics—the tyranny of oralism and the trials of everyday existence in an unfair hearing world. Some of these works, like The Ugly Duckling and Walking down the Street, are discussed in the book. Miles is no longer here to recite these works, but Sutton-Spence's text provides them with an afterlife. In a different context, that of a boxing match, A. J. Liebling wrote that the memory of any match will eventually become ""an amalgam of what you thought you saw there, what you read in the papers you [End Page 348] saw, and what you saw in the films"" (2004, 49). Sign language poems are similar. While the physical event is ephemeral, its remembrance is mutable and lasting. Through its images and interpretations, Analysing Sign Language Poetry is immensely valuable in its contribution to the recollection of Miles's oeuvre. Miles would perhaps be pleased to know that her verses are central to a work that argues...",1,0
"Although this dictionary was not published by a well-established publishing
house, its quality and usefulness rival those of seasoned publishers in the field
of Khoesan studies, such as the dictionaries by Dickens (1994), Traill (1994) and
Haacke (2002). This fourth edition of Visser's Naro Dictionary is a medium-sized
dictionary of 240 pages, including 16 pages of appendices. The work is the
result of more than 10 years of lexical compilation which resulted in several
editions of the dictionary, each of which was an expanded version of the earlier
one. Thus, from a miniature version, it has grown into a sizeable high-quality
work, in spite of the compiler's modest observation in his introduction that it is

"En este estudio se investigan algunos tipos de inferencias logicas generadas espontaneamente por ninos en la tarea de producir narraciones a partir de un conjunto no linguistico de estimulos espacialmente contiguos y temporal y causalmente vinculados. Para este proposito se han examinado las relaciones causativas fisica y psicologica, motivacionales y posibilitantes, elaboradas para establecer coherencia local entre segmentos adyacentes de los discursos construidos. El corpus empleado comprende 144 relatos producidos por ninos argentinos y chilenos de 3 a 11 anos. Los resultados obtenidos muestran que la integracion de segmentos adyacentes se precisa, de preferencia, mediante inferencias motivacionales y de causalidad psicologica y, en menor grado, por las de causalidad fisica (especialmente en el caso de los sujetos de 3 y 4 anos) y posibilitantes.",1,0

"This paper develops an account of mood selection with attitude predicates in French. I start by examining the “contextual commitment” account of mood developed by Portner and Rubinstein (in: Chereches (ed) Proceedings of SALT 22, CLC Publications, Ithaca, NY, pp 461–487, 2012). A key innovation of Portner and Rubinstein’s (PR and there are subjunctive-selecting predicates that involve no less contextual commitment (in P&R’s sense) than certain indicative-selecting verbs. I develop an alternative account of verbal mood. The general approach, which I call a state-of-mind approach, is to analyze mood in terms of whether the formal relation between the predicate’s modal backgrounds and an overall state of mind represents a relation of commitment. Indicative mood in French presupposes that the informational-evaluative state determined by the predicate’s modal backgrounds is included in the informational-evaluative state characterizing the event described by the predicate. The account provides an improved explanation of core mood-selection puzzles, including subjunctive-selection with emotive factives, indicative-selection with fiction verbs, indicative-selection with esperer ‘hope’ versus subjunctive-selection with vouloir ‘want’, and indicative-selection with commissives versus subjunctive-selection with directives. Subjunctive-selection with modal adjectives is briefly considered. The mood-selection properties of the predicates are derived from the proposed analysis of mood, independently attested features of the predicates’ semantics, and general principles of interpretation.",1,0
"Academic journals are a site of tension between the perspective of the transnational and international – between an emphasis on the agency and creativity of linguistic practice that transcends boundaries of nations and languages and a focus on the enduring relations of colonial capitalism that impose bounded and hierarchized order upon our social and linguistic life. Being an international journal in transnational times comes with the challenge of having to facilitate transnational flows of knowledge without reifying the oppressive structure of the political economy of knowledge production. The International Journal of the Sociology of Language’s response to this challenge may lie in its commitment to solidarity and collaboration, where it serves as a ground for resisting the pressures of academic capitalism and for collectively seeking an agenda for research which dismantle hierarchies and boundaries that sustain and rationalize inequalities.",1,0

"Historical linguistics is a field that, perhaps more than other branches of linguistics, can be said to exhibit a certain conservatism. To be clear, this term is not meant in any traditional political sense. Rather it is meant to capture the notion that, as a discipline, diachronic studies seem to accept and build on previous theories and empirical findings to a greater extent than do most synchronic subdisciplines. This may be because data are comparatively rare and hard to come by. One result of this scarcity is that, once analyzed, there are fewer opportunities for reanalysis predicated on new data. There are, of course, occasions when more or less radical proposals are brought forward subsequently, which result in debates of the kind which are much more common in synchronic syntax, say, or phonology. The reconstruction of the Indo-European consonant system (Beekes 1995: 132–4 provides a summary), for example, continues to be debated almost two hundred years after it was first proposed.",1,0

"Aboriginal people involved in the criminal justice system in the Northern Territory of Australia are disadvantaged because of the lack of court-trained interpreters, and because of cultural differences which affect their ability to understand and be understood. Aboriginal people speak a variety of languages as well as a form of English which differs from standard English. The article examines efforts made to establish an Aboriginal Languages Interpreter Service, and to establish methods which can be employed by the courts to reduce the effect of these difficulties in the investigative and trial processes. It is recommended that translations in the main Aboriginal languages of the caution and other relevant information be tape-recorded and played by the police to Aboriginal suspects before commencing a formal record of interview, and that judges should insist on the presence of trained interpreters during the recording of interview, in addition to a prisoner's friend, unless good reasons are shown. The different roles of prisoners' friends and interpreters is discussed. It is recommended that trained interpreters be used wherever possible even if the witnesses are largely able to be understood by English-speaking jurors. The article also discusses ways in which police, counsel and judges can more fairly elicit relevant information from Aboriginal people or from people of mixed descent in the English language. It is recommended that trial judges should give suitable direction to juries before the witnesses are called, drawing attention to the main areas where misunderstandings may occur, that judges need to be more pro-active to prevent forms of advocacy likely to operate unfairly to Aboriginal people, and that prosecutors need to ensure juries are informed of the relationships between the victim, witnesses and accused, as well as other relevant cultural information. The article discusses ways in which this can be achieved, and reflects upon changes which have emerged in the criminal justice system since the employment of these techniques began to be used in the mid 1990s.",1,0

"Abstract Valid and reliable measurements of response latency are crucial in testing empirical predictions across fields of psychology. In research utilizing verbal responses, acoustic latency is the typical measure of response latency, but its validity has been questioned. We describe a simple and affordable alternative – articulatory latency based on tracking lip position. Using this method, we measured the acoustic and articulatory latencies of syllables beginning with various simple and complex onsets and ending with “uh” using the speeded naming task, where participants were instructed to have their mouths either closed or open before articulating. The initial oral configuration, place of articulation, and voicing all had significant effects on this measure of articulatory latency across segments, factors that researchers must consider in designing experiments and selecting stimuli.",1,0

"Patient-centredness in audiological rehabilitation has previously been presented as possible only when attending to psychosocial aspects of hearing loss. Yet, audiologists routinely and by necessity provide technologically orientated advice about hearing aids. Although some advice is resisted, a significant number of patients are assisted and have improved quality of life because of audiological advice. This study investigates moments of advice giving during audiology consultations, in which hearing aids were discussed as rehabilitative options. Two illustrative cases selected from a collection of 20 consultations are presented, in which the audiologists' goals differed from those of the patients, but where after a process of advising (in one case offering explicit advice and in the other implicit advice), rehabilitation including hearing aids was agreed to. Hypothetical questions, voicing and patterns of pronoun use provided evidence of patient-centredness, in the absence of an obvious psychosocial focus. Demonstrating patient-centredness in discussions about hearing aids provides additional perspectives on current public commentary about the sale of hearing aids by audiologists. Additionally, demonstrating patient-centredness during hearing aid discussions suggests that audiologists may be able to transfer their skills to address areas commonly neglected in audiology consultations, including a focus on psychosocial aspects of audiological care.",1,0

"In this introduction to this special issue of the Journal of Phonetics, the concept of generalization of scientific explanations across normal individuals and individuals with identified clinical disorders that affect speech production and perception is discussed. Papers dealing with speech production in persons with hearing impairment, aphasia, dysarthria, voice disorders, and structural modifications of the vocal tract, as well as simulations of hearing loss and lexicons show how data from speech and hearing disorders may inform theory about normal processes. In this context, clinical disorders are seen as opportunities for basic scientific research. Associated with these opportunities are potential pitfalls for scientific experimental design. Chief among such pitfalls is the loss of randomized selection of individuals for experimental study. The effect of this problem on experimental design is discussed along with some suggestions for alternative research designs and methods for incorporating results from clinical disorders in basic scientific explanations.",1,0

The first two co-editors (Ji Young Shim and Tabea Ihsane) worked on the research project entitled Selection at the Interfaces, in which various linguistic aspects (e.g., syntactic structure, interface with semantics, etc.) of clausal and nominal complements in monolingual grammars were explored.1 To extend an investigation of these issues to bilingual contexts, they organized a two-day workshop entitled Clausal and Nominal Complements in Monolingual and Bilingual Grammars in June 2016, where the third co-editor (M. Carmen Parafita Couto) of this Special Issue was an invited speaker.2 The workshop aimed to investigate the left periphery of complements, in particular the left periphery of the clause and the nominal phrase and its edge, such as C(omplementizers) and D(eterminer) and other top-most functional layers, where languages may be parametrized differently, thus leading to linguistic variation.Within generative grammar, it has long been assumed that language variation is due to variation in the domain of functional categories and their morpho-syntactic properties [1,2]. Following this tradition, the left periphery of the clause has been extensively investigated, confirming the hypothesis that the functional category C(omplementizer) and its morpho-syntactic properties may be parameterized differently across languages within research on monolingual grammar [3,4,5,6]. In addition, the left periphery of a nominal phrase has also been investigated to a great extent [7,8,9], based on the proposal that clauses and nominal phrases have parallel structures ([10] and in subsequent work).In recent years, generative linguists have also started to pay attention to the left periphery of bilingual grammars, especially in relation to diverse patterns of code-switching, which is the mixed use of two or more languages in conversation, and which is frequently observed in bilingual speech. Under the assumption that monolingual and bilingual grammars are subject to the same grammatical principles [11,12,13,14], several researchers have investigated the grammar of code-switching in various language pairs and showed that the left periphery of a particular functional category such as C, D, or v may be parameterized differently across languages and derive certain patterns of code-switching, which confirm the validity of the linguistic proposals that are put forth to account for monolingual grammars [15,16,17].While the workshop Clausal and Nominal Complements in Monolingual and Bilingual Grammars motivated us to edit the current Special Issue with the same title, it is important to note that the present volume is not a report on the proceedings of the workshop. A separate call for papers for this volume was made through Languages. The Special Issue Clausal and Nominal Complements in Monolingual and Bilingual Grammars comprises seven articles in total, which are theory-oriented and/or empirically based in nature. These articles collectively investigate one of the key theoretical issues that generative linguists have pursued for a long time: how languages are encoded similarly or differently. In so doing, three articles concentrate on nominal complements and clausal complements in monolingual grammars [18,19,20], and four articles focus on nominal and clausal complements in bilingual grammars [21,22,23,24].For monolingual contexts, Christopher Laenzlinger compares the structure of clauses (Complementizer Phrases; CPs) and noun/determiner phrases (DPs) [18]. Working in the cartographic approach to the Generative Grammar framework, he reconsiders so-called clause/noun-phrase (non-)parallelism in terms of structure and derivation. Although he assumes that both clauses and nominal phrases have a similar structure, which is divided into three domains—the Nachfeld (‘right periphery’), the Mittelfeld (‘midfield’) and the Vorfeld (‘left periphery’)—he argues that the inner structures of clauses and noun phrases are not strictly parallel, and in particular the left periphery of a clause is richer and more developed than that of a noun phrase. As a result, despite the similar possible types of movement occurring both in the CP and the DP domains (head movement and phrasal movement), there still exists non-parallelism in CPs and DPs in the application of these types of movement. To support the existence of non-parallelism between clauses and nominal phrases, Laenzlinger shows the respective orders of various elements such as adverbs/adjectives, DP/Prepositional Phrase (PP)-arguments and DP/PP-adjuncts in French in comparison with many other languages.In addition to Laenzlinger’s analysis [18], two more papers focus on the structure of clausal complements in monolingual grammars. Marcel den Dikken [19] revisits Chomsky’s two earlier approaches to account for the structure of clausal complements of verbs—a preform analysis [25] and a direct clausal embedding analysis [26], the latter of which has replaced the former and has become the generalized view in generative syntax. By comparing factive and non-factive clausal complements in Dutch and Hungarian, particularly the relative position of the verb vis-à-vis the clausal complement in Dutch and the co-occurrence of a proleptic noun with the clausal complement in Hungarian, den Dikken proposes that there are two structural positions for the object of verbs, the usual complement of the verb position and a specifier of VP (or a higher node). While the direct clausal embedding analysis accounts for the complement position of the object, it is the preform analysis (with a small modification) that can explain the specifier position of the object in these two languages. Den Dikken further builds up his proposal into analyzing wh-scope marking and wh-dependencies in Hungarian and German.The distinction between factive and non-factive clausal complements is also discussed in detail by Ji Young Shim and Tabea Ihsane [20]. They investigate clausal complements of factive and non-factive predicates in English, with particular focus on the distribution of overt and null that complementizers. To account for several differences between factive and non-factive clausal complements, including the distribution of the overt and null complementizers, they propose that overt that clauses and null that clauses have different underlying structures responsible for their different syntactic behavior. Adopting Rizzi’s split CP structure with two C heads, Force and Finiteness [3], Shim and Ihsane suggest that null that clauses are FinPs (Finiteness Phrases) under both factive and non-factive predicates, whereas overt that clauses have an extra functional layer above FinP, lexicalizing either the head Force under non-factive predicates or the light demonstrative head d under factive predicates. The authors argue that this analysis further provides an explanation for the distribution of overt that clauses and null that clauses outside sentential complements, such as sentential subjects.The interim conclusion of the papers by Laenzlinger [18], den Dikken [19] and Shim and Ihsane [20], which are based on the monolingual grammar of diverse languages, suggest that, despite the widely assumed structural parallelism between clauses and nominals, the clausal left periphery is more complex than the nominal left periphery, and the inner structure of the clausal left periphery also varies depending on its selection of predicates, such as factivity. Thus, to understand the precise nature of clausal and nominal left peripheries, we must also consider their interface with semantics and the lexical items that comprise them.As for bilingual contexts, Robert-Tissot and Morel [21] use a Swiss corpus of code-switching text messages to test two principles proposed by González Vilbazo [27]: (i) the Principle of Functional Restriction (i.e., two functional heads X° and Y° have to be filled by lexical material of the same language if the functional category of YP is the complement of X° and both heads are part of the same extended projection); and (ii) the Principle of Agreement (i.e., inside a phrase, agreement requirements have to be satisfied, regardless of the language providing the lexical material). They discuss specific examples that mostly confirm the validity of the principles, showing the structured nature of code-switching as well as contributing to the growing consensus that it is possible to predict the nature of grammatical and ungrammatical code- switched sequences.In their article, López et al. [22] show how the theoretical construct “phase” can be used to account for a number of restrictions on code-switching, in particular those formalized under the Principle of Functional Restriction [27] and the Phonetic Form Interface Condition [28]. López et al. postulate the Block Transfer Hypothesis (BTH), stating that the material that is transferred to the interfaces within a phase is transferred in one block. It follows from the BTH that code-switching may take place at phase boundaries but not within the phase. They further posit that phases are empirically superior in scope, as they can explain code-switching phenomena not explained by previous accounts (e.g., switches between C and TP, progressive aspect, and switching within the word level). The authors take this as reinforcement for the fundamental hypothesis that code-switching should be studied using the same tools that we use for monolingual data, and suggest that phase theory, together with distributed morphology, may be the way forward.In both studies (one by Robert-Tissot and Morel [21] and the other by López et al. [22]), the validity of the Principle of Functional Restriction (PFR) is tested. The PFR prohibits code-switching between two functional heads belonging in the same extended projection. Thus, it predicts that code-switching cannot occur in the left periphery of a nominal phrase (e.g., between a D(eterminer) and a Q(uantifier) and also in the left periphery of a clause (e.g., between a C(omplementizer) and T(ense)). However, both studies found counter-examples that allow code-switching in the left periphery of nominal and clausal domains. For instance, a switch may occur between a D (Italian) and a Q (French) [21] and between a C (Spanish) and T (German) if Spec C is not empty [22]. To account for these examples, Robert-Tissot and Morel resort to a non-structural account, whereas López et al. offer a phase-based syntactic analysis.The left periphery of noun phrases in bilingual contexts is explored in two papers in this volume. In her contribution [23], Brita Ramsevik Riksem investigates the heritage language American Norwegian and provides a diachronic study of language-mixing within noun phrases, that is, the occurrence of English items in American Norwegian. By comparing data collected in the 1930s and 1940s with recently collected data, she shows that the overall pattern of language-mixing is stable but some systematic diachronic changes are attested, specifically concerning the categories of number and definiteness. These changes consist of the omission of functional exponents and usage of English functional exponents, such as the plural suffix -s and the determiner the. She proposes two potential analyses of these patterns based on an exoskeletal approach to grammar, and a theoretical framework that separates abstract syntactic structure from its phonological exponents. These analyses consider both the structure and the exponents as the origins of the change. However, on the basis of the observed patterns of change, Riksem argues that a structural reanalysis of American Norwegian grammar is occurring.Finally, Blokzijl et al. explore the factors that influence the language of determiners in mixed nominal constructions in two bilingual corpora (Spanish-English speakers in Miami (USA), and Spanish-English creole speakers in Nicaragua) [24]. The results of their comparative analysis indicate that the language of the determiner matches the matrix language. Crucially, this match between the language of the determiner and the matrix language seems to be unaffected by any grammaticized features in the determiner, which is unlike that which has been previously argued [29]. Additionally, they found that the frequency of switching from the determiner to the noun was asymmetric in the Miami data, being more frequent from Spanish to English in the Miami data. In the Nicaragua data, on the other hand, they only observed switches from English creole to Spanish. These findings call into question the assumption that the same code-switching patterns surface in different bilingual communities, suggesting that we need to examine the interplay between social and grammatical factors more meticulously.Overall, this Special Issue provides a timely collection of articles that discuss clausal and nominal complements in monolingual and bilingual grammars, especially in the form of code-switching. As evidenced by several papers in this collection, the inner structure of clausal and nominal edges differs from language to language and it further affects patterns of code-switching. We hope that the papers in this Special Issue will generate keen interest in this topic and offer a basis for further research on other related topics. In particular, more work needs to be conducted to examine diachronic structural changes in bilingual grammars and syntactic variation in bi/multilingual contexts involving lesser-studied languages such as Creoles (e.g., Nicaragua, Belize, Cape Verde, etc.; see, for instance, the volume edited by Sessarego [30]). This direction of research will have much to tell us about linguistic variation across time and space. AcknowledgmentsWe thank all authors who contributed to this Special Issue and the reviewers of the manuscripts. Also we extend our thanks to the Editors of Languages (Osmer Balam and Usha Lakshmanan) and the editorial office for their support and patience to take a long journey with us. Without them, this Special Issue could not have been brought out. We hope that the seven papers included in this collection will provide readers with a deeper understanding of the structure of language and further their interest in the topic of clausal and nominal complements in monolingual and bilingual grammars.Author ContributionsJi Young Shim, Tabea Ihsane, and M.

"Communicating via text-only computer-mediated communication (CMC) channels is associated with a number of issues that would impair users in achieving dialogue coherence and goals. It has been suggested that humans have devised novel adaptive strategies to deal with those issues. However, it could be that humans rely on “classic” coherence devices too. In this study, we investigate whether relevancy markers, a subset of discourse markers, are relied on to assess dialogue coherence and goals. The results of two experiments showed that participants oriented systematically on the relevancy markers and that substitution of the original markers for other (dis)similar words affected eye movements and task performance. It appears that, despite the loosely connected dialogue contributions, the multiple concurrent dialogues, and the multiparty nature of text-only CMC dialogues, humans are able still to locate coherence- and goal-related information by relying on the presence of the relevancy markers.",1,0

"ABSTRACT This article introduces, illustrates, and discusses a method for measuring the attrition of communicative competence using data from spontaneous, freestyle, multiperson conversations. The illustration is based on speech production data of Spanish L3 subjects' from Ghana. The method involves the creation of a multiple-factor (composite) index using defined temporal variables, frequency counts of selected verbal behaviors, and grammatical information; it can be used to measure either the rate of attrition or its reverse, which, for lack of a better term, is called the “accumulation of competence.”",1,0

"The Journal of African Languages and Linguistics ( JALL ) was founded in 1979 at the University of Leiden, with Paul Newman as Editor and Thilo Schadeberg as Associate Editor. Foris Publications was the initial publisher. Motivation for launching a new journal came from the fact that whereas African linguistics in the 1970s was thriving, many of the extant African linguistics journals were floundering. From its inception, JALL was conceived of as a broad-based journal of truly international scope. The intellectual underpinnings of JALL can be found in the original editorial statement, reproduced here, and in the work of three major scholars who were closely associated with African linguistics at Leiden, namely Jan Voorhoeve, with his focus on tone, Kay Williamson, with her dedication to on-site fieldwork, and John Stewart, with his emphasis on solid historical linguistics. The scientific principle that underlay JALL at the outset and continued throughout its thirty-year history was a commitment to sophisticated, theoretically-informed empiricism.",1,0

Mais il en est de meme en toute question. Sauf qu'ici, sans doute, les roles attendus sont inverses. La subjectivite, c'est, d'avance, semble-til, le mauvais role, le trouble-fete qui vient deregler les jeux ordonnes de l'objectivite. Role qu'elle joue d'ailleurs, mais si bien et si vite qu'en verite tout bascule et qu'elle se voit promue a la reconnaissance indiscutee et a l'exercice de la fonction de reference. Refuser d'en reciter les merites, est-ce pour autant rehabiliter son double adverse et revenir ainsi a la situation qui prevalait avant le renversement des places ?

"Abstract This paper explores a possible chain shift in Gujarati dialects, involving the consonants k , kh , c , ch , s , ś , h , ḥ , V̤ , and ∅ (where ś denotes IPA [ʃ], ḥ voiceless [h], V̤ a murmured vowel, and ∅ “zero”). The chain shift can be discerned by comparing the colloquial forms in the regional dialects with the standard Gujarati forms and those of Central Indo-Aryan languages like Hindi. This comparison yields the following correspondences, giving the standard and Central Indo-Aryan sounds first: k, kh = c, ch ; c, ch = s or ś ; s = ḥ ; h = V̤ or ∅ . The paper demonstrates that this set of correspondences between standard Gujarati and the dialects is a large one, and that it indeed suggests a chain shift, taken up differentially in the various dialects analyzed (Kathiawadi, Surti, Charotari, and Pattani). For the chain shift, the standard is firmly in the Central Indo-Aryan camp, while the dialects analyzed align more closely with Western Indo-Aryan.",1,0

"Una integración eficiente de un sistema de traducción automática (TA) en un flujo de traducción conlleva la necesidad de distinguir entre oraciones que se benefician de la TA y las que no antes de que pasen a manos del traductor. En este trabajo, cuestionamos el uso por separado de las dimensiones de esfuerzo de posedición de Krings (2001) para clasificar oraciones en aptas para traducir o poseditar al entrenar modelos de predicción y abogamos por una estrategia multidimensional. A partir de una tarea de posedición en un escenario real, se recogen mediciones de los tres parámetros de esfuerzo, a saber, tiempo, tasa de palabras poseditadas, y percepción del esfuerzo, como representativos de las tres dimensiones (temporal, técnica y cognitiva). Los resultados muestran que, a pesar de que existen correlaciones entre las mediciones, los parámetros difieren en la clasificación de un número elevado de oraciones. Concluimos que la estrategia multidimensional es necesaria para estimar el esfuerzo real de posedición.",1,0

語言學家對古漢語中介詞短語的句法特點有不同的看法。有的認為古漢語中的介詞短語大都是在動詞的後面，但也有人持反對意見。本人支持後者的觀點。事實上古漢語中的介詞短語用在動詞前後均可。在應用上，動詞前和動詞後介詞短語的使用頻率似乎是不相上下。在古文中，“以”字有時用在動詞前，有時用在動詞後，在動詞前的，有時還是後置詞。有不少例子顯示“以”字的用法可能是有一定規律的。動詞前的和動詞後的“以”字句可能是和上下文的話語結構有關。動詞前“以”字後的名詞一般都較動詞後“以”字後的名詞較接近它的先行詞“antecedent＂。至於“以”字後置詞的用法則可能是因上古語法的演變而造成的。漢語的詞序可能是從漢藏語的主賓謂演變成主謂賓。所以，古漢語中的後置詞用法可能是古漢藏語語法的痕跡。,1,0

"Un double statut d’étudiant et d’expert caractérise la situation du stagiaire. Posant l’hypothèse que la tension qui s’exerce entre ces deux statuts est repérable dans le discours, nous avons analysé, dans une perspective interactionniste, le discours de deux stagiaires sages-femmes québécoises lors de consultations de suivi prénatal. Un double rapport au savoir acquis et à transmettre apparait, qui est étroitement lié à l’histoire récente de la profession de sage-femme au Québec. Les sages-femmes québécoises fondent leur identité professionnelle sur un ensemble de valeurs distinctives, parmi lesquelles le partage du savoir médical avec la cliente occupe une grande place. L’analyse montre l’adhésion de la stagiaire à cette valeur ; en cela, elle est déjà sage-femme. Mais le partage du savoir suppose une évaluation de la pertinence des informations à transmettre. Sur ce plan, la stagiaire reste une étudiante et doit encore acquérir un élément important de l’expertise : la souplesse dans le maniement de ce savoir.",1,0

"I explore some relationships between metonymy and a special type of hyperbole that I call reflexive hyperbole . Reflexive hyperbole provides a unified, simple explanation of certain natural meanings of statements such as the following: Sailing is Mary’s life, The undersea sculptures became the ocean, When Sally watched the film she became James Bond, I am Charlie Hebdo, John is Hitler, The internet is cocaine and I am Amsterdam . The meanings, while of seemingly disparate types, are deeply united: they are all hyperbolic about some contextually salient relationship that has a special property that I call “broad reflexivity.” Although a few of the types of meaning of interest have metonymic aspects (or metaphorical aspects), reflexive hyperbole cannot just be explained by a straightforward application of metonymy theory (or metaphor theory). Indeed, I argue instead for a dependency in the converse direction: that much and perhaps even all metonymy is rooted – if sometimes slightly indirectly – in broadly reflexive relationships, though not usually in a hyperbolic way.",1,0

En me fondant sur un corpus constitue d'oeuvres de Plaute, de Terence, de Ciceron et de Petrone, j'essaierai de proposer une typologie des constituants disloques a droite. Ces derniers se distinguent par certaines proprietes: coreferentiels avec un terme (nom ou pronom), enonce au prealable, ils fournissent une specification de son contenu (generiquespecifique) ou apportent des evaluations subjectives d'un contenu. Les constituants disloques a droite remplissent une fonction pragmatique particuliere en specifiant, a posteriori, un terme enonce au prealable. Cependant, ils ne se definissent pas par le placement en fin de phrase: un constituant en position finale n'est pas necessairement «disloque a droite».",1,0

"Review of current diagnostic and assessment methods for depression and suicidality.Review the characteristics of active depressed and suicidal speech databases.Discuss the effects of depression and suicidality on common speech characteristics.Review of studies that use speech to classify or predict depression or suicidality.Discuss future challenges in finding a speech-based markers of either condition. This paper is the first review into the automatic analysis of speech for use as an objective predictor of depression and suicidality. Both conditions are major public health concerns; depression has long been recognised as a prominent cause of disability and burden worldwide, whilst suicide is a misunderstood and complex course of death that strongly impacts the quality of life and mental health of the families and communities left behind. Despite this prevalence the diagnosis of depression and assessment of suicide risk, due to their complex clinical characterisations, are difficult tasks, nominally achieved by the categorical assessment of a set of specific symptoms. However many of the key symptoms of either condition, such as altered mood and motivation, are not physical in nature; therefore assigning a categorical score to them introduces a range of subjective biases to the diagnostic procedure. Due to these difficulties, research into finding a set of biological, physiological and behavioural markers to aid clinical assessment is gaining in popularity. This review starts by building the case for speech to be considered a key objective marker for both conditions; reviewing current diagnostic and assessment methods for depression and suicidality including key non-speech biological, physiological and behavioural markers and highlighting the expected cognitive and physiological changes associated with both conditions which affect speech production. We then review the key characteristics; size, associated clinical scores and collection paradigm, of active depressed and suicidal speech databases. The main focus of this paper is on how common paralinguistic speech characteristics are affected by depression and suicidality and the application of this information in classification and prediction systems. The paper concludes with an in-depth discussion on the key challenges - improving the generalisability through greater research collaboration and increased standardisation of data collection, and the mitigating unwanted sources of variability - that will shape the future research directions of this rapidly growing field of speech processing research.",1,0

"La notion de grammaticalisation par laquelle on renvoie a un proces dynamique au terme duquel certains elements lexicaux en arrivent a remplir un role grammatical couvre une realite tellement complexe qu'elle demande a etre decomposee en un ensemble de phenomenes distincts, mais operant en interaction. Cette contribution analyse tout d'abord la grammaticalisation en tant que processus et s'interroge a la fois sur les processus semantico-pragmatiques de type paradigmatique, centres autour de la desemantisation, et sur les processus formels syntagmatiques, lies a la morphologisation. Force nous est de constater que tous ces processus sont typiques, mais non pas specifiques de la grammaticalisation. L'examen de la grammaticalisation en tant que resultat pose ensuite le probleme de la definition du domaine grammatical et revele la frontiere instable entre la grammaticalisation et la lexicalisation. Il conviendrait finalement de distinguer la grammaticalisation qui opere au niveau intraphrastique et la «discursivisation» qui se situe sur le plan interphrastique",1,0

"We deal with the origins of the Germanic preterite presents within the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) verb system, highlighting the problems encountered when linking these verbs to existing PIE categories. We argue for the existence of a PIE ‘derived stative’ verb category formed by adding stative inflections to eventive (aorist) roots. Morphologically this category resembles the PIE perfect, but it is unreduplicated; semantically, it denotes a pure state, not a resultant state. This category may be the origin of most of the fifteen Germanic preterite presents. The derived stative category may also be seen as the missing link between the PIE root stative and the PIE perfect.",1,0

II nous semble que l'alternance codique devient une stratégie pédagogique surtout dans les leçons où les professeurs traitent un point grammatical. Nous avons choisi de nous concentrer sur l'enseignement du passé composé par ces trois professeurs, car ce temps verbal présente des problèmes pour les apprenants australiens. L'étude montre que l'alternance codique intersententielle pourrait aider les apprenants, mais que l'alternance intrasententielle leur donnerait l'idée que ce temps verbal fonctionne de la même façon dans les deux langues. Chez ces trois professeurs, l'alternance codique fonctionne comme un troisième code dans la salle de classe, l'équivalent de l'anglais et du français.",1,0

"Dans le présent article, je tenterai de montrer que la recherche qualitative de type ethnographique constitue un outil des plus ap-propriés pour étudier le processus de construction identitaire et les pratiques langagières, en ce qu'elle se prête à l'analyse microsociologique. L'ethno-graphie permet en effet de mettre en lumière la complexité du processus de construction identitaire et des pratiques langagières qui s'y rattachent. Contrairement au courant positiviste de recherche qui privilégie davantage les études à grande échelle et l'expérimentation, elle s'intéresse aux expériences de vie quotidienne des individus et permet ainsi de mieux comprendre les pratiques sociales existantes. C'est à partir du discours des individus engagés dans ces pratiques que l'analyse s'effectue. Dans le but de démontrer la pertinence de cette approche méthodologique, je présenterai une étude ethnographique menée entre 1997 et 2000 auprès d'un groupe d'adolescents et d'adolescentes fréquentant l'école secondaire de langue française en Ontario. L'étude portait sur la façon dont se positionnent ces jeunes en ce qui a trait à l'identité.

"This section investigates the syntactic licensing conditions for GoN and offers a (partial) solution. The discussion is necessarily brief and somewhat simplified. In a derivational model of syntax such as Chomsky's Minimalism, two questions need to be addressed to gain a minimal understanding of any process: (i) When does it happen? and (ii) What are its locality conditions? These questions are addressed for GoN in the following two subsections. The question of timing turns out to be crucial to the account of EN developed in section 4 of the paper. The question concerning locality turns out to be less central for EN. I try to unify the locality condition regulating GoN with Relativized Minimality (Rizzi 1990). (30) I will simply leave aside certain other important questions concerning GoN. For example, I have nothing new to say about the optionality of GoN (for which see Bailyn 1995, 1997 and references cited there). I also have little to add to the debate about the function of GoN as a semantic marker (see Babby 1980; Bailyn 1995, 1997; Borschev and Partee 1998; Brown 1999b; Partee and Borschev 2000, 2001, 2002 and the many references cited there). 3.1 Locality Following work by Franks (1995) and Neidle (1988), I assume that the following generalization is essentially correct. GoN is licensed with clause-mate negation (39); it is licensed in the complement of subject control verbs (40, 41); it is not licensed long distance in embedded non-finite interrogatives (42), in finite clauses (43), or in the complement of object control verbs (44). (31) (39) [check]Ivan ne citaet zurnala. Ivan NEG reads [journal.sub.GON] 'Ivan doesn't read the journal/a journal.' (40) [check]Natasa ne xotela citat' knig. Natasa NEG wanted to-read [books.sub.GoN.PL] 'Natasha didn't want to read any books.' (41) [check]Ja ne poobescala Natase citat' I NEG promised [Natasa.sub.DAT] to-read knig. [book.sub.GON.PL] 'I didn't promise Natasha to read any books.' (42) *Ja ne pomnju kak pisat' stixov. I NEG remember how to-write [poems.sub.GEN.PL] 'I don't remember how to write poems.' (Brown and Franks 1995: 254 ex. 227b) (43) *Ivan ne skazal, cto on citaet zurnala. Ivan NEG said that he reads [journal.sub.GON] 'Ivan didn't say that he reads the journal/a journal.' (44) *Ja ne ugovorila Natasu citat' knig. I NEG persuaded [Natasa.sub.ACC] to-read [books.sub.GoN] intended: 'I didn't persuade Natasha to read books.' An additional generalization, mentioned in section 1, is that only underlying internal arguments can ever appear in the genitive of negation (4). Only one instance of GoN is licensed per negation (45) (see Brown and Franks (1995) from where the example is taken). (32,33) Finally, GoN and structural accusative are never both licensed by the same verbal predicate (46, 47). GoN and structural accusative are in complementary distribution: if GoN is assigned by a verbal predicate, then structural accusative is not, and if structural accusative is assigned by a verbal predicate, then GoN is not. (45) Oni i uznavat' drug o drupe [check]novosti/ they even to-find-out each about other [news.sub.ACC] *novostej ne imeli prava. [news.sub.GoN] NEG had [right.sub.GON] 'They didn't even have the right to find out news about each other.' (46) *Svety ne citaet zurnal. [Sveta.sub.GoN] NEG read [journal.sub.ACC] intended: 'Sveta doesn't read a/the journal.' (47) *Svetu ne citaet zurnala. [Sveta.sub.ACC] NEG read [journal.sub.GON] intended: 'Sveta doesn't read a/the journal.' I account for the fact that no verb ever assigns GoN and accusative in the same clause by assuming (following Brown and Franks 1995: 247) that GoN and accusative are assigned from the same position. …",1,0

抽象 本文在地域上將粵東潮陽地區分為郊區與中心區，基於陰上調的讀音差異，將發音人區分為老派和新派，通過詳細考察這「兩區四派」共81位發音人的聲調材料，發現該地區的聲調在地域及年齡上的共時變異可用兩條鏈式演化加以解釋：一是陰上調的槽形鏈移，陰上由高緩降演變為高平（或中平），繼而演變為微升（或高升）；二是陰上、陽去、陰平參與的拉鏈鏈移，該鏈移由陰上的變化啟動，利用聲調的人際差異可確定聲調的演化方向。本文還以潮陽郊區方言23位老派發音人為例，分析其聲調系統中四個降調的對立實質，發現斜率是兩個高降調（高緩降與高直降）的最主要的區別特徵，時長則是重要的伴隨特徵。潮陽地區四降調系統的演化過程體現了漢語方言聲調發展的一個趨勢，即朝著曲拱對立更為豐富的格局發展。,1,0

"The paper investigates the origin, the development, the semantics and the pragmatics of the temporal use of the Dutch expression goed en wel ‘good and well’. We argue that the expression has developed from a meaning “safe and sound” into an indicator of the end of a preparatory phase or transition period, as well as a marker of the beginning of a new state. We observe that temporal goed en wel always requires a secondary state of affairs that is temporally related to the transition point initiating the primary state of affairs, and we show that the expression is increasingly being employed for rhetorical purposes.",1,0

"Empirical study of dictionary use is now almost one hundred years old, if we count Grinstead (1915) as the first paper in this category. Obviously, a larger part of the long period saw very little research activity, as the majority of the empirical user studies available today have been done in the last two decades or so (for a recent survey, see Welker 2010). Several authors have pointed out the methodological shortcomings of some of those studies (e.g. Hulstijn and Atkins 1998; Dolezal and McCreary 1999; Humble 2001; Lew 2004; Tarp 2009), but there is no denying that the methodological standards are improving at a steady rate. International Journal of Lexicography has given some attention to empirical user studies. Over the last ten years, eleven such articles can be identified; however, as many as four of these have been published in the last two years (Chon 2009; Lew and Doroszewska 2009; Chen 2010; Dziemianko 2010). This could suggest that interest in this strand of research is on the rise, and so it was thought that the lexicographic community would welcome a collection of reports on original user studies presented under a single cover. As a result of an effort to produce such a collection, the present issue includes six state-of-the-art contributions. Most experts now agree that dictionaries should be compiled with the users’ needs foremost in mind. We are also now well aware of how varied those needs can be. In view of this, it is surprising that very few studies actually address this point directly and in sufficient detail. The first paper in this volume, Do dictionaries define on the level of their target users? A case study for three Dutch dictionaries, written by Gilles-Maurice de Schryver and Danie Prinsloo, provides a model for such investigations. The authors examine whether three different definition formats as used in three Van Dale dictionaries for native speakers of three different age brackets really work best for users of the intended age range. The answer is a qualified no. It appears that the publisher has systematically overestimated the metalinguistic skills of the users at just about any age. Collocation is an area that has long been neglected by lexicography and language learning alike. Batia Laufer’s piece (The contribution of dictionary use to the production and retention of collocations in a second language) looks at collocation from both these angles by examining the use and acquisition of International Journal of Lexicography, Vol. 24 No. 1, 2011, pp. 1–4 doi:10.1093/ijl/ecq044 Advance access publication 27 January 2011 1",1,0

"Abstract Ethical misbehavior in the delivery of healthcare creates harm not only to individual therapists and administrators who might choose to overstep ethical boundaries but also, more broadly, causes harm to patients, to healthcare organizations, to professional organizations, and ultimately to society. Both corporate codes of conduct and professional codes of ethics are important, because they set standards of conduct and penalize noncompliant or unethical conduct. The purposes of this article are (1) to differentiate corporate compliance from ethics in a healthcare organization; (2) to explain the application of ethics principles to organizational and professional behaviors; (3) to discuss three important ethical issues (cultural competence, conflict of interest, and employer demands); and (4) to emphasize that, whether applying a corporate code of conduct or a professional code of ethics (or both), the integrity of each individual is essential to ethical behavior. To illustrate these concepts, ASHA's Code of Ethics is discussed in detail (including the ethics complaint adjudication process), and hypothetical case studies are presented under the macro headings of Cultural Competence, Conflict of Interest, and Employer Demands.",1,0

"Abstract The paper focuses on the semantics of distributivity, grammatical number, and cardinality predicates (numerals and modifiers like several ). I argue that constructions involving so-called ‘dependent plurals’, i.e. plurals lacking cardinality predicates occurring in the scope of certain quantificational items such as all and most (e.g. All the girls were wearing hats ), pose a challenge to familiar semantic frameworks that distinguish between two sources of multiplicity: mereological plurality and distributive quantification. I argue that dependent plural readings should be analysed as distinct both from cumulative readings and distributive readings, in the classical sense. I demonstrate how this can be accomplished in a semantic framework where expressions are evaluated relative to sets of assignments, or plural info states (van den Berg, in Stokhof and Torenvliet (eds) Proceedings of the 7th Amsterdam Colloquium, ILLC, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, 1990, in Dekker and Stokhof (eds) Proceedings of the 9th Amsterdam Colloquium, ILLC, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, 1994, Some aspects of the Internal Structure of Discourse. The Dynamics of Nominal Anaphora. PhD thesis, University of Amsterdam, 1996). The specific formal implementation is based on a modified version of Brasoveanu’s (Structured nominal and modal reference. PhD thesis, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, 2007, Linguist Philos 31(2):129–209. 10.1007/s10988-008-9035-0 , 2008) Plural Compositional DRT. In this framework we are able to distinguish between two types of distributivity: weak distributivity across the assignments in a single plural info state and strong distributivity across multiple info states. I argue that both of these types of distributivity play a role in the semantics of natural language, accounting for the contrasting properties of ‘singular quantifiers’, such as each and every , and ‘plural quantifiers’, such as all and most . The contrasting properties of bare plurals and plurals involving cardinality modifiers are analysed in terms of the distinction between state-level and assignment-level (mereological) plurality.",1,0

"Facets of both Old Tibetan and Old Burmese phonology pose problems for the generalisation, known as Laufer‘s law, that -wa- in in Written Burmese corresponds to -o- in Written Tibetan. Some Tibetan words retain the sequence -wa, appearing to contradict Laufer‘s law. Some Written Burmese words with -wa- originate from Old Burmese words written with -o-. To account for these anomalies and the Chinese cognates of the lexemes involved, Laufer‘s law must be understood as the product of four separate sound changes.",1,0

"Nous nous intéressons dans cette contribution, publiée en deux parties, aux idées linguistiques de Lucien Tesnière (1893-1954). Si ce dernier est essentiellement connu pour la syntaxe structurale et pour certains concepts-clés comme ceux de valence ou de translation, en revanche son œuvre est beaucoup plus variée que ce à quoi on la réduit habituellement. Tesnière s’est occupé, en effet, à la fois de linguistique théorique, mais aussi de linguistique appliquée, au sens large du terme, puisqu’il a toujours développé un intérêt majeur pour l’enseignement des langues et pour la géographie linguistique. Il s’est en outre tourné vers la traduction et l’analyse littéraire, en traduisant et commentant l’œuvre du poète slovène Oton Joupantchitch. L’article qui suit est consacré à la partie la plus théorique de la linguistique de Tesnière, sur laquelle nous nous penchons à partir de quatre points : la réhabilitation de la synchronie, la syntaxe structurale et son originalité, la typologie des langues et l’histoire des langues et du langage. La seconde partie de cette contribution, qui paraîtra dans le prochain numéro de Studies about languages, sera quant à elle consacrée à l’aspect plus « pratique » de la linguistique tesnièrienne, bien que celui-ci ne puisse pas être séparé clairement de la théorie, et se focalisera sur la didactique des langues, la géographie linguistique, la traduction et l’analyse littéraire.",1,0

"IN THIS PAPER I am assuming that I am addressing those who have not done fieldwork and that those who have are simply reading with a critical eye. I am assuming also that the informants to be selected are for research in dialect geography and not in social dialectology. William Labov, Roger Shuy, and others active in that specialty have dealt with it elsewhere; I must concern myself with what is within my own experience. The experience of all of us who work with regional speech rests upon one very basic assumption. This is that the speech of a person reflects the speech of the community of which he is a part, specifically of a segment of that community of which he is a part. A man's idiolect is his own, of course, never entirely like anyone else's, but nevertheless it differs only in very small measure from the idiolects of those with whom he associates in his own speech community. Here is where our research differs from that of the social scientist, for in one informant can have a computerized summary of the language of that community. I say we can have, for not everyone you pick up on the street or encounter in a house-by-house survey is a satisfactory informant. When is an informant satisfactory ? When is one acceptable ? A deductive answer can be found, of course, in the clear statement provided by Hans Kurath in chapter 2 of the Handbook of the Linguistic Geography of New England.' With that statement in the back of our heads, let us lead up to the answer inductively. I would like to try to find an answer in terms of generalizations from a number of brief case studies drawn from actual experience. Remember that our basic assumption is that a person's speech is a microcosm of the speech of his language community, that is, of those people who have common speechways, who respond in the same characteristic way to a given need to communicate. If want to study only the older segment of the speech community, naturally want an older person; if want the younger segment, need a younger person. Similarly with respect to educated and uneducated segments or to further arbitrary divisions along a continuum of educational background from illiteracy to the Ph.D.",1,0

"ON OCTOBER 13, 2006, the Washington, D. C, Metropolitan Police Department arrested 133 Gallaudet University students, staff, and alumni, the largest number of university arrests in the United States since the 1960s. The arrests occurred amid weeks of building and campus lockdowns, hunger strikes, a sprawling tent city, rallies, and a two thousand-person march to the Capitol. At a time when many university faculty across the nation lament apathy on campus, Gallaudet University students orchestrated a massive protest that garnered national media attention and forced the Board of Trustees to meet their demand that the president-designate be removed before taking office. What could possibly have sparked such widespread activism? The very causes of the protest were themselves a principle site of vigorous debate. Unlike the 1988 President Now (DPN) movement, which rallied behind the well-defined issue of selecting a deaf president for a deaf university, the 2006 protests were far more complicated and overdetermined. The Gallaudet Protest of 2006 could only be fully explained through a feature-length documentary film or booklength analysis with writers from all perspectives engaged in a critical collaboration with the issues. Such a volume would be able to lay out the escalation of events from the initial protests in May to the campus lockdown in October and the Board's capitulation. Such a volume would also describe the relevance of the protest in this particular historical moment. What do the protests say about political fife in 2006 and beyond? While it is still early to define the legacy of the 2006 protests, they do clearly dramatize issues simmering throughout the pages of Open Your Eyes. In fact, many of the contributors to this volume were deeply involved in the protest - on both sides. Some were members (and even president) of the Board of Trustees, while others were Gallaudet faculty members who played significant roles in the coalition of protesters, the Faculty Student Staff and Alumni (FSSA) coalition. What's more, the figure at the center of the controversy, then-Provost Jane Fernandes, provided financial support for, and participated in, the Studies Think Tank that gave rise to this volume. Given that many of the debates and issues in this volume were dramatized before a national authence when the manuscript had already been delivered to the publisher, it seems only fitting that a postscript be added - not to advocate for one side or the other, not to delve into the minutiae of this or that event, but to take a wide-angle lens on the protest, to place it in a historical, cultural, and political context. One of the most striking and relevant issues is the widespread disagreement on the very reasons for protest in the first place. The University administration asserted that the protest erupted out of a deep cultural anxiety about radical changes wrought by medical and technological advances, such as cochlear implants, that offer deaf people opportunities to become immersed into the hearing world rather than in the separate culture revolving around American Sign Language (ASL). Dr. Jane Fernandes, who is deaf though she grew up speaking and did not learn ASL until the age of twenty-three, symbolized a future that her critics were resisting. According to this fine of reasoning she was not culturally Deaf enough to be the public face of Gallaudet University. Protesters denied these claims, citing the fact that 82 percent of the faculty asked for the president-designate 's resignation or removal from office, which is especially significant given the fact that only 3 8 percent of the faculty are deaf, out of which only a small portion are native users of ASL. Instead, the protesters' grievances included a long list of concerns: the lack of diversity among the finalists, the Board of Trustees' lack of responsiveness to students of color, the persistence of audism on campus, and the appearance of an unfair search process that led to the appointment of a widely unpopular, internal candidate. …",1,0

When Magdalen Vanstone discovers she is both illegitimate and disinherited after her parents’ sudden death, she loses her wealth, social identity, and name in one. Deprived of her family name, Magdalen begins to embody the sinful (and ultimately repentant) associations of her Christian name as she plots to win back her wealth by marrying her cousin under a false identity. Yet when she succeeds in her plan and is once again reduced to namelessness and powerlessness by her husband, she becomes emblematic of all Victorian women under the doctrine of coverture who lost both their independent social identities and control over their wealth when they married and gave up their family names.",1,0

"Deaf Lives: Nineteenth-Century Spanish Deaf Girls and Women Susan Plann This article is about the lives of nineteenth-century Spanish deaf girls and women.1 The research I present here is contained in a larger work, a book titled Portraits from the Spanish National Deaf-mute School, to be published by Gallaudet University Press. These ""portraits"" are in fact biographical essays on nineteenth-century deaf people and their educators, all of them connected in one way or another to the Spanish National Deaf School in Madrid. The subjects include one deaf male teacher, two hearing men, two deaf boys, and one deaf-blind boy. There is also a chapter on nineteenth-century deaf girls and their women teachers (all of these teachers were hearing). But significantly, there is not a single chapter on an individual nineteenth-century deaf girl or woman. The reason for this is simple: There is a dearth of information in this area. Because deaf people were not considered important, little information was preserved about them in general. Moreover, information on Spanish deaf students is particularly hard to come by: They were usually children from the lower classes, and the particulars of their lives were not deemed worthy of recording. Yet it is important to seek such information because it gives voice to ordinary deaf people, a voice that is too often absent from the historical record. And despite the scarcity of sources, some do exist. In the case of the National School, one of the most interesting [End Page 167] sources is the archival records of investigations at the school. These investigations were most often conducted when problems arose (discipline problems, for instance). Archival records sometimes include transcripts of students' testimony, accounts of their experiences as told in their own words—their own signs. Despite the existence of these sources, it is still difficult to learn much about the lives of deaf girls. Deaf girls, like deaf boys, were not looked upon as important. In fact, because of their gender, society considered them of even less consequence than deaf boys, so few facts about them were recorded or preserved. Deaf girls were also less prone to getting into trouble at school than were deaf boys. So when discipline problems arose, girls were less likely to be involved; consequently, they were less likely to be interviewed. As a result, even less information about them remains. The trail goes cold with their admissions files, and we are left with only names, dates and places of birth, dates of arrival and departure from the school, and a few facts about family background. Nevertheless, it is possible to reconstruct aspects of nineteenth- century deaf girls and women's collective lives. and that is what I have done in this article. In the account that follows I have made use of various sources, including both published works and archival documents, to examine these deaf female lives from a variety of perspectives. As we will see, a woman teacher provides one particularly interesting perspective. To begin, we should note that, during the 1800s, the education of Spanish girls lagged consistently behind that of Spanish boys, which was true of deaf and hearing children alike. Fewer hearing girls than hearing boys attended school, and there were fewer schools for them. At the National Deaf School, girls were always outnumbered by boys.2 The National School opened in 1805, but it was thirty years before deaf girls were admitted as day students; it was almost fifty years before they were admitted as boarders.3 During the nineteenth century it was generally accepted that women's purpose in life was to marry and raise a family. Thus the principal objective of their education was to prepare them to be wives and mothers and to teach them to run a household. Homemaking and moral formation took precedence over the three Rs, and [End Page 168] the same ideology that informed the curriculum for hearing girls at public schools also shaped the...",1,0

"Learning by invention is an alternative approach to teaching statistics where students are tasked with attempting to solve a problem before being taught the canonical formula for solving it, often resulting in increased understanding of material compared with traditional instruction. The first study, conducted in a college statistics classroom with mixed-skill groups, extended previous work showing an advantage for learning-by-invention activities compared with a lecture-first control. A second study explored group interactions that led to benefits from learning-by-invention activities. Successful groups were more likely to propose solutions and less likely to propose arbitrary formulas or highlight group members' math skills. The features of small group interactions that may help or harm learning during invention activities are discussed.",1,0

"Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a highly prevalent disease affecting an estimated 2–4% of the adult male population that is difficult and very costly to diagnose because symptoms can remain unnoticed for years. The reference diagnostic method, Polysomnography (PSG), requires the patient to spend a night at the hospital monitored by specialized equipment. Therefore fast and less costly screening techniques are normally applied for setting priorities to proceed to the polysomnography diagnosis. In this article the use of speech analysis is proposed as an alternative or complement to existing screening methods. A set of voice features that could be related to apnoea are defined, based on previous results from other authors and our own analysis. These features are analyzed first in isolation and then in combination to assess their discriminative power to classify voices as corresponding to apnoea patients and healthy subjects. This analysis is performed in a database containing three repetitions of four carefully designed sentences read by 40 healthy subjects and 42 subjects suffering from severe apnoea. As a result of the analysis, a linear discriminant model (LDA) was defined including a subset of eight features (signal-to-disperiodicity ratio, a nasality measure, harmonic-to-noise ratio, jitter, difference between third and second formants on a specific vowel, duration of two of the sentences and the percentage of silence in one of the sentences). This model was tested on a separate database containing 20 healthy and 20 apnoea subjects yielding a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 75%, with a F1-measure of 81%. These results indicate that the proposed method, only requiring a few minutes to record and analyze the patient's voice during the visit to the specialist, could help in the development of a non-intrusive, fast and convenient PSG-complementary screening technique for OSA.",1,0

"Abstract Background Understanding the pattern of non-linguistic abilities in aphasia has been a controversial question. We hypothesized that only some aphasia patients, particularly patients with fluent forms of aphasia and global aphasia, would present deficits in non-linguistic abilities. Methods & procedures We studied 200 vascular aphasia patients (119 men and 81 women; mean age = 57.37 years, SD = 15.56) at the Cognitive Communicative Speech Language Pathology Unit at the Clinical Hospital University of Chile (Santiago, Chile). The mean time post onset was 6.57 months (SD = 12.94). The Spanish versions of Western Aphasia Battery Revised (SWAB-R) and the Spanish version of the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination (SBDAE) were administered. We used the SWAB-R Part 1 to determine the aphasia severity (Aphasia Quotient: AQ). SWAB-R Part 2 was used to study nonverbal abilities; a Non-Linguistic Quotient (NLQ) was calculated. The SBDAE was used in determining the type of aphasia. Outcomes & results Deficits were particularly evident in Global, Mixed non-fluent, and Transcortical Motor aphasia, followed by Wernicke and Transcortical Sensory aphasia. Deficits were mildest in Amnesic, Conduction, and Broca aphasia. Correlation between linguistic and non-linguistic deficits were found to be statistically significant. Conclusion Our results support previous studies: non-linguistic abilities can be affected in aphasia, but there is an important variability. Some aphasia patients can present non-linguistic deficits. Verbal and nonverbal deficits are significantly correlated, suggesting some communality in their brain organization.",1,0

"The Russian Federation, established after the breakup of the USSR in the early 1990s, is the largest country in the world (Blinnikov, 2011). Russians have long considered their capital, Moscow, and the adjoining city of St Petersburg, to be the centres of culture and commerce, as well of the arts and educational facilities. Due to the large size of their country, Russians designate areas west of the Ural Mountains informally as “European Russia.” The Russian territories known as Siberia and the Russian Far East extend east of the Urals to the Pacific Ocean, and cover approximately 10% of the world's land mass (Yudin, 2006). In May 2000, President Putin designated nine federal subjects (provinces and republics) of Siberia as the Siberian Federal District ( http://russiatrek.org/siberia-district ).

"EXCEEPT FOR the no doubt apocryphal 'You said a mouthful, Queen' variously attributed to Mrs. Mayor Hylan (to use a somewhat old-fashioned but useful Americanism) and to Mayor 'Jimmy' Walker,' the royal style has presented little difficulty to Americans-certainly none in the third person. It is true that during and immediately after the First World War the Kaiser was frequently referred to editorially as William (or Wilhelm) Hohenzollern (sometimes preceded by Mr.), the implication being, apparently, that for all his ancestors, his uniforms, and his fiercely upturned mustachios, he was really no better than, even if superficially somewhat different from, Mr. John Smith, American. But this was intentional perversity on the part of writers who knew perfectly well that dynastic names like Hohenzollern, Windsor, and Hapsburg are not the equivalent of surnames. Although it is unlikely that a majority of our citizens are aware of these facts, Americans are nevertheless given to referring to the British monarch as Queen Elizabeth, not as Elizabeth Windsor or Elizabeth Mountbatten (the styles are equally incongruous, inasmuch as Mountbatten is merely a partial translation of Battenberg, a dynastic name like Windsor). This is dictated largely by a tradition which is easy to follow, but also to some extent by an awesome respect for royalty as such. For there can be no serious doubt that, as Eleanor Roosevelt has written in This I Remember, 'Even in this country, where people have shed their blood to be independent of a king, there is still an awe of and an interest in royalty and the panoply which surrounds it.'2 The awe and the interest of which this great democrat writes are reflected, if somewhat distortedly, in the multiplicity of queens-with an occasional king--who adorn modem American life: apple blossom queens, bobsled queens, citrus queens, not to mention radio's 'Queen for a Day.' One can hardly throw a stone on the campus of an American coeducational institution without running the fearsome risk of hitting royalty of",1,0

"In Vedic Sanskrit about 150 forms in -si, formed from 23 roots, are used as imperatives of the 2nd singular. Among the most frequent in the Rigveda are yaksi 'sacrifice' (34 times), vaksi 'carry, bring' (25 times), parsi 'bring across' (16 times), nesi 'lead' (10 times), darsi 'pierce' (10 times), satsi (10 times), rdsi 'bestow' (8 times). Until quite recently the position of these forms within the Vedic verbal system has usually been left undecided. In 1955 Burrow merely noted that their 'termination is identical with that of the 2 sg. indic. pres., but these indicatives are quite clearly distinguished because the presents are differently formed'.' Three years earlier, Renou expressed the view that the type in question was 'une formation autonome, oi une ancienne d6sinence -s a pu etre prolong6e par un i d6ictique'.2 The decisive advance, alluded to above, is due to the recent work of Johanna Narten,3 but especially to George Cardona's excellent paper published only a year ago.4 Whereas Narten still insisted that the formation was 'bildungsmassig ausserhalb des Tempussystems stehend' (39), although she admitted that in several cases the imperative in -si 'im vedischen Sprachgefiihl wohl zum sAorist gerechnet [wurde]' (45), Cardona cogently showed that the -si imperative was not only part of the s-aorist system but was most closely linked with the s-aorist subjunctive. The close connection is particularly clearly shown by Cardona's groups I and II (5). The two groups comprise only 10 roots out of a total of 23-which might seem a not very high proportion-but they account for 112 out of the 150 imperatives in -si, i.e. for over two-thirds of all occurrences. All these verbs form an s-aorist while their present is quite different so that the imperative in -si cannot be placed in the present system but only in the s-aorist. Syntactically, too, the forms in -si behave in the same way as the s-subjunctives (Cardona 6). There can be no doubt therefore that the 'imperatives' in -si and the s-subjunctives form, from the descriptive point of view, a complementary system. The systematic correlation is illustrated by the pairs yaksi/yaksat, vaksi/vaksat(i), etc.",1,0

"Melodies Unheard:Deaf Poets and Their Subversion of the ""Sound"" Theory of Poetry John Lee Clark (bio) The deaf poet is no oxymoron. But one would think so, given the popular understanding that poetry has sound and voice at its heart. Add to this the popular philosophy that maintains that deafness reduces the human experience, and the result is that deaf poets are often objects of amazement or dismissal and their work is rarely judged on its merit beyond the context of their deafness. Deaf poets in the United States have had to contend with sound not only because some members of the mainstream culture consider deaf people a lesser variety of the human race but also because so much emphasis has been placed on sound as it relates to their chosen art. This marginalization was especially acute in the nineteenth century, when poetry was expected to consist of a rhyme scheme and an identifiable metrical pattern. Such requirements so discouraged deaf poet John Carlin (18131891) that he considered giving up on poetry. ""I was convinced,"" he wrote, ""that I could never be what I so ardently desireda correct writer of verses."" Fortunately, the perceptive hearing poet William Cullen Bryant pressed Carlin to continue writing poetry and recommended that he rely on rhyming dictionaries. Carlin eventually published many poems, including [End Page 4] ""The Mute's Lament"" in the first issue of American Annals of the Deaf and Dumb in 1847. However, the hearing editor could not resist adding a note to the poem: ""How shall he who has not now and who never has had the sense of hearing, who is totally without what the musicians call an ear, succeed in preserving all the niceties of accent, measure, and rhythm? We should almost as soon expect a man born blind to become a landscape painter as one born deaf to produce poetry of even tolerable merit."" Despite the reaction of incredulity that Carlin's poems evoked, deaf poet Laura C. Redden (18391923) initially experienced the opposite. That the acclaimed ""Howard Glyndon"" (Redden's nom de plume) was a woman was well known, but that she was also deaf was not. When critics learned of the fact, many of them lowered their earlier opinion of her poetry. Infuriated, Redden responded with her 1870 autobiographical allegory, ""Down Low"" (later retitled ""The Realm of Singing""), in which she portrays herself as a bird with a crippled wing trying to make a place for herself in the fabled Realm of Singing. After some attempts, the bird wins praise from a band of soldiers passing through the forest on their way home. But when the soldiers discover that the bird is crippled, they abandon her, saying, as did Redden's critics, ""What have we here? A crippled bird that tries to sing? Such a thing was never heard of before. It is impossible for her to sing correctly under such circumstances and we were certainly mistaken in thinking that there was anything in such songs. Our ears have deceived us.'"" Readers will agree that a crippled wing has nothing to do with a bird's ability to sing. Yet many will nevertheless pause before applying this concept to deafness and poetry. Even some deaf poets themselves were plagued by doubts about their ability to write poetryor at least ""good"" poetry that would be respected by the mainstream audience. Such doubts have always been linked with audism, which is the beliefimposed by the hearing society and internalized by many Deaf peoplethat people with ""hearing loss"" are inferior. One troubled poet was Howard L. Terry, who wrote in the foreword to his 1929 book, Sung in Silence, ""In offering these poems to the public I feel as if I were throwing a snowball into a red-hot furnace!"" Terry [End Page 5] anticipated that he would not find many appreciative readers because his poems savored of the old formalism. In defense, he explained his view of the problems the deaf poet faced: Deafness retards daily mental growth. The deaf man slowly falls behind his hearing brother. He moves with the slower shore current, while his fortunate brother is hurrying along...",1,0

"The publication of a scholarly book is always the conjunction of an author's desire (or need) to disseminate their experience and knowledge and the interest or expectations of a potential community of readers to gain benefit from the publication itself. Michael Piotrowski has indeed managed to optimize this relation by bringing to the public a compendium of information that I think has been heavily awaited by many scholars having to deal with corpora of historical texts. The book covers most topics related to the acquisition, encoding, and annotation of historical textual data, seen from the point of view of their linguistic content. As such, it does not address issues related, for instance, to scholarly editions of these texts, but conveys a wealth of information on the various aspects where recent developments in language technology may help digital humanities projects to be aware of the current state of the art in the field.Still, the book is not an encyclopedic description of such technologies. It is based on the experience acquired by the author within the corpus development projects he has been involved in, and reflects in particular the specific topics on which he has made more in-depth explorations. It is thus written more as a series of returns on experience than a systematic resource to which one would want to return after its initial reading.The book is organized as a series of nine short chapters.In the first two (very short) chapters, the author presents the general scope of the book and provides an overview of the reasons why natural language processing (NLP) has such an entrenched position in digital humanities at large and the study of historical text in particular. Citing several prominent projects and corpus initiatives that have taken place in the last few decades, Piotrowski defends the thesis, which I share, that a deep understanding of textual documents requires some basic knowledge of language processing methods and techniques. Chapter 2 in particular (“NLP and Digital Humanities”) could be read as an autonomous position paper, which, independently of the following chapters, presents the current landscape of infrastructural initiatives and scholarly projects that shape this convergence between the two fields.Chapter 3 (“Spelling in Historical Texts,” pp. 11–23) describes the various issues related to spelling variations in historical text. It shows how difficult it may be to deal with both diachronic (e.g., in comparison to modern standardized spellings) and synchronic (degree of stabilization of historical spellings) variations, especially in the context of the uncertainty brought about by the transcription process itself. This is particularly true for historical manuscripts and Piotrowski goes deeply into this, showing some concrete examples of the kind of hurdles that a scholar may fall into. This is the kind of short introduction I would recommend for anyone, in particular students, wanting to gain a first understanding in the domain of historical spelling.Chapter 4 is the longest chapter in the book (“Acquiring Historical Texts,” pp. 25–52) and covers various aspects of the digitization workflow that needs to be set up to create a corpus of historical texts. The chapter is quite difficult to read as a single unit because of its intrinsic heterogeneity. Indeed, it covers quite a wide range of topics: presentation of existing digitization projects worldwide, technical issues related to scanning, comparison of various optical character recognition systems for various types of scripts, the potential role of lexical resources, crowdsourcing for optical character recognition (OCR) post-processing, and manual or semi-automatic keying. Getting an overview of the various topics is even more difficult because of the way the author has followed his own personal experience, and alternates between general considerations and in-depth presentations of concrete results. Pages 34–40, for instance, is one single subsection on the comparison of OCR outputs that goes into so much detail that it breaks the continuity of the argument, although in itself this subsection could be really interesting for a specialized reader. This chapter illustrates the point that the content of this book would benefit from being published in a more modern and open setting.Data representation aspects are covered in Chapter 5 (“Text Encoding and Annotation Schemes,” pp. 53–68), which tackles two specific issues, namely, character and document encoding. On these two, the author presents what could be considered best practices. For character encoding, the book rightly focuses on the advantages that the move towards ISO 10646/Unicode has brought to the community. The corresponding sub-section actually covers three different aspects: It first makes an extensive presentation of the history of character encoding standards (from ASCII/ISO 646 to Unicode/ISO 10646), it provides insights into the current coverage and encoding principles (e.g., UTF-8 vs. UTF-16) of ISO 10646, and finally, it focuses on the specific difficulties occurring in historical texts both from the point of view of legacy ASCII-based transcription languages and the management of characters that are not present in Unicode. Although well documented, these three topics should have been more clearly separated so that readers interested in one or the other could directly refer to it. This is a typical case where, given the great expertise of the author on the subject, I can imagine the corresponding texts being published on-line as separate entries in a blog. The second half of the chapter focuses on the role of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) guidelines for the transcription and encoding of historical text. It covers the various representation levels that may be concerned (metadata, text structure, surface annotation) and insists on the current difficulty of linking current NLP tools to TEI encoded documents. Although this is indeed still an issue in general, it might have been interesting to refer to standards (ISO 24611– MAF) and initiatives (Textgrid core encoding at the token level; the TXM platform for text mining) that have started to provide concrete sustainable answers to the issue.The following chapter (“Handling Spelling Variations,” pp. 69–84), provides a series of short studies describing possible methods for dealing with OCR errors or spelling variations as described in Chapter 3. Independent of the fact that I find it strange to see the two chapters set quite far from one another, Chapter 6 distinguishes itself by its profound heterogeneity. Whereas several sections do have the most appropriate level of detail and topicality for historical texts (in particular those on canonicalization), some sections seem to be completely off topic (Section 6.2, “Edit Distance,” describes what I would consider as background knowledge for such a book). It is all the more disappointing that the author shows here a very high level of expertise and, as in the case of Chapter 3, I would strongly recommend the reading of the relevant sections to newcomers in the field.In contrast with the previous chapter, Chapter 7 (“NLP Tools for Historical Languages,” pp. 85–100) is more coherent and focused. It mainly addresses the morpho-syntactic analysis of historical text and presents, through concrete deployment scenarios, possible methods to constrain the appropriate parsers, in a context where hardly any existing tools can be simply re-used. The chapter is very well documented and refers to most of the relevant initiatives in the domain of morphology for historical text, at least on the European scene. This focus may also be misleading because recent work on named entity recognition on historical texts are not at all mentioned and are probably, to my view, one of the most promising direction for enhanced digital scholarship.The last chapter (“Historical Corpora,” pp. 101–116) is a compendium, sorted by language, of the major historical corpora available worldwide. It shows the dynamic that currently exists in the community and is an essential background resource to both understanding who is active in maintaining historical corpora and discerning the most relevant resources. The chapter as a whole provides an interesting “historical” perspective on the progress made by most text-based projects in using the TEI guidelines as their reference standard. It seems quite difficult now to imagine an initiative which would not take TEI for granted, and would not build inside the TEI framework. On another issue, namely, copyright, Piotrowski also provides an interesting analysis on the difficulty of re-using old editions which have been recently re-edited on paper, and thus fall into some publisher's copyright restrictions. The conclusion could have been a little tougher here though, and probably should have recommended putting a hold on any paper publication of historical sources by a private publisher unless it is guaranteed that the electronic material can be used freely, under an appropriate open license.As a whole, the book leaves the reader with a mixed feeling of enthusiasm and disappointment. Enthusiasm, because the content is so rich that it should serve as background reference (and indeed be quoted) for any further work on the creation, management, and curation of historical corpora. Still, I cannot help thinking that the editorial setting as a book is not the most appropriate setting for such content. The variety of topics that are addressed as well as the heterogeneous level of detail provided through the different chapters would benefit from a more fragmented treatment. Indeed, this would be the perfect content for a series of blog entries (for instance, in a scholarly blog such as those on the hypotheses.org platform) which in turn would allow an interested reader to discover exactly the topics they want information about and cite the corresponding entries. With the bibliography in Zotero and relevant pointers to the corresponding on-line corpora or tools, I could imagine the resulting content soon becoming one of the most cited on-line resources. I am sure the author would gain more visibility in doing so than having the material hidden on a library shelf or behind a paywall. Not knowing the exact copyright transfer agreement associated with the book, I cannot judge if it is too late for the author to think in these terms, but this could be a lesson for scholars who are now planning to write such an introductory publication. Is the book still the best medium?",1,0

This phenomenon turns out to be connected to a number of basic problems that can only be understood through investigation of institutional processes with routine operations that may disadvantage certain minorities. This paper presents and discusses part of the data collected in a larger research project on Latino families and Canadian schools. Bilingual Latina researchers used participant observation and action research techniques to report on the home language practices of 45 Latino families and how the school's routine processes influenced those practices. Findings include the following: (a) parents saw Spanish maintenance as a way to foster family unity. Latino identity, and professional advancement; (b) the strong assimilative pressures experienced by parents often resulted in their doubting the desirability of openly speaking Spanish at home; (c) because the children were losing their home language rapidly, the parents used a number of strategies; and (d) there are several things that parents would like to see happen that would enable them to maintain Spanish. Our findings indicate the necessity for schools to proactively recognize and build on the family's cultural capital, including their home language.",1,0

"Previous studies found that repeated references in successful communication are often reduced, not only at the acoustic level, but also in terms of words and manual co-speech gestures. In the present study, we investigated whether repeated references are still reduced in a situation when reduction would not be beneficial for the communicative situation, namely after the speaker receives negative feedback from the addressee. In a director–matcher task (experiment I), we studied gesture rate, as well as the general form of the gestures produced in initial and repeated references. In a separate experiment (experiment II) we studied whether there might (also) be more gradual differences in gesture form between gestures in initial and repeated references, by asking human judges which of two gestures (one from an initial and one from a repeated reference following negative feedback) they considered more precise. In both experiments, mutual visibility was added as a between subjects factor. Results showed that after negative feedback, gesture rate increased in a marginally significant way. With regard to gesture form, we found little evidence for changes in gesture form after negative feedback, except for a marginally significant increase of the number of repeated strokes within a gesture. Lack of mutual visibility only had a significant reducing effect on gesture size, and did not interact with repetition in any way. However, we did find gradual differences in gesture form, with gestures produced after negative feedback being judged as marginally more precise than initial gestures. The results from the present study suggest that in the production of unsuccessful repeated references, a process different from the reduction process as found in previous studies in repeated references takes place, with speakers appearing to put more effort into their gestures after negative feedback, as suggested by the data trending towards an increased gesture rate and towards gestures being judged as more precise after feedback.",1,0

Como instrumento de recolección de información se utilizó la toma de nota y se analizaron nueve muestras que contenían los cumplidos forzados. Con base en la clasificación de Adachi (2010), se encontraron cuatro muestras que corresponden a la estrategia de alardear. Las cinco muestras restantes se agrupan en una nueva categoría: estrategia de compromiso social. En el análisis lingüístico se encontró que los interlocutores utilizan enunciados exclamativos, sufijos, adverbios e interjecciones que ayudan a intensificar la fuerza ilocutiva del cumplido. También se hallaron algunas palabras pertenecientes al parlache. Así mismo, los interlocutores alternan diferentes formas de tratamiento en un turno y se utiliza la autocortesía.

"Abstract Swallowing impairments co-occur with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) leading to aspiration, disease exacerbations, and malnutrition. This pilot survey study aimed to identify current clinical practice patterns for swallowing evaluation and treatment in persons with COPD. A 35-question Qualtrics survey was deployed to medical speech-language pathology (SLP) social media sites and professional boards; flyers were distributed at a professional conference. Forty-eight SLPs completed the study. SLPs routinely include a clinical swallow examination (96%), videofluoroscopic swallowing study (79%), adjunctive respiratory measures (respiratory rate [83%], and pulse oximetry [67%], respiratory–swallow pattern [77%]) but less frequently include fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (23%). Self-reported advanced clinical experience and expert respiratory analysis skills were associated with adjunctive respiratory measure (respiratory rate, pulse oximetry) inclusion during assessment. Compensatory strategy training (77%) is a preferred treatment for dysphagia in COPD; however, respiratory–swallow pattern training and expiratory muscle strength training are increasing in use. SLPs self-report a comprehensive, individualized patient-centered care approach with inclusion of adjunctive respiratory-focused methods in dysphagia evaluation and treatment practice in persons with COPD. Advances in the identification of the integral role of respiratory function in swallowing integrity may be translating to clinical practice methods for dysphagia management in persons with COPD.",1,0

"Abstract All organisms are autonomous, self-organizing wholes separated by semi-permeable boundaries from a surrounding environment. Across these boundaries conveyances of action and passion are channeled through efferent and afferent pathways. I analyze this scheme in terms of two fundamental processes: semiosis and control. I propose a unified account of the functioning of semiosis and of controlling and controlled actions by viewing organisms as systems that separate their responses (actions) from the actions their environment exerts upon them (passions). Semiosis and goal-directed action are seen as complementary forms of causation. Examples from cell physiology and the functioning of efferent and afferent pathways in plants and animals illustrate and expand these ideas. Based on this interpretation of the relations between semiosis and control I reach a generalized conception of purposeful action, linking the expansion of semiotic capacities throughout biological evolution to a concomitant increase in an organism’s powers for intervention in its environment. The fruitfulness of these ideas is substantiated through examples showing how they make intelligible phenomena previously deemed disparate. Examples include similarities and differences between signs and instruments, and analogies in the evolution of organisms and artifacts.",1,0

"Several studies have dealt with the Kurdish minorities in different regions far and wide, but few studies have focused on the Kurds of Baghdad, Iraq, especially after the 2005 Constitution which supported the Kurdish language. This study aims at investigating the contexts wherein the Kurdish language is used by the Kurds of Baghdad and their attitudes towards their ethnic language (Kurdish) to see if the official status that has been accorded to it is mirrored in society. To do so, a sample of 100 respondents selected from the Kurdish community living in Baghdad took part in a questionnaire and pilot interviews. The study shows that home and family are the most common contexts within which the Kurds use the Kurdish language. Results also show that Arabic and Kurdish are used side by side within the neighborhood, workplace, and education institutions contexts. As for attitudes towards Kurdish, the participants have displayed positive attitudes towards their ethnic language and felt proud of it as a unifying symbol of the Kurdish nation. This study concludes that the new official status that has been given to Kurdish for over fifteen years has not been in force yet and suggests directions for future research on language policy in Iraq. Keywords: Language Use, Language Attitudes, Kurds, Kurdish, Iraq.",1,0

"The Role of Stellenbosch University's Department of Afrikaans and Dutch in the Development of Afrikaans Lexicography: Development under Dutch Influence. This article investigates the role of Stellenbosch University's Department of Afrikaans and Dutch in the development of Afrikaans lexicography through their involvement in two standard descriptive dictionaries, the Verklarende Handwoordeboek van die Afrikaanse Taal en Nasionale Woordeboek . This is done against the background of the influence of Dutch on Afrikaans lexicography. The influence of Dutch on both the macro- and microstructures of these dictionaries are investigated. A gradual movement away from Dutch influence and the contribution of these dictionaries to the development of Afrikaans lexicography are also indicated. When corresponding editions of the two dictionaries are compared, Nasionale Woordeboek seems to show less Dutch influence than Verklarende Handwoordeboek van die Afrikaanse Taal . However, since the beginning of the 1990s (after no new editions Nasionale Woordeboek appeared) Verklarende Handwoordeboek van die Afrikaanse Taal has slowly but surely started to free itself from Dutch influence. The result of this is that the most recent edition of the Verklarende Handwoordeboek van die Afrikaanse Taal gives evidence of Afrikaans as an independent language that no longer needs to rely on Dutch.",1,0

"Herbert Ernst Wiegand is a very important figure in international metalexicography. A large part of his research has up to now been unavailable to the majority of the English-speaking world, because it has mainly been published in German. A new book Semantics and Lexicography seeks to break through this obscurity by providing English translations of a selection of articles spanning thirty years (from 1976 to 1996), which trace the development of Wiegand's views on semantic information. This book offers a valuable insight into the theoretical and corresponding terminological development that has already had such a remarkable impact on the ""practical science"" metalexicography. This article focuses on Wiegand's theories on the integration of the semasiological and onomasiological presentation of semantic information in the microstructures of general monolingual dictionaries. The theories are explicated and illustrated by examples from two Afrikaans general monolingual dictionaries and evaluated in order to establish their relevance. The conclusion is reached that the semasiological presentation of meaning is most appropriately located in the item giving the meaning paraphrase, which should form part of the semantic comment in an integrated microstructure. In the semantic comment, this item must be followed by dearly distinguished items giving onomasiological information, especially about synonymy.",1,0

"El presente artículo analiza los verbos prometer y jurar como verbos que designan dos actos ilocutivos, compromisivo y asertivo, en dos variedades del español, el español de España y el español de México. En el trabajo se muestra que el valor asertivo de prometer es percibido como extraño por algunos hablantes de México mientras que es aceptado en los hablantes de España. El análisis de corpus muestra que prometer asertivo se emplea en ambas variantes con una frecuencia reducida y que no es un uso novedoso en el español. El análisis, además, permite observar que la distinción entre enunciados realizativos y no realizativos es relevante para la descripción de prometer y jurar con dos valores: aunque prometer es mayoritariamente usado como compromisivo, su empleo como asertivo es más importante en los realizativos que en los no realizativos. Jurar, por su parte, es mayoritariamente asertivo pero en los enunciados no realizativos es más frecuente como compromisivo. Este análisis contribuye a profundizar en la relación entre la teoría de los actos de habla la descripción lingüística basada en datos reales.",1,0

"Siguiendo la perspectiva del Analisis Estrategico del Discurso (Menendez 1997), este trabajo aborda el funcionamiento discursivo de los significados de Atribucion extravocalizada, en el marco del Sistema de Compromiso, tal como lo entiende la Appraisal Theory (Martin 2000a, b y c; White 2001a y c, 2003; Martin y White 2005; Hood y Martin 2005). La riqueza de esta teoria radica en el hecho de que complementa y enriquece los estudios de la metafuncion interpersonal del lenguaje desde la Linguistica Sistemico Funcional (Butler 2003; Halliday 1970, 1988; Halliday y Matthiessen 2004). El objetivo de este articulo es exponer de que modo los significados de Atribucion colaboran con la funcion interpersonal y la realizacion estrategica de una serie discursiva (Menendez 1997) particular perteneciente al genero discursivo legislativo (Bajtin 1953; Menendez 1997). La serie seleccionada para el analisis se denomina “ciclo lectivo anual minimo” y esta conformada por cuatro textos: el Convenio MECyT No 337/03, las Declaraciones C.F.C y E No 05/04 y 06/05 y la Resolucion CFE No 94/10.

本文認為時間副詞「在」的功能可以表動作進行或狀態持續。這兩種來源不同，表狀態持續義是「處所動詞＞時間副詞」的演變，這是在靜態語境中，誘發隱喻機制而形成。表動作進行義則是「處所動詞＞處所介詞＞時間副詞」的演變，這是在動態語境中，連動結構發生語義級降後，再藉由「在+指示代詞」的虛指用法，進而脫落處所詞而產生。此兩條演變途徑，具類型學上意義，可藉由跨語言比較得到印證。時間副詞「正在」的形成是在因果語境中，「〔正〕_(副)+〔在+VP〕_(動賓／介賓)」無法以「正+在+VP+之時」解釋，使VP轉為動作事件焦點，而重新分析為「〔正在〕_(副)+〔VP〕_(動詞組)」。,1,0

"The Semantics of Science is, we are told, about ‘the assumptions about language that scientists make in their work’ (SS, pp. vii–viii). Here, then, is a book purportedly about the work of science on the one hand, and what presuppositions about language scientists make as they do their work on the other. It turns out that this early announcement does not mean that Harris discusses the activities of scientists as they design and conduct experiments, work in laboratories and the field, keep records, collect, analyse and interpret data, and interact in a multitude of other ways as they divide epistemic labour. More specifically Harris claims to consider two questions: ‘What does science require of language?’ and ‘What does language require of science?’ Harris’s engagement with these questions is an exercise in developing integrationism, his own approach to the field of linguistics. Actually, that characterisation is too narrow – it would be better to say that integrationism is an approach to all of human intellectual endeavour, since the argument Harris makes also ranges over issues in areas including epistemology, metaphysics and philosophy of mathematics, and because this book complements recent ones on language and art (Harris, 2003) and language and history (Harris, 2004). The present book comprises nine chapters and two appendices. I will present a brief overview here, postponing discussion of some of the terminology occurring in the overview for later. The architecture of the book is unsurprising, given that here as always Harris maintains that Western thought has been consistently dominated by a ‘language myth’ and that integrationism alone can dispel the fog. The first chapter apparently shows Aristotle articulating and endorsing a ‘reocentric semantics’. A range of later thinkers, especially in the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries are discussed in Chapter 2, showing the development of science as a ‘supercategory’. Chapter 3 concerns the early years of the Royal Society, and conflict between experimentalists and those they were displacing, including alchemists, especially conflict regarding the way to write about experiments. Chapter 4 argues that",1,0

"Abstract Current linguistic landscape studies of tourism are primarily concerned with the commodification of languages, and less attention is focused on ownership discourses that are constructed in tourist spaces through varied semiotic resources. This study employs a spatial perspective to analyse commodification and ownership in the linguistic landscape of Bendigo, Victoria, Australia, focusing on how these discourses materialise in the conceived, perceived, and lived spaces through the semiotic resources of Chinese communities. Built on a comprehensive dataset of photographs, field notes, interviews, and archived materials, this study reveals the agency of Bendigo’s Chinese community members, who claim ownership of semiotic resources despite the institutional forces seeking to commodify Chinese cultural heritage for tourist consumption. Examination of Chinese heritage sites demonstrates the possibility of shared ownership of Chinese semiotic resources among Chinese and non-Chinese residents in an Australian cultural tourism context. This balancing act of commodification and ownership constitutes a critical part of the lived experiences of Chinese communities in today’s era of mobility and globalisation.",1,0

"This article returns to the knotty question of minority language maintenance in the face of impositions of hegemonic national language(s) in postcolonial Africa. Drawing on postcolonial resistance theories, empirical data on the language ecology of Zimbabwe and case studies from other multilingual African contexts, the article is a rethink of the agency of minority ethnolinguistic groups to the declining use of their languages. The article confronts an issue that has so far not been addressed directly by research scholarship on African sociolinguistics – the role of minorities in the marginalisation of their own languages. The premise is that the imposition of hegemonic languages is not always achieved without any form of resistance and/or consent from speakers of dominated languages. It is concluded that in spite of the existence of official language policies, there is still room for ‘unplanned’ language planning activities to be used in resisting hegemonic language ideologies.",1,0

"Abstract In 1973, a collectively written manifesto titled Theses on the Semiotic Study of Cultures was penned under the leadership of Tartu scholar Juri Lotman together with his Moscow colleagues Vjacheslav Ivanov, Vladimir Toporov, Aleksandr Pjatigorskij, and Boris Uspenskij. The appearance of this work marked the birth of a new scholarly field of research called the semiotics of culture. In the present contribution we provide a bibliographic list of republications and translations of this seminal text.",1,0

"The comment 'unrecorded in dictionaries accessible to me' accompanied the inquiry. Whitman's unfamiliar noun with -ain two syllables remains mostly unrecorded, it is true, but unmistakably it was the form current in his region, and known to the poet, of the now pretty standard curlicue, curlycue, curleycue, and so forth, meaning a twist or flourish, often fantastic. It is used of handwriting, of ornaments in architecture, of figures made in ice skating, and the like. In my juvenile days our neighborhood used it oftenest of carpenters' shavings. Etymologies suggested for it are curly+cue or queue (cue the last line or tail of a preceding speech, French queue) or perhaps curly+ Q in its script form. J. W. Carr listed curleycu(l)e from Northwestern Arkansas in Dialect Notes,' and later in the same volume, L. W. Payne noted the form with intrusive as occasional in east Alabama.2 All dictionaries now enter curlicue and without a dialect or colloquial label. As for Whitman's variant, the Oxford English Dictionary did not have it in Volume II (1893). For curlicue it had citations from I858, 1872, 1891, these from English works. The OED Supplement (1930), the corrections in which were added in the reissue of the dictionary, supplies citations for curlicue earlier than those of the older Oxford. It quotes from A. Stephens's 'Jon Slick' in High Life in New York (1844): 'A kind of picket fence with curlycues on the side' and 'Then her arms went curlycuing over her head.' Under separate entry and in its alphabetical place the Supplement has carlicue followed by the earliest citation brought to light thus far for either form of the word, this from C. F. Hoffman's Greyslaer (1840). It reads: 'I soon saw, by the way in which the white man's track doubled and doubled again ... that the fellow could not be cutting such carlicues for nothing.' A citation from 1898 reads: 'In Canada . . the English-speaking country people ... often use the word to signify a trifle or thing of little value, I don't care a carlicue, Not worth a carlicue.' The OED Supplement was not, however, the earliest work to chronicle",1,0

"1.1. Dans le domaine de la recherche sur les < faits prosodiques » et en particulier sur l'intonation, on n'en est encore qu'aux premiers balbutiements. En effet, bien que nombre de linguistes aient depuis longtemps souligne l'interet que presenterait une telle etude, il n'existait jusqu'a ces dernieres annees que peu de travaux approfondis sur ces « elements musicaux du langage » reconnus pourtant comme « jouant un role de premier plan э (Ch. Bally, 1932, p. 79). Actuellement l'etude des faits prosodiques connait un regain de faveur pour deux raisons : 1) Le probleme que pose une connaissance insuffisante de leurs fonctions dans l'acte de communication apparait de plus en plus genant pour les linguistes. 2) Le developpement des procedes techniques d'analyse permet d'envisager une telle etude sous un aspect plus rigoureux. Signalons pour memoire les travaux entrepris par differents laboratoires de phonetique : en particulier ceux de l'Institut d'Etudes Linguistiques et Phonetiques de Paris, de l'Institut de Phonetique d'Aix-enProvence, et de l'Institut de Phonetique de Toronto. Toutes ces recherches portent essentiellement sur l'intonation (ou plus exactement sur la courbe melodique, cf. infra ) dont l'etude est menee sur deux plans : une analyse descriptive acoustique et une analyse fonctionnelle qui cherche a etablir une < phonologie » des traits pertinents de l'intonation.",1,0

O texto defende a tese de que a compreensao do processo educacional em ciencias naturais deve transcender a instrumentalizacao do “o que fazer” e do “como fazer”, para abrir espaco para o “quando fazer” e o “por que fazer”. Para dar conta dessa ampliacao do processo educacional necessitamos caracterizar e compreender o cenario das sociedades complexas. Tecemos no presente texto caracterizacao dessa compreensao com a ajuda de Santos (1989; 1997), Giddens (2002), Prigogine (1996), Berstein (2006), Popper (1993) e Bauman (2007).

"For the past ten years or more, most work in the field of Natural Language Generation (NLG) has shied away from considerations regarding the processes underlying human language production. Rather, the focus has been on systems that automatically produce language—usually text—from non-linguistic representations, with the main objective being generation of a text that faithfully captures the meaning of those nonlinguistic representations (see, e.g., Reiter and Dale’s 2000 textbook on NLG). There is, however, also a different take on NLG “as not just competent performance by a computer but the development of a computational theory of the human capacity for language and processes that engage it” (McDonald 1987, page 642). Guhe’s research monograph, based on his 2003 Ph.D. thesis, is firmly situated in the latter tradition. One of his main goals is to work out a computational architecture for Levelt’s (1989) psycholinguistically motivated model of language production. According to Levelt’s model, speaking involves three main activities: conceptualizing (deciding what to say), formulating (deciding how to say it), and articulating (saying it). Guhe’s book focuses on the mental activity of conceptualizing. Conceptualizing is a recalcitrant object of study, partly because of the problem of the “initial spark”; the decision to say something appears to be the result of volitional conscious decisions, which largely elude scientific study. Guhe avoids this problem by investigating conceptualization in settings where the main intention is already fixed: a speaker witnesses several events unfold and is instructed to describe what happens (while it happens). The research challenge then is to figure out how “subintentions” for individual speech acts come about. The benefit of using an on-line generation setting is that it provides information on both what a speaker says at a given point in time and what is being reported, that is, the data that drive the speaker’s utterances. The book consists of the usual preface and introduction, followed by four parts (A, B, C, and Results), a list of the book’s theses, and an appendix that includes, among other things, a glossary, bibliography, name index, and subject index. Part A of the book is titled “Conceptualization.” It starts with an introduction to the field of language production, with particular reference to Levelt’s (1989) model. The notion of conceptualization as a “quasi-module,” partly using Fodor’s (1983) criteria, is presented and four subtasks of conceptualization are discussed:",1,0

"Abstract In this paper, we investigated how Mandarin-speaking children and adults understand the scope relation between the universal quantifier and negation in sentences like Mei-pi ma dou meiyou tiaoguo liba ‘Every horse didn’t jump over the fence’ and Bushi mei-pi ma dou tiaoguo-le liba ‘Not every horse jumped over fence’. We found that Mandarin-speaking children accepted these two types of sentences in both the surface scope and the inverse scope scenarios, whereas Mandarin-speaking adults only permitted them in the surface scope scenarios. The findings of this study, combined with previous research with English-speaking children, invite the conclusion that children start off with a flexible scope relation between the universal quantifier and negation. Children's grammar allows flexibility in the mappings between syntax and semantics.",1,0

"abstract We tested whether the proportion of typical sentences in a series of auditory sentences would lead people to adjust the strength of activation of world knowledge (i.e., retrieval rules adaptation) during comprehension. This issue is important because it could help clarify how people efficiently integrate different memory information in cognitive processes. In two experiments, all task materials were presented to participants as a whole package, in which proportions of typical sentences, with typical final locations, varied under different conditions. In Experiment 1, the proportion of typical sentences was equal to the atypical ones (i.e., 50% typical vs. 50% atypical), whereas in Experiment 2, the proportion of typical sentences was not equal to the atypical ones (i.e., 75% typical vs. 25% atypical, and 25% typical vs. 75% atypical). Visual fixation on the critical area in a visual display before/while hearing the critical words was compared across conditions, and across-condition differences were used as an index of the adaptation of the retrieval rule in the activation of world knowledge. The findings indicated that the adaptation of retrieval rules occurs throughout the whole test package of sentence comprehension, and the strength of activation of world knowledge in sentence comprehension can be adjusted.",1,0

"THE BRAGA VAD GITA (The Blessed One's Song) is the most popu1ar and influential of Hindu religious poems. 1 It is, however, only a small part of the epic Mahabharata (The Great Stories about the Bharatas), which is the longest example of its genre, being about seven times the length of the Iliad and the Odyssey combined. The epic recounts the struggle between two branches of the royal family qf the Bharatas. The ruling branch, the Kauravas, have displaced their cousins, the five Pandava princes, of whom Arjuna is the champion. When all efforts to settle the quarrel peacefully have been exhausted, the Pandavas and the Kauravas meet in an apocalyptic battle. At the end of the fight, all of the Kauravas are destroyed, and of the Pandava host only the five brothers and their cousin Krishna survive. The brothers set out on a pilgrimage to the heaven of the god Indra; one by one they die on the way, only the eldest reaching the goal. There, however, aUthe brothers are united with their supporters and former enemies in a final reconciliation. Like other epics, the Mahabharata uses names in a deliberate and",1,0
"This paper aims to build on some of Jane Hill's contributions to the understanding of indexicality and the creation of an intertextual media series (Hill 2005), as well as to elucidate the varying levels of awareness that speakers have of linguistic features in the circulation of a stereotype. I show how creaky voice, a type of nonmodal phonation, becomes enregistered within an early narrative context, and is then catapulted by centrifugal media forces, taken as part of a constellation of features that cluster around the persona of “hardcore Chicano gangster.” The data presented come from four separate but intricately related sources. One is a narrative of a Chicana girl from Northern California, collected in the 1990s when she was involved in gangs. I also analyze a media-based data set that includes songs about cholos by a Chicano hip hop artist, web-based text and video tutorials on how to act like a cholo, and a representation of a Chicano gangster in the video game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. I explain a mechanism through which a metapragmatically less-than-salient feature can become a semiotic hitchhiker, co-occurring with more overtly ideologized and stereotyped phenomena such as codeswitching and the usage of specific discourse markers. [creaky voice, intertextuality, metapragmatic awareness, enregisterment, Chicanos]",1,0

"Le but de tous les traducteurs est la traduction adéquate et fiable. Pour arriver à ce but il faut non seulement maîtriser parfaitement son lexique, mais comprendre aussi sa structure. Parmi les éléments de la langue on trouve les connecteurs, dont la traduction pose souvent certaines difficultés pour les traducteurs. Le but de cet article est de décrire les connecteurs français, d’analyser leur emploi dans les styles administratif et journalistique ainsi que d’analyser les stratégies de leur traduction en lituanien. Dans la première partie on analyse la définition des connecteurs, leurs fonctions et les particularités linguistiques des styles administratif et journalistique. Cette analyse est largement inspirée par les travaux de J.-M. Adam, E. Roulet, C. Baylon, P. Fabre, J.-P. Vinay, J. Darbelnet et d’autres linguistes. Dans la deuxième partie on analyse la répartition des connecteurs et on fait la comparaison de leurs traductions dans les styles administratif et journalistique. Au total, les 334 exemples des connecteurs étaient trouvés, y compris ceux qui se répètent. Dans le style administratif on a trouvé 72 exemples et le style journalistique en avait 262. Cela montre que les styles déterminent l’emploi des connecteurs. La deuxième partie du travail représente aussi l’analyse de la traduction des connecteurs du français en lituanien. Les résultats permettent de regrouper les exemples trouvés en trois stratégies de la traduction : 1) traduction directe (stratégie grammaticale), 2) traduction par des synonymes (stratégie sémantique), 3) omission des connecteurs (stratégie pragmatique). D’après l’analyse faite on peut constater que c’est la traduction directe qui représente le plus grand nombre des exemples de traduction : 65 % des cas dans le style administratif et 62 % des cas dans le style journalistique. La traduction par des synonymes contextuels fait 20 % dans le style administratif et 26 % dans le style journalistique. Dans les autres cas qui constituent 27 % des exemples trouvés on omet les connecteurs. Cette tendance prouve les différences des structures entre deux langues analysées.",1,0

"This paper explores some of the pros and cons of the proposition that if Greek linguistics (included of course in linguistics generally) is to be taken seriously as a science, then it is not enough to simply ‘confirm/corroborate/verify’ a given theory from a given subset of data. Since corroboration can never ‘prove’ a given theory, we also submit the relevant data to the criteria of falsifiability (Popper 1963). For linguistics, this proceeds by appeal to two kinds of empirical evidence, viz.: a) intuitional (including native speaker assessment surveys as well as corpora analyses), and b) instrumental and other ‘external’ (e.g. acquisition, pathology) studies. All this despite the concession that falsifications can be circumvented (cf. Lakatos 1970); so indeed this paper deals with both the few successful (paradigm-replacing) and the many circumvented (paradigm-internal) falsifications. We begin (in section 2) with falsification-successes that culminated in paradigm-shifts in earlier sciences as well as in contemporary linguistics. We then (in sections 3-4) survey intuitive and experimental cases of falsification circumvention from contemporary linguistics. There we clarify that, although there is reasonable support for abstractions, modifications and unifications, experiments have so far offered only partial or suggestive results. Sections 5-6 sum up and conclude.",1,0

"Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic is the greatest global health threat in over 100 years. Its impact is seen in large numbers of premature deaths and the loss of economic stability for many millions of people. A significant number of people who contract the SARS-CoV-2 virus – the virus that causes COVID disease – experience symptoms many months after their acute illness. So-called Long COVID is now a recognized condition, with many affected individuals unable to return to work and engage in other daily activities. Among the complex symptoms of this condition is “brain fog”, a constellation of cognitive-linguistic problems that manifest as forgetfulness, word-finding difficulty, a lack of attention and concentration, and problems engaging in conversation. In this paper, I examine two women who had moderate COVID-19 infection during the first wave of the pandemic in Belgium and the UK. Both participants reported cognitive-linguistic difficulties several months after first becoming unwell. The UK participant is a native English speaker while the participant in Belgium speaks English as a second language. Case studies are used to examine their pre-morbid functioning and lifestyle, the onset and course of their COVID illness, and its impact on their language skills. It is argued that Long COVID has the potential to disrupt pragmatic and discourse skills even as structural language skills are intact. As such, this condition requires further systematic study by clinical linguists and speech-language pathologists.",1,0

"The two Algic languages of California, Wiyot and Yurok, have comparable external sandhi patterns whereby initial h surfaces as l after certain preverbs. We argue that h ⇒ l sandhi in each language originated by the reanalysis of final l in certain preverbs after the presence of l had become opaque. The former presence of l in these preverbs is shown by other internal evidence and Algonquian comparison. Despite the similarity of the sandhi patterns, we conclude that they do not support the hypothesis that the California languages form a subgroup within Algic.",1,0

"In our introduction to the volume, we address the history and current developments in Uralic studies, with particular attention to the evolution of grammar-writing since the very first Uralic grammars until today, and summarize some of the most interesting Uralic phenomena from a typological point of view. In Section 2 we show that, even though Uralic studies can boast a remarkable number of linguistic studies and a rich production of descriptive grammars, the published grammars often lack in comparability (as they use different terms to describe the same phenomena), international reach and they often are not typologically informed. Therefore, we advocate for a stronger cooperation between typology and Uralic studies. In Section 3 we present the papers included in this special edition of ESUKA, a selection of typologically-informed, data-driven and terminologically consistent studies of different phenomena in a number of Uralic languages. Finally, in Section 4 we present a short overview of some typologically relevant features in Uralic languages.",1,0

"This study explores the indicative vs. subjunctive alternation in Spanish subordinate clauses following epistemic adverbials and expressions of possibility. Anchored in semantic-pragmatic and variationist theoretical frameworks, traditional research on mood alternation in Spanish remains largely experimental in nature. In contrast, we adopt a corpus-based multifactorial methodology to investigate 4,199 occurrences of fourteen expressions of possibility extracted from the Corpus del Español (e.g. caso de que , poder ser que , por si acaso , posiblemente , etc.) annotated contextually for structural, semantic and stylistic variables. Methodologically, we conduct an exploratory multiple correspondence analysis followed by a confirmatory binary logistic regression to examine whether/how the linguistic contexts affect mood variation. Overall, the results indicate that previously unexplored semantic factors (such as the inherent lexical aspect of verbs in subordinate clauses) significantly influence mood variation in Spanish. Ultimately, our results suggest that subjunctive uses are less uniform and more prone to internal variation than indicative uses.",1,0

It is a highly timely contribution that lls a gap between the pre-theoret- ical notion of ‘mixed metaphors’, largely known to the (English-speaking) pub- lic as something to be avoided as it re ects poor style or even sloppy thinking, and scholarly research on metaphor, where the topic has received little attention. In the Introduction, Gibbs discusses the example the city’s proposal to skim the frosting, pocket the cake, and avoid paying the fair, reasonable value for the meal is hound that will not hunt, and proposes that such metaphor mixing should not be viewed negatively, but rather as a natural reflection of “people’s cognitive flexibility to think of abstract concepts in a myriad of metaphorical ways” (p. vii).

抽象 本文通過三種語法現象來觀察晉語對元白話語法的繼承和發展。1.「來」表商請語氣：古代漢語、近代漢語中「來」表商請語氣的主要句式為「VP+去+來」，部分晉語繼承了元白話的用法，並發展了「咱每+VP+來」格式。2.「V/A+得來+補語」結構與提頓詞「來」：元白話用「V/A+得來+補語」結構表達動作的結果和性狀達到極高的程度，晉語不僅保留了這種格式，還同吳語一樣發展出了「V/A+得來」的隱含式。晉語之所以能夠發展出「V/A+得來+補語」結構，其更大的背景是「來」大量充當提頓詞的用法。3.「V將來/去」結構：晉語的特點是趨向動詞只有「來、去」，甚或只有「來」，沒有「V+將+複合趨向補語」，保留了元代乃至五代時期的特點。4. 其他語法特點：用表格形式臚列了 9 條晉語與元白話可能存在繼承關係的語法現象，同 《原本老乞大》 進行簡單對比。,1,0

"During four decades of membership in the American Name Society, I have witnessed the maturing of onomastic studies in the United States and enjoyed the privilege of associating with the pioneers of our discipline. The society has provided scholarly growth, collegial friendships, and exciting involvement in onomastics. My introduction to the American Name Society came from Dr. Lili Rabel-Heymann, one of my graduate professors of linguistics at Louisiana State University. She described the stimulating activities of the society and gave me an application for membership. Upon completion of doctoral studies and my return to teaching at East Texas State University, I attended my first meeting of the American Name Society in Washington D.C., .in 1960. The society was completing its first decade when I became a member. The papers-on fascinating topicswere enthralling, but the opportunity to be in the same banquet hall with legendary founders of the society was awesome. Elsdon Smith, Margaret Bryant, Allen Walker Read, Frederic Cassidy, Francis Utley, Kelsie Harder, Leonard Ashley-all names I recognized from their published scholarship-were there. And they carried on genuine conversations and showed interest in a starry~eyed y()ung Texan. Later, I would work on various ANS projects and develop friendships with Lurline Coltharp, Donald Orth, W. F. H. Nicolaisen, Audrey Duckert, Ed Ehrensperger, Wallace McMullen, Byrd Granger, Grace Alvarez-Altman, John Algeo, Lewis McArthur, Alan Rayburn, Clarence Barnhart, Robert Barnhart, Raven and Virginia McDavid, and other outstanding names scholars, and at a meeting in San Francisco, I would meet George Stewart, whose Names on the Land had fired my imagination in graduate school.",1,0

"This study investigates how discourse particles and intonation contribute to the modification of speech act. In particular, it focuses on the interplay between the speaker’s and the addressee’s commitment toward the proposition in assertions, biased questions, and requests for confirmation. A syntactic analysis is proposed, in which speaker commitment and call on addressee are represented as two functional projections of the speech act structure. Data from nontonal (Canadian English) and tonal languages (Cantonese and Medumba) are analyzed for cross-linguistic comparison. In Canadian English, the particle “ eh ” and rising intonation are associated with speaker commitment and call on addressee, respectively. In Cantonese, a single particle associates with these. In Medumba, the two positions are occupied by two distinct particles. This neo-performative approach toward speech act structure differs from Ross’s 1970 original insight by positing a high functional layer called grounding , rather than a higher matrix clause of the familiar type.",1,0

"Null Subjects, Switch-Reference, and Serialization in Jabêm and Numbami Joel Bradshaw Abstract Analysis of null vs. overt subject NPs over successive clauses in texts from Numbami and Jabêm, two Austronesian languages of Papua New Guinea with rich subject-agreement morphology and rich verb serialization, reveals that optional null subjects normally signal subject retention across clauses while optional overt subjects signal switches. Comparison of these discourse-level switch-reference systems with clause-level verb serialization in the same languages, and with morphological switch-reference systems in neighboring Papuan languages and distant Austronesian languages reveals considerable functional overlap between canonical switch-reference systems and canonical verb-serialization systems, but with null subject NPs signaling similar types of continuity in both systems. Optional null subjecthood marks not just subject continuity across successive clauses at the discourse level, but also actor continuity, just as obligatory null subjecthood on noninitial verbs marks continuity of actors, patients, and other thematic roles across successive serialized verbs at the clause level. 1. Introduction. This study examines the occurrences of null vs. overt initial subject NPs in successive clauses in texts from Jabêm and Numbami, two Austronesian languages of Morobe Province, Papua New Guinea. Both languages are SVO and have rich and uniform systems of prefixes that uniquely identify the person and number of the subject of each verb. Null subjects in clause-initial position are thus very common and normally signal retention of the subject (and actor) of the prior clause, while overt subject NPs signal a switch in clausal subject (and actor). That much is fairly easy to demonstrate, but the analysis is complicated by two intersecting phenomena. (1) Both languages are especially rich in serial verb constructions (SVCs) that allow SVC-internal subject-agreement switches between successive verbs. Like other clause types, Numbami and Jabêm SVCs allow subject NPs to be either overt or null in initial position, but allow no other overt subjects anywhere else in the same clause. Each succeeding verb in an SVC can introduce a new thematic [End Page 270] role (patient, goal, location) in object NP position, but it cannot place a competing entity in a role already assigned earlier in the clause. Thus, a null-subject sequence such as 'we-carry taro we-carry bananas' (with pronominal prefixes here signaling subject agreement) cannot be analyzed as a single SVC-despite actor continuity- because it contains two competing patients ('taro' and 'bananas'). The same goes for 'we-carry food we-go inland we-go seaward', because it contains two competing goals-of-motion. But 'we-carry food we-go we-put it-lie house-inside' is a fine SVC because the whole sequence shows continuity of actor ('we'), patient ('food'), and location ('house-inside')-as well as continuity of tense, polarity, illocutionary force, and so forth. (2) Both Numbami and Jabêm have long been in contact with Papuan languages that have canonical switch-reference (SR) systems that morphologically mark subject continuity (ss) and discontinuity (ds) in the medial verbs of clause chains. Such clause chains may sometimes show levels of cohesion that approximate those of SVCs. In fact, some SVCs and clause chains are close translation equivalents. Attention is thus devoted to sorting out the differences among tracking subject relationships within SVCs, within SR clause chains, and within stretches of independent clauses.1 1.1 Data Sources. Jabêm (sometimes spelt Yabem or Yabim) is already among the best-recorded languages in Melanesia. Dempwolff (1939) undertook a grammatical description as his last publication. Zahn (1940) provides a thorough pedagogical grammar, with abundant exemplification. Zahn earlier produced a (1917) Jabêm-German dictionary, and Streicher has produced both a (1937) German-Jabêm dictionary and a (1982) Jabêm-English dictionary. Since Jabêm was a church and mission-school lingua franca used since the turn of the century throughout Austronesian-speaking areas of Morobe Province, there are also abundant materials in the language: primers, texts about a variety of traditional and modern customs and scientific beliefs, historical accounts of World War II, traditional and biblical tales, hymnals and liturgy, the entire New Testament and most of the Old Testament (Streicher 1982:657-658).

According to D'Souza (1999) the question of standard English ‘is one of the great, unresolved problems that we are carrying into the twenty-first century’ (p. 271). Why should this question be so important and why so unresolved? And what does the book under review here add to our possible understanding of this issue? There are a number of significant issues here. First, there is the question of definition: what is a standard language? From this follows the ontological question as to whether they actually exist or are merely convenient (or inconvenient) fictions. Are we talking about spoken or written language? And in the global context, there are questions such as whether a global standard of international English exists or is emerging? Or is international intelligibility always a negotiation of possibilities with no obvious standard? And how do the new standard Englishes of Singapore, India, or Hong Kong relate both to all the other forms of English within those countries and to the other regionalized standards as well as the possible international standard? From definitional questions we move on to more political and pedagogical ones: Are standard languages hegemonic forms to be opposed? Are standard languages hegemonic forms to be acquired? Does access to standard language give people greater social and economic mobility, or is this another myth associated with standard languages?",1,0

"In the past two decades, neuroimaging investigations of stuttering have led to important discoveries of structural and functional brain differences in people who stutter, providing significant clues to the neurological basis of stuttering. One major limitation, however, has been that most studies so far have only examined adults who stutter, whose brain and behavior likely would have adopted compensatory reactions to their stuttering; these confounding factors have made interpretations of the findings difficult. Developmental stuttering is a neurodevelopmental condition, and like many other neurodevelopmental disorders, stuttering is associated with an early childhood onset of symptoms and greater incidence in males relative to females. More recent studies have begun to examine children who stutter using various neuroimaging techniques that allow examination of functional neuroanatomy and interaction of major brain areas that differentiate children who stutter compared with age-matched controls. In this article, I review these more recent neuroimaging investigations of children who stutter, in the context of what we know about typical brain development, neuroplasticity, and sex differences relevant to speech and language development. Although the picture is still far from complete, these studies have potential to provide information that can be used as early objective markers, or prognostic indicators, for persistent stuttering in the future. Furthermore, these studies are the first steps in finding potential neural targets for novel therapies that may involve modulating neuroplastic growth conducive to developing and maintaining fluent speech, which can be applied to treatment of young children who stutter.",1,0

Особливу увагу акцентовано на кількісно найбільшій групі назв із східнороманськими формальними ознаками, що постали способом онімізації відповідних географічних апелятивів (а також загальновживаних лексем на позначення розміру, форми чи інших якісних ознак гідрооб’єкта) або трансонімізації суміжних топонімів (мікротопонімів, оронімів), похідних від лексем із переважно географічною семантикою.

Para ello, se realizó un estudio mixto de corte transversal de alcance descriptivo, sobre la base de una muestra no probabilística, en el que se aplicaron dos instrumentos: una prueba de comprensión lectora (Lectum 7) y un protocolo de pensamiento en voz alta. Los resultados revelan un desempeño promedio general bajo, con una comparación de lectores hábiles y menos hábiles que arroja una diferencia significativa en cuanto a nivel de comprensión lectora, y una comparación entre estudiantes con y sinestudios superiores previos favorable a los primeros. Además, se observa una diferencia en la eficacia con la que se emplean estrategias de comprensión lectora, que muestra una mayor reflexión por parte de los lectores hábiles. Finalmente, es posible concluir que el empleo de estrategias y la experiencia con distintos tipos de texto son factores que inciden en el desempeño lector.",1,0
"Abstract During the coronavirus pandemic, online education continued to expand across varied educational factors. Therefore, the teachers had to develop and change some of the strategies used in their classes previously. Online classroom management is a synchronous-based online learning environment in education that is worthwhile to modify. For this purpose, the current study sought to understand the perceptions of classroom management and teaching self-efficacy by Iranian EFL teachers during the Covid-19 pandemic. Concerning sampling, 100 male and female English teachers constituted the study sample. Data were collected via Online Teaching Self–Efficacy Inventory questionnaire through different online platforms. The findings reflected that EFL teachers could select appropriate classroom management during online and face-to-face classes. In addition, the teachers had a positive attitude toward managing the classroom during the Covid-19 pandemic. The implications of this study may open up new perspectives into successful pedagogy for, teachers and students in outbreak days.",1,0

"The verb lexicon can be classified in different and complementary ways; each approach faces challenges and limits. We focus on two large-scale lexical resources, WordNet (Miller et al. 1990; Fellbaum 1998) and FrameNet (Baker et al. 2003). WordNet is a semantic network where lexical meaning is represented in terms of relations among word forms. In contrast to WordNet's paradigmatically organized entries, FrameNet's Lexical Units are embedded in corpus-derived contexts, which serve as a basis for semantic distinctions. The classificatory perspective that each resource contributes to the analysis of the verb lexicon is illustrated with specific examples. Constructing verb typologies, even when based on attested data, requires the lexicographer's introspection and judgments, and no two classifications are completely alike. In a case-based approach to compare and harmonize WordNet and FrameNet, we ask human annotators to select the context-appropriate senses from each resources that best fit tokens in a corpus. A typology of alignments is proposed.",1,0

"Introduction papers in this volume expand our general knowledge about attrition and are helpful to practitioners and curriculum developers in Russian programs. They describe attrition among Russian speakers who live outside of Russia, or more precisely the Russian diaspora in the United States and Finland. This question is of much importance to the newly emergent field of heritage teaching, i.e., teaching students whose language acquisition begins in the home, as opposed to foreign acquisition which, ... is usually begun in a classroom setting (Heritage Language Research Priorities Conference Report 2000). While the authors are interested in the linguistic aspects of attrition, there is widespread interest of a more practical nature. We teachers have been trying to determine what we need to know to inform heritage-language teaching, textbook writing, and teacher preparation. In the field of Russian linguistics today only a few scholars have researched emigre Russian. In addition to the four contributors to this volume, the most notable are Zemskaya and Glovinskaya (2001), and in Russian-specific pedagogical research we can name Andrews (2000), Bermel and Kagan (2000), Kagan and Dillon (2001, 2006), and Kagan (2005). current volume covers a number of themes, such as the contemporary norm in spoken Russian as it manifests itself in Russia and in immigration (Andrews), the grammatical and lexical features of American Russian (Polinsky), attrition in children's due to emigration (Schmitt), and loss and retention of certain grammatical features in a particular strand of Finnish Russian (Leisio). Three papers deal with immigration from Russian-speaking countries to the United States over the last thirty years (1970-2000), while the fourth paper addresses attrition and retention of grammatical forms over several generations as spoken by descendants of Russians who migrated to Finland about 200 years ago. I will briefly comment on each of the papers, starting with David Andrews's discussion of the contemporary norm. question of the norm brings to mind a personal anecdote. When I arrived in the United States in the mid-seventies, I would occasionally run into Russians who emigrated after the revolution of 1917. I thought their Russian was beautiful, if slightly quaint. They, however, found my educated Moscow Russian inelegant, jarring to the ear, and worst of all ... Soviet. In the mid-nineties when I visited Moscow, I was surprised by people telling me that my Russian was beautiful and better than their own. At the same time, I noted some new expressions and intonations with curiosity but without affection, as they were somewhat inelegant and jarring to my ear. Had my own personal norm, native as it no doubt still was, become obsolete and fossilized? That question acquires special significance when I am faced with teaching heritage students of Russian who came to the United States much later than I did and thus may have grown up using a norm that I am not aware of. In Russian programs across the U.S. we now have a considerable population of heritage speakers. In addition to teaching them literacy and culture, we generally approach their as needing correction and improvement because it does not correspond to the norm. David Andrews in his article The Role of Emigre Russian in Redefining the Standard challenges this position, asking whether there is a norm and whether there can be one in a country that has fallen apart and is still pulling its economic, cultural, and intellectual life together. For example, the growing use of the preposition o that Andrews mentions is jarring to the ear of a native speaker and teacher like myself, who left the country thirty years ago. Is it incorrect? Or is it an emerging norm? When Andrews mentions changes in intonation or the use of English borrowings, these are exactly the areas where we try to make our heritage students change their linguistic behavior. …",1,0

Le développement du gallo-romain vers ce que l’on qualifie aujourd’hui de langue française a été conditionné par un trait prosodique particulier, inconnu dans les autres langues romanes. L’oxytonisation est un processus évolutif qu’a subi le système linguistique français à partir du VIe siècle. Elle consiste à réduire la ou les syllabes post-accentuelles en fixant l’accent sur la dernière syllabe de l’unité accentuelle. La conséquence principale de ce processus est la formation de l’unité accentuelle, identifiable comme le syntagme. L’oxytonisation a engendré quelques spécificités essentielles du système linguistique français. Certaines formes substantivales et verbales ne pouvaient plus développer leur flexion sur les syllabes post-accentuelles. La détermination du nombre nominal et de la personne du verbe s’est déplacée à l’avant de la forme lexicale. En français oral, le nombre du nom est déterminé par la qualité de la voyelle, formant le noyau syllabique de l’article et d’autres déterminants, et non par la forme lexicale elle-même. Une situation analogue s’observe dans la flexion du paradigme verbal à l’indicatif présent du singulier : l’oxytonisme annule la possibilité du marquage personnel sur les terminaisons et provoque un isomorphisme dans la prononciation des trois formes verbales de base. Le marquage de la personne est revenu aux indices personnels ou pronominaux je/tu/il en fonction de constituant sujet qui en fait n’ont pas de propriétés pronominales et fonctionnent comme des morphèmes proclitiques.",1,0
"The idea of having a version of the IPA chart in Chinese was initiated by a group of Chinese phoneticians and dialectologists in 2006. The situation that existed at the time was that the IPA terms used in mainstream Chinese textbooks and in classrooms were still following various older versions of the chart and principles. For instance, there were no approximants in the consonant chart; instead, the Chinese translation of the term ‘frictionless continuant’ was still listed in the consonant chart. After the revised IPA chart was released in 2005, Chinese phoneticians and dialectologists considered it a good opportunity to promote the updated IPA terminology in Chinese, reflected in a Chinese version of the chart. In the winter of 2006, the Phonetic Association of China organized an advisory committee and a working committee to undertake the translation. Following some months of e-mail communications among committee members, a meeting was organized at the Institute of Linguistics, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, on 7 January 2007. Five members of the advisory committee and seven members of the working committee participated in the final discussion. At the meeting in Beijing, we worked out the 2007 version of the IPA chart in Chinese that is reproduced here. This chart was first published in the first issue of the Chinese journal Fangyan 方 言 [Dialect] in 2007. The copyright symbol at the top of the chart indicates that the Chinese version is a work of the Phonetic Association of China, which is, officially speaking, a member of the Linguistic Society of China. The intention of the Association in disseminating the chart has been to unify and clarify the traditions of Chinese phonetic usage, to standardize Chinese terminology for referring to speech sounds and categories, and to communicate and promote the knowledge of IPA practices to Chinese-speaking society.",1,0
"ion a permis de distinguer la structure du vers de sa realisation phonique individuelle, avec laquelle elle est confondue dans l'ecole acoustique (Lote, Spire, la phonostylistique).

"In the first part, the study presents a brief characteristics of the development of the Modern High German language after 1650 from the point of view how other languages influenced its vocabulary and analyses numerous loan words. The second part deals with the origins and the first activities of the General German Language Society (from 1885 on) which became the leader in the field of the institutionalised ideological fight against foreign words in the central German language area. The third part introduces the research results of the affiliate societies which were founded in Moravia, one of the part of the Lands of the Bohemian Crown. Both the information in the journal of the General German Language Society and archive documents in three Moravian archives (in Brno, Jihlava and Nový Jičín – the only Moravian cities where affiliate societies were founded) show that their existence was rather a peripheral issue in these cities. As opposed to this, affiliated societies were very active in the cities of northern Bohemia. At the end of the study, the author considers the reasons which caused this kind of situation in Moravia.",1,0

"En el año 1806 el académico andaluz Joaquín Juan Flores presenta a la Real Academia Española un dictamen en el que expone su plan para la reforma de la ortografía española, un interesante texto que, a pesar de la repercusión que tuvo en su época en el seno de esta institución, ha pasado inadvertido para los estudios historiográficos sobre la rae y los debates sobre la reforma ortográfica de nuestra lengua. Los objetivos concretos de este trabajo se centran en: a) analizar el contenido de este dictamen y de los votos que los distintos académicos desarrollaron a partir de él; b) indagar en los argumentos esgrimidos por los académicos a favor o en contra de las reformas; c) examinar las decisiones adoptadas por la rae al hilo de todas las propuestas, y d) estudiar su alcance y trascendencia en las publicaciones académicas posteriores, especialmente, la octava edición de la Ortografía de 1815.

"What influences how people render their moral judgment? Focusing specifically on the conceptual metaphors “ moral is upright ” and “ immoral is tilted ”, we sought to investigate whether physical slant can influence people’s harsh moral judgment. Experiment 1 induced physical slant by having participants complete the questionnaire at a tilt table. We observed a significant effect with participants who experienced physical slant rendering a less severe moral judgment than did those who wrote their responses at a level table. Using a new manipulation of physical slant and a larger, more diverse sample, Experiment 2 asked participants to complete the questionnaires with rotated text or normal text. We observed a difference between the two groups: compared to participants who read the normal text, those with a visual experience of slant lessened the severity of their moral judgments. Taken together, the results showed that the consequence of tilted experience exerts downstream effects on moral reasoning, which suggests that incidental bodily experience affects how people render their decisions.",1,0

"A significant part of the debate over the practice of “good” linguistic typology is concerned with the issue of methodology that can produce generalizations at a satisfactory depth based on a satisfactory sample size. As the articles in this collection themselves attest, there is no single goal for typology: the inventory of possible human language structures, variation within a phenomenon, the diffusion of particular phenomena, areal patterns, as well as the stability of linguistic phenomena over time are just a sampling of the concerns which typologists have had. Even given such diverse goals – where methodological differences might be take for granted as necessary – the debate over typological methodology persists.",1,0

"A number of collections of papers from the field of natual language generation (NLG) have been published over the last few years: Kempen (1987), Zock and Sabah (1988), Dale, Mellish, and Zock (1990), and now the present volume. All have in common that they are derived in one way or another from workshops on the subject, and should therefore make available new and often exploratory research in a timely fashion. If such a book is to be more than a conference proceedings, it has to do a little more too, of course; it should present the research in more detail than a conference proceedings would, there should be greater cohesion amongst the papers, and it should be produced to an appropriate standard. The present book, like its predecessors, succeeds on some counts but fails on others. The papers in the book are organized into three strands, described in turn below: Text planning, lexical choice, and grammatical resources. The balance between these is rather skewed, however: the first section contains eight papers, and the second and third contain only three papers each.",1,0

"The origins of the Afro-Hispanic Languages of the Americas (AHLAs), the languages that developed in Latin America from the contact of African languages and Spanish in colonial times, are extremely intriguing, since it still has to be explained why we do not find creole languages in certain regions of Spanish America, where the socio-demographic conditions for creole languages to emerge appear to have been in place in colonial times. Nowadays, in contrast, we can find such contact varieties in similar former colonies, which were ruled by the British, the French or the Dutch ( McWhorter 2000 ). Despite the fascinating implications of this phenomenon, our knowledge of the AHLAs remains extremely limited. Several hypotheses have been proposed to account for this situation, but no common consensus has yet been achieved ( Chaudenson 2001 ; Mintz 1971 ; Laurence 1974 ; Granda 1968 ; Schwegler 1993 , 2014 ; Lipski 1993 ; etc.). The pull of different views on the issue has been labelled in the literature as the ‘Spanish creole debate’ ( Lipski 2005 : ch.9). The current study is aimed at casting new light on the Spanish creole debate by relying on a comparative analysis of slave laws in the Americas. This article highlights the role that legal differences played in shaping colonial societies and the Afro-European languages that developed in the New World.",1,0

"This paper examines the function of the mosque in Leila Aboulela’s fiction, focusing mainly on Minaret. To realize this goal, the study elucidates the forms of materialism that burden the world of Minaret, demonstrating how this world is pulled between two conflicting material ideologies that paralyze Najwa, the protagonist. The eventual malfunctioning of these two ideological paradigms is gradually neutralized (through Najwa’s experience) by the spiritual power accorded to her through the mosque. Najwa’s spiritual transformation takes place over a long period of being intermittently touched by mystical sparks that make her self-conscious of a deeply buried spiritual space in her personality, which has been detrimentally marginalized by the materialistic ideologies governing her former lifestyle. The mosque’s spiritual function is further stressed in the way Aboulela disconnects the mosque’s spirituality from any physicality. When the mosque is shown to have any spiritual effects, its corporeal value ceases to exist. Keywords: Leila Aboulela; Minaret; the Mosque; Spirituality; Materialism.",1,0

"Abstract Clearly articulated speech, relative to plain-style speech, has been shown to improve intelligibility. We examine if visible speech cues in video only can be systematically modified to enhance clear-speech visual features and improve intelligibility. We extract clear-speech visual features of English words varying in vowels produced by multiple male and female talkers. Via a frame-by-frame image-warping based video generation method with a controllable parameter (displacement factor), we apply the extracted clear-speech visual features to videos of plain speech to synthesize clear speech videos. We evaluate the generated videos using a robust, state of the art AI Lip Reader as well as human intelligibility testing. The contributions of this study are: (1) we successfully extract relevant visual cues for video modifications across speech styles, and have achieved enhanced intelligibility for AI; (2) this work suggests that universal talker-independent clear-speech features may be utilized to modify any talker’s visual speech style; (3) we introduce “displacement factor” as a way of systematically scaling the magnitude of displacement modifications between speech styles; and (4) the high definition generated videos make them ideal candidates for human-centric intelligibility and perceptual training studies.",1,0

"Salvador Espriu's Antigona (1969) is an auto-reflexive tragic drama in which the classical concept of anagnorisis mirrors a dynamics of political recognition outside the play; that is, the contexts of the Spanish Civil War and the postwar periods. The correlation between anagnorisis and political recognition places into question the polis in the Greek tragedy and the State in the historical contexts it mirrors. In exploring the ways in which, in this Catalan Antigone, political recognition is tied to the (im)possibility of justice, as (mis)recognition, I consider (1) how anagnorisis as a form of recognition manifests itself in Espriu's Antigona; (2) how different forms of silence permeate the text: the imposed silence on the citizens of Thebes, as well as the silence that is related with distance and detachment, both of which render impossible an ethical and epistemological position associated with justice as a form of political recognition outside the rule of law; (3) the ways Antigone not only is the be...",1,0

"Editorial Edward Finegan THIS ISSUE OF DICTIONARIES OPENS WITH AN ARTICLE THAT contrasts the differing marketing practices in British and American dictionary publishing and how those practices both reflect and support quite different dictionary cultures. Lynne Murphy argues that more than commercial competitiveness distinguishes American and British dictionary cultures—and that US competitiveness isn’t couched merely as among dictionaries but as among potential dictionary buyers. Focusing on Oxford University Press and Merriam-Webster, Murphy sees the larger cultural differences as rooted “in differing attitudes to the roles for written authority in each culture.” In another article, Elizabeth Knowles describes a different kind of publishing phenomenon. She traces the development of the relatively recent publishing area of dictionary histories, beginning with Mary Wright’s biography of her husband, Joseph Wright, editor of the English Dialect Dictionary. Knowles discusses half a dozen other histories, including Elisabeth Murray’s portrait of her uncle, James Murray, and his role as editor of the Oxford English Dictionary, and Peter Gilliver’s history of the making of the OED. In a refrain echoed elsewhere in this issue, Knowles observes “a trend towards seeing particular dictionaries in terms of their social and cultural importance.” In the third article, Anne Dykstra focuses his attention on the hypothesized link between Frisian and English posited by Joost Halbertsma and implemented in entries to his Lexicon Frisicum, completed and published by his son in 1872. Dykstra argues that Halbertsma could have done more in his dictionary to support his hypothesis but that, in the end, his lexicographical practice failed to be as persuasive as it might have been. [End Page vii] In the Reference Works in Progress section, Jack Bowers and Laurent Romary, both active participants in the refinement of the Text Encoding Initiative, describe the complexities of creating a dictionary of Mixtepec-Mixtec and amply illustrate their application of TEI to an under-resourced language. They map out how to accommodate unique combinations of features not familiar in descriptions of Indo-European languages and thus model the utility of TEI for other projects seeking to enrich language resources for indigenous languages of the Americas and elsewhere. This issue of Dictionaries contains reviews of six books, ranging from the highly popular to the deeply scholarly. Drawing on her own vast experience working with diverse dictionary publishers, Wendalyn Nichols reviews Kory Stamper’s Word by Word and finds it both fascinating and elegiac; “a singular delight” was discovering “how much [the book] captured of her own experience.” Orin Hargraves reviews Lynne Murphy’s The Prodigal Tongue, a popular treatment of British-American language differences, “chock-full of insight and solid research about matters … that show marked and rather complicated differences between the two language communities.” He writes that “no other writer on dialectal differences in English can match Murphy’s ability to helpfully place observations about usage in their linguistic, social, cultural, and historical context.” Hargraves also reviews Paul Baker’s American and British English, a more technical treatment based on analysis of the Brown family of corpora. The book’s “highly focused subject matter and somewhat problematic approach to it” will be of less interest to the lexicographer and general reader than those “undertaking examination of corpora for computational purposes,” Hargraves says. Three other reviews focus principally on historical aspects of lexicography. Elizabeth Knowles reviews the collection of “prefatory pieces to dictionaries published between the early seventeenth and the early nineteenth centuries,” edited by Rebecca Shapiro. While today’s dictionary user pays little attention to prefatory matter, Knowles writes that “Shapiro makes a strong case for matters having been different in the period covered by Fixing Babel.” In his review of The Place of Words, by Michael P. Fitzsimmons, Peter Sokolowski notes that dictionary users want practicality rather than theory: “they are seeking the authority of a dictionary … for answers to questions about words.” He characterizes The Place of Words as an [End Page viii] exploration “into the many intersections of politics and language” as related to the Académie Française and its dictionary during an “Age of Revolution.” The book’s story, Sokolowski says, is one that “resonates today with the popular view that the Académie’s...",1,0

"This article outlines the current challenges inherent in the disjuncture between language in education policy and policy implementation in South Africa and offers some perspectives on existing opportunities for addressing these challenges. Factors alienating young people from valuable opportunities for meaningful self-expression within existing educational structures are, among others, externally imposed norms and standards, the continued low status of African languages, misapplications of the prevailing Western “culture of reading,” and failure to address linguistic diversity overtly in the classroom, at the community level, and in the wider political context. Failure to acquire literacies which may enable youth to participate meaningfully in the ever-widening neo-capitalist economic global context lays them open to exploitation. Insights into the kinds of initiatives on the ground, such as tapping multiliteracies and multimodal engagement, hold great promise for more equitable participation of the youth and go a long way toward putting structures in place to curb the downward literacy spiral. In conclusion, without radical structural transformation and opportunities for equitable recognition and exchange of resources between mainstream and currently marginal populations, “accommodations” and “add on” paradigms of diversity will be perpetuated. These lack the moral imperative for effecting meaningful change in educational practices.",1,0

"This book re-examines research on women’s and men’s use of politeness in a critical way, calling attention to a number of problems related with the application by these studies of Brown & Levinson’s model (1978, 1987). In contrast to the view of politeness as the performance of specific speech acts that has expanded from the establishment of this framework, the author proposes a more interactional perspective on the issue that takes into account both the speaker’s production and the hearer’s reception of the utterances, on the basis of a conception of politeness as a judgement of the interactants. From the development of this new perspective, Mills critically reviews studies on women’s and men’s use of politeness, trying to show the problems that arise in the interpretation of data as a result of the application of Brown and Levinson’s model. Likewise, drawing on the performative theoretical perspective that most language and gender researchers are currently advocating, the author maintains that the contention commonly defended by these studies that ‘women are more polite’ than men, is more based on a stereotypical view of ‘women’s language’ than on actual women’s linguistic behaviour. The structure of the book can be described as composed of two main parts, if we exclude the introductory and conclusive sections. In the first part, which comprises three chapters, the text focuses on a critical re-examination of Brown and Levinson’s model of politeness, beginning with a rethinking about the way many linguists in general put the speaker implicitly (and, in some cases, even explicitly) at the centre of attention in their analyses of data. Thus, considering her/him as an autonomous person who consciously chooses to use certain language items and strategies rather than others, and assuming that they can unequivocally determine which are the intentions of their productions. This initial chapter (“Rethinking linguistic interpretation”) is important to the extent that establishes the basis of the criticism directed at Brown and Levinson’s model of politeness that the author develops subsequently. In the following two chapters (“Theorizing politeness” and “Politeness and impoliteness”), Mills makes this model problematic because of its assumption that certain speech acts are intrinsically polite (or impolite), and that these are unequivocally used by speakers to show concern or deference by others (or, on the contrary, to be ‘unfriendly’ or ‘disrespectful’). In contrast to this perspective, the author maintains that, instead of assuming that politeness can be objectively found in specific speaker’s productions, we should also take into account the hearer’s ESTUDIOS DE SOCIOLINGUISTICA",1,0

"Balance is a key component to the assessment of concussion injury; however, the efficacies of clinical tests used are currently under debate. It is questionable whether currently accepted methods of standing balance assessment quantify balance disturbances sufficiently to support decisions on recovery and return to play. Recent evidence of balance abnormalities postconcussion that linger beyond the typical 3- to 5-day recovery period support arguments that currently available standing balance tests are not sensitive enough to determine recovery of function. This article discusses the current clinical tests used in the assessment of concussion in adults and their limitations and the evidence supporting continued balance dysfunction. Implications for the future of balance assessment in concussed adults and recommendations to clinicians for best practices are presented.",1,0

"The article draws on 575 randomly selected articles from the South African Media database to explore the representation of Zimbabwean women migrants. Using critical discourse analysis (CDA), the article shows that some of the dominant construction types depict a picture of caricatured, stereotypical and stigmatised Zimbabwean migrant women without voice and individuality. In turn, the diversity of their actualities is not captured in the process of constructing the twin images of Zimbabwean women as victims and as purveyors of decadent and other negative social ills in society. We conclude that Zimbabwean women migrants appear in the SA media primarily in three negative images: suppliers of sexual services, as un-motherly, and as victims. We also conclude that there is need for media to capture the voices of migrant women recounting their everyday lived experiences in different political and socio-economic contexts in order to account for the migrant women’s voices of resilience, defiance and victimhood and of agency, against the normalising and marginalising influences of political institutions and national border controls. This would also help capture the transformative nature of migration to the women, the ‘home’ in Zimbabwe and the ‘home’ in South Africa.",1,0

"Eurobarometer survey on Europeans and their languagesThe Special Eurobarometer (386) survey on 'Europeans and Their Languages' was carried out in spring 2012. Almost 27,000 people were interviewed face-toface in their mother tongue. All 27 Member States were covered and those taking part represented different social and demographic groups. The key findings set out in the executive summary are:- In accordance with the EU population, the most widely spoken mother tongue is German (16%), followed by Italian and English (13% each), French (12%), then Spanish and Polish (8% each).- For the majority of Europeans their mother tongue is one of the official languages of the country in which they reside.- Just over half of Europeans (54%) are able to hold a conversation in at least one additional language, a quarter (25%) are able to speak at least two additional languages and one in ten (10%) are conversant in at least three.-Almost all respondents in Luxembourg (98%), Latvia (95%), the Netherlands (94%), Malta (93%), Slovenia and Lithuania (92% each) and Sweden (91%) say that they are able to speak at least one language in addition to their mother tongue.- Countries showing the most notable increases in the proportion of respondents saying that they are able to speak at least one foreign language well enough to hold a conversation, compared to data from the previous edition of the Eurobarometer survey, are Austria (+16 points to 78%), Finland (+6 points to 75%) and Ireland (+6 points to 40%).- In contrast the proportion able to speak at least one foreign language has decreased notably in Slovakia (-17 points to 80%), the Czech Republic (-12 points to 49%), Bulgaria (-11 points to 48%), Poland (-7 points to 50%) and Hungary (-7 points to 35%). In these countries there has been a downward shiftsince 2005 in the proportions able to speak foreign languages such as Russian and German.- Few countries show a noticeable increase in the proportion of respondents able to speak at least two foreign languages, with the most marked being in Italy (+6 points to 22%) and Ireland (+5 points to 18%).- However, nine Member States show a significant drop of more than 5 points: Belgium (-16 points to 50%), Hungary (-14 points to 13%), Bulgaria (-12 points to 19%), Poland (-10 points to 22%), Portugal (-10 points to 13%), Malta (-9 points to 59%), Luxembourg (-8 points to 84%), Denmark (-8 points to 58%) and Estonia (-6 points to 52%).- Countries where respondents are least likely to be able to speak any foreign language are Hungary (65%), Italy (62%), the UK and Portugal (61% in each) and Ireland (60%).-The five most widely spoken foreign languages remain English (38%), French (12%), German (11%), Spanish (7%) and Russian (5%).-At a national level English is the most widely spoken foreign language in 19 of the 25 Member States where it is not an official language (i.e. excluding the UK and Ireland).-The majority of Europeans who speak English, German, Spanish and Russian as a foreign language believe that they have better than basic skills. Ratings of skill level are broadly similar to those seen in the 2005 survey.- Just over two-fifths (44%) of Europeans say that they are able to understand at least one foreign language well enough to be able to follow the news on radio or television. English is the most widely understood, with a quarter (25%) of Europeans able to follow radio or television news in the language. French and German are mentioned by 7% of respondents each, followed by Spanish (5%), Russian (3%) and Italian (2%).- Europeans are just as likely to be able to read a newspaper or magazine article in a foreign language with just over two-fifths (44%) of Europeans saying they can. Again English is the most widespread foreign language, with a similar proportion of Europeans (25%) able to read a newspaper or magazine article in the language. French is mentioned by 7% and German by 6% of Europeans. …",1,0

"In a somewhat condescending review of A Dictionary of Canadianisms on Historical Principles some years ago, Mavor Moore complained about “a slighting of spoken practice and of distinctive Canadian syntax,” among his objections being the absence of an entry for eh? , for “both the English and the Americans can spot a Canadian from his ‘eh?’ at the end of a sentence: ‘It’s hot, eh?’” Admittedly, the interjection is not in the DC ; moreover, there are no slips for eh? in the citation files of the Lexicographical Centre for Canadian English. This situation certainly indicates that the readers for the DC did not consider it a Canadianism: either that or they were unaware that eh? might be relevant to the collection. The second of these possibilities may be set aside, for eh? is, in fact, entered in the Intermediate Dictionary and the Senior Dictionary , general dictionaries of English published in Canada for Canadians as part of the Dictionary of Canadian English series, to which the DC belongs. It should be added that eh? is also entered in every general dictionary of English, both British and American, on my shelves—a very considerable collection indeed, and one which includes the Oxford English Dictionary and Webster’s New International Dictionary (Third Edition).",1,0

"This paper examines defendants’ argumentative discourse in the 2008 Nigerian investigative public hearings on the Federal Capital Territory administration. The data, which consist of nine defendants’ presentations, are analyzed qualitatively, using a combination of the pragma-dialectical and extended pragma-dialectical theories of argumentation. The findings show that the hearing panel initially starts of as the institutional protagonist and defendants as the antagonists, and but later serve as the institutional antagonist and protagonists, respectively. The defendants tend to use analogy and causal argumentation schemes while employing subordinative and complementary coordinative argumentation structures. The defendants also employ different strategic maneuvers at different argumentative stages of the critical discussion. Due to the politico-forensic communicative domain and information-seeking genre of the investigative public hearing discourse, the concluding stage is suspended. Thus, the study shows the influence of communicative activity type on the argumentative activities in a critical discussion.",1,0

"Resumo: Neste artigo, pretendo destacar as contribuicoes da analise de generos sob a perspectiva sistemico-funcional (Halliday, 1985; Eggins & Slade, 1997; Martin & White, 2005), tomando como exemplo os resultados de um estudo preliminar do genero “critica”, veiculado em meio digital sitios de revistas de atualidades e em blogues de cinema. As diferencas encontradas na forma como o mesmo genero do discurso se materializa se justificam nao so em funcao de os textos serem disponibilizados em espacos de circula cao distintos, mas tambem porque as dinâmicas de interacao social entre os participantes tanto na extremidade produtora quanto na receptora dos textos se configuram de modo diverso. Os pressupostos da Teoria de Genero e Registro (Eggins & Martin, 1996), assim como as categorias analiticas derivadas da Linguistica Sistemico-Funcional, permitem que o pesquisador desenvolva analises refinadas e estabeleca correlacoes rele vantes e seguras entre os propositos, estagios e caracteristicas lexico-gramaticais dos generos e os contextos social e cultural onde ocorrem.

"This article investigates the syntactic and semantic relationship between the unselected object and the unergative verb in examples like Mary waltzed John around the room. Current consensus holds that this sentence involves resultative secondary predication, so that it is structurally equivalent to resultatives like Mary sang her throat hoarse. Yet it is well known that the waltz vs. sing verb phrase structures do not have the same argument or event structural interpretations. Notably the object with waltz seems to be an agent, while the object with sing is a patient or theme. Previous studies propose lexical rules of composition associated with waltz to specify the “special” interpretation of its object. In this article I show that the waltz object is not formally agentive, but has (what I call) an in motion interpretation. I further show that the waltz and sing verb phrases have different syntactic structures: the waltz verb phrase is transitive, and is not resultative. I argue that the contrast in interpretation between the object of waltz and sing (and the other differences in these clauses) follows from this structural difference, and that a lexical approach overgenerates. I conclude that the interpretation of the waltz object accords with regular rules of syntax-semantics correspondence.",1,0

"Australian deaf citizens are currently not permitted to perform jury duty, primarily due to their inability to hear the evidence and deliberate without the help of interpreters. Although interpreters are routinely employed to interpret for defendants or witnesses in court, current legal frameworks do not permit interpreters to enter the deliberation room as a ‘thirteenth person’, for fear that they may influence the jurors in their decision-making. Other objections to allowing deaf citizens to act as jurors include uncertainty about their ability to participate fully in the discussions, the impact the deaf juror’s and interpreter’s presence may have on the dynamics of the deliberations and on turn taking, and the logistics and cost involved. Yet, deaf citizens see it as their right to be able to perform this very important civic duty, and recent decisions at the international level indicate that excluding deaf citizens from jury duty should be considered unlawful discrimination. This paper will present results from the analysis of the jury deliberations with one deaf juror and two Auslan interpreters, and from a focus group discussion with the eleven hearing jurors and an interview with the deaf juror about their experience. The jury deliberation is one section of a large-scale study on the participation of deaf jurors in a criminal trial with Auslan interpreters, in New South Wales.",1,0

"The task confronting the linguist, or grammarian, has been posed in a number of ways. The traditional grammarian attempted to establish correlations between the physical facts of the language — the morphology — and the elements of a metaphysical, logical, scheme based on an analysis of the characteristics of human reason. The descriptive linguist attempts to describe language as a corpus, without recourse to a prioristic speculation or external theories. The generative grammarian has attempted to deal with natural language as though it were a particular instance of a mathematical language and can be generated in the manner of an arithmetic; and he increasingly tends to return to the development of metaphysical schemes that are independent of the physical characteristics of any particular language.",1,0

"In the field of human speech capturing systems, a fundamental role is played by the source localization algorithms. In this paper a Speaker Localization algorithm (SLOC) based on Deep Neural Networks (DNN) is evaluated and compared with state-of-the art approaches. The speaker position in the room under analysis is directly determined by the DNN, leading the proposed algorithm to be fully data-driven. Two different neural network architectures are investigated: the Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). GCC-PHAT (Generalized Cross Correlation-PHAse Transform) Patterns, computed from the audio signals captured by the microphone are used as input features for the DNN. In particular, a multi-room case study is dealt with, where the acoustic scene of each room is influenced by sounds emitted in the other rooms. The algorithm is tested by means of the home recorded DIRHA dataset, characterized by multiple wall and ceiling microphone signals for each room. In detail, the focus goes to speaker localization task in two distinct neighboring rooms. As term of comparison, two algorithms proposed in literature for the addressed applicative context are evaluated, the Crosspower Spectrum Phase Speaker Localization (CSP-SLOC) and the Steered Response Power using the Phase Transform speaker localization (SRP-SLOC). Besides providing an extensive analysis of the proposed method, the article shows how DNN-based algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches evaluated on the DIRHA dataset, providing an average localization error, expressed in terms of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), equal to 324 mm and 367 mm, respectively, for the Simulated and the Real subsets.",1,0

This article addresses the need to develop new pedagogic approaches which promote learner independence in contexts where learning takes place through the medium of more than one language. The challenges of responding to a rapidly changing educational landscape to ensure that our learners become pluriliterate global citizens are presented through three case studies each set in a different multilingual context. These classroom-based studies into effective learning focus on teachers and learners as co-researchers and involve reflexive processes which engage teachers and learners in the analysis of their own practices. The findings emphasise the need to support ‘reciprocity’ and ‘pedagogic attention’ through shared learner and teacher awareness of learning as well as to provide methods for instructing learners in metacognitive strategy use. The authors conclude that bilingual educational contexts provide potentially rich learning environments which – if they are to realise this potential – will demand new way...,1,0

"This article situates the Kurdish language within the diasporic context of the United States, and explores the roles that the language plays for the community. This is investigated through a mixed method encompassing literature and media reviews, interviews with community members and leaders, and a survey conducted among the Kurds in Southern California. The findings show that both first and second generation Kurds see their language not only as a symbol of their cultural identity and survival but a means of building and maintaining relations with each other, with other Kurds in the US, with relatives in the homeland, and also with their heritage. Nevertheless, members of the second generation think that language constitutes one of the most challenging cultural heritage elements to keep for many linguistic, socio-economic, cultural, and political reasons. The article concludes that there are no easy ways of maintaining minority languages like Kurdish much less transmitting them to future generations. The prospect for a promising future seems highly unlikely as long as heritage languages in the US are perceived as personal choices only, and the state does not assume responsibility for their maintenance let alone their transmission to future generations of newer immigrants.",1,0

"• Function-on-scalar regression models can be used to analyze and mass-compare speech spectra without reducing the complexity in the signal. • Using function-on-scalar regression, the shape of the speech spectrum can be modeled as the response variable. • Spectral dynamics over time can be analyzed and intuitively visualized using function-on-scalar regression. • The temporal dynamics of Danish stop releases and the influence of various contextual variables on their spectral properties are analyzed with function-on-scalar regression. • Danish /t/ is invariably affricated, but aspiration typically dominates part of the release. The acoustic characteristics of noise from fricatives and stop releases are difficult to analyze. The spectral characteristics of such noise are multi-dimensional, and popular methods for analyzing them typically rely on reducing this complex information to one or a few discrete numbers, such as spectral moments or coefficients of discrete cosine transformations. In this paper, I propose using function-on-scalar regression models as a method for analyzing and mass-comparing spectra with minimal reduction of the complexity in the signal. The method is further useful for analyzing how spectra change as a function of time. The usefulness of this method is demonstrated with a corpus analysis of Danish aspirated stop releases, using the DanPASS corpus. The analysis finds that /t/ releases are invariably affricated; /k/ releases are highly affected by coarticulatory context; and /p/ releases are almost always dominated by aspiration in the latter half of the release, but are affricated in the first half in certain contexts.",1,0

"Abstract Drawing on concepts such as convergence, divergence and maintenance associated with Communication Accommodation Theory, this article examines a group of Vietnamese ethnic minority students’ language choice in relation to their identity and social distance between them and their interlocutors. Our analysis suggests that the strategies of accommodation deployed by individuals can be related to common values/tendencies that are maintained by the groups and communities to which they belong, raising issues about structural influence on individual language choice and agency. We observe that enhancing the ethnolinguistic vitality of the home and the community in which senior members hold the key to language maintenance should be considered vital in reducing the new in-group distance created by young members. Moreover, multilingual policies which enable flexible attainment goals for all languages may provide a way forward for equity and reduction of social distance between different ethnic groups in society.",1,0
"In 1783, the King of Spain Carlos III enacted the last Royal Order for the control and assimilation of Gitanos or Calé. The law required that local authorities listed the Gitanos living in their counties. The resulting census is the most important document on the Spanish Romani written during the ancien régime. Unfortunately, its data has never been studied in depth. This paper analyzes the surnames of the 12,037 Gitano persons identified in the census and finds 567 different heritable family names. Interestingly, 10% of these surnames identified 75% of the Gitano population. The analysis shows that Gitanos already had the same names they have today, and that it is possible to trace personal genealogies linking Gitano people from this census with people alive now, some fourteen generations later. Gitano surnames were all Hispanic and many of them of aristocratic origin. Some were common to all Gitano groups, but most followed regional patterns and were differentiated by region and even by province. Baptism, mixed marriages, and imitation of neighbors were the most likely sources for the adoption of these surnames. Gitanos also used personal and family nicknames in their communities, but their official names were a crucial part of their personal and collective identity. Resistance, opposition, and contrasting cultural strategies should not ignore the hybridizing and creative adaptations of the Romani peoples.",1,0

"This article reports on an empirical study that investigated the relative predictive powers of metacognitive awareness of reading strategies, L2 lexical knowledge (depth and breadth combined), and syntactic knowledge for reading comprehension performance in English as a foreign language (EFL) context across two language proficiency levels in Iran. Participants comprised 177 Iranian EFL university students (82 males, 95 females; mean age = 19.17 years; SD = 1.829). The results produced from multiple regression analysis revealed that vocabulary, syntax, and metacognitive strategies can collectively predict 0.88 of changes in reading comprehension. More specifically, vocabulary, syntax, and metacognitive strategies each can predict 0.54 (t = 5.56, p = 0.001), 0.33 (t = 2.66, p = 0.008) and 0.15 (t = 1.96, p = 0.05) of variance in reading comprehension respectively. However, as for the moderation effect of language proficiency on the predictive power of the three variables for reading comprehension, it turned out that it moderated the predictive power of vocabulary knowledge for reading comprehension performance in a significant way. Results are discussed considering the relevant literature.",1,0

"Review essay on: B. M AC W HINNEY (ed.), The emergence of language . Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum, 1999. An old joke that has been circulating for the past decade or so goes as follows: a biologist, a physicist, and a cognitive scientist were sitting around discussing the great achievements of their fields. The biologist waxed eloquent about the insights of Darwin's theory of evolution; the physicist expounded on the implications of Einstein's theory of general relativity. Then the cognitive scientist spoke up: ‘Our great discovery is the thermos. You put a cold drink in, the drink stays cold. You fill it with hot soup, the soup stays hot. This is amazing, for how does the thermos know ?’ Obviously, this cognitive scientist has asked the wrong question about how the thermos maintains temperatures. In The emergence of language (henceforth, EL ), an edited collection of chapters authored by an interdisciplinary group of computer scientists, linguists, and cognitive and developmental psychologists, it is suggested that perhaps language acquisition researchers have been making the same mistake as the errant cognitive scientist. To be sure, language is an extremely complex phenomenon, yet it is also elegant. Recognition of these characteristics in all aspects of language (thanks in large part to Chomskyan approaches to linguistics) highlights a well-known apparent paradox: language is hopelessly complex but children acquire it with ease. Solutions to this paradox have typically inspired researchers to posit rules or other kinds of blueprints – knowledge (innate or acquired) that children have to guide their language acquisition. But are these rules truly necessary? Perhaps children do not KNOW how to acquire language any more than a thermos knows how to maintain temperature.",1,0

"1. La notion de convention connait dans la litterature de differentes sciences humaines un double traitement : d'une part elle est un element connu et ne demande aucune explication, d'autre part, elle sert d'outil qui permet l'explication des notions derivees plus complexes. En linguistique, c'est ce dernier traitement qui domine. En admettant qu'elle soit un element donne a priori , on la fait apparaitre en theorie linguistique dans l'interpretation de ses notions de base, comme code, langue, texte, fonction communicative de la langue *, proposition analytique 2. La theorie linguistique et la methodologie des etudes linguistiques attribuent un role particulier a la notion de convention. En comparaison avec le role que cette notion joue dans d'autres domaines scientifiques, ce role particulier demande a etre souligne pour deux raisons : toute langue, aussi bien naturelle qu'artificielle, est conventionnelle en tant que systeme de signes, et c'est uniquement au moyen de la langue (et en derniere instance grâce aux langues naturelles) qu'il est possible d'introduire la convention dans tous les domaines de la science, de la culture, et dans d'autres spheres de la vie humaine. Ainsi parait-il justifie d'avancer l'opinion que la notion de convention constitue la base sur laquelle se fondent des notions plus complexes, celles des conventions linguistiques tout comme celles des conventions extra-linguistiques, donc aussi des notions qui caracterisent differents types de conventions linguistiques, par exemple des conventions semantiques ou pragmatiques. Tout essai de distinction et d'interpretation de n'importe quel type de convention linguistique devrait donc commencer par l'explication de la notion de convention. La reflexion sur le probleme de la convention est anterieure a l'epoque socratique 3, elle accompagnait les debats au sujet de la nature des signes qui se sont deroules tout au long de l'histoire de la science. Il est donc evident qu'il serait impossible de completer a l'heure actuelle tous les ecrits consacres au probleme de convention. En tenant compte des limites imposees au texte presente ici, il est aussi indispensable de renoncer a une presentation generale de la litterature accessible sur le sujet de convention 4. Dans la reflexion qui devrait aboutir a l'explication de la notion de convention ellememe (du point de vue synchronique), on passe sous silence le fait qu'avec l'expres-",1,0

Cette répartition nous facilite l'identification des désignations qui – aujourd'hui - ne sont pas aussi univoques comme on pourrait le conclure rien qu'en se basant sur les répertoires lexicographiques de la latinité médiévale.

"AFTER an achievement such as the completion of A Dzctionary of 1E American Englash, it is inevitable that the field of American lexicography will appear to have contracted somewhat. Yet new material continues to accumulate; earlier examples and addenda come to light, and as the Editors of DAE indicate in their prefatory note to Volume IV in time a supplementary volume will become both desirable and necessary. The writer has occupied the scanty leisure of a British staff-officer during four years of war-time in collecting (with the continuous and kindly encouragement of one of the co-editors of DAE, Sir William Craigie) some two thousand notes on DAE, comprising earlier, later, and gap-filling examples, unrecorded Americanisms) earlier English examples of words considered to be of American origin, etc. It is hoped from these notes to indicate in this and other articles, with illustrative examples, some of the sources in which further material may be sought, and, in consequence, the classes of words likely to emerge in earlier examples. This may prove of interest as foreshadowing some of the paths along which DAE Supplement will be likely to move. For the colonial and revolutionary periods, American records have already been worked over with great care, as the Bibliography to DAE shows; British records still have a good deal to yield.

"THE STRIKING image of Janus, the Roman god, seizes our imagination, as he is depicted with two faces, each gazing in opposite directions. With one set of eyes cast toward a rising sun and the other toward a setting sun, he was the god of beginnings but one who could also ensure good endings. For nearly a century, parents, educators, and scientists have, like Janus, been of two minds about the bilingual child, a phenomenon that is so pervasive that we have come to call it “the bilingual paradox” in our laboratory (Petitto et al. 2001). [End Page 4] As if with eyes cast toward the positive light of a rising sun, we freely marvel at the seemingly effortless ways that young children can acquire two or more languages simultaneously if exposed to them in early life. At the same time, with eyes cast toward the darker light of a setting sun, we view early simultaneous bilingual exposure suspiciously, fearing that exposing a young child to two languages too early may cause language delay and, worse, language confusion. Indeed, the general perspective that young children are somehow harmed by early bilingual exposure is reflected both in educational settings and in comments made by the many parents raising bilingual children who visit our laboratory. For example, the fear that exposing a child to another language too early may interrupt “normal” language development is reflected in contemporary educational practice, whereby children in many countries around the world receive their first formal schooling in the other majority language well after the developmentally crucial toddler years. As support for this practice, many have invoked the dreaded notion of “language contamination” that ostensibly results from early exposure to another language (e.g., Crawford 1999). Following this general spirit, parents visiting our laboratory often opt to “hold back” one of the family’s two languages in their child’s early life. They believe that it may be better to establish one language firmly before exposing their child to the family’s other language so as to avoid confusing the child. They also worry that very early bilingual language exposure may put their child in danger of never being as competent in either of the two languages as monolingual children are in one.",1,0

"This study investigated the use of 'mama' or similar sounds (collectively referred to as 'MAMA') by 75 infants less than six months of age. Parents were directed to listen for 'MAMA' sounds and to note the sounds made, the age of onset, whether the sounds appeared to be directed to any person or persons and whether they appeared to have a purpose. 'MAMA' began at a mode of two months, range two weeks to five months, was usually part of a cry, and was always interpreted as a 'wanting' sound. Most parents thought that the infant wanted some form of attention, but a minority thought it indicated hunger. Responses to a Structured Response Protocol indicated that some infants uttering 'MAMA' were satisfied if a favourite caretaker approached and paid attention to them while the remainder were satisfied if they were both paid attention to and picked up. The 'MAMA' cry appears to promote attention-giving behaviour by parents and other caretakers.",1,0
"This paper focuses on the effect of the gender of participants on the discourse patterns of university seminars, and compares the interaction patterns in two undergraduate seminars with those in two post-graduate seminars at Rhodes University. In the undergraduate seminars, two different groups of students at first year level in different disciplines were videotaped. The major difference was in terms of composition: in one seminar, there were equal numbers of male and female students, while in the other, female students dominated numerically (75%). In addition, five of the six formed a close-knit group of friends, which proved to be an important factor in the analysis. At the postgraduate level, the student participants were identical and met in the same venue and at the same time on two successive days to discuss the same topic (affirmative action in the workplace). The important difference between the two classes was the fact that the first seminar was led by a female tutor and the second seminar by a male tutor, both under 40 years of age and white, both members of staff in the department, and both known to the students. The discourse patterns in these two sets of seminars were analysed in order to investigate the ways in which the gender of tutors and students influenced the floor-winning and floor-holding conventions of participants.

"Kripke’s puzzle has put pressure on the intuitive idea that one can believe that Superman can fly without believing that Clark Kent can fly. If this idea is wrong then many theories of belief and belief ascription are built from faulty data. I argue that part of the proper analysis of Kripke’s puzzle refutes the closure principles that show up in many important arguments in epistemology, e.g. if S is rational and knows that P and that P entails Q, then if she considers these two beliefs and Q, she is in a position to know that Q.",1,0

"Liangdao Man and Austronesian origins Laurent Sagart (bio) The discovery of Liangdao Man, a skeleton C-14 dated to c. 6000 BCE, under a shell mound in Liang Island north of the Taiwan strait, and the sequencing by Ko et al. (2014) of its mitochondrial DNA, have brought new light on Austronesian origins. Liangdao man’s mtDNA belongs to a very early form of haplogroup E, which is exclusively Austronesian and well represented in Taiwan in two forms: E1 and E2. In JCL 43.1A (2015), Paul Li discusses the “implications for the pre-Austronesian homeland” of the discovery of Liangdao man. Li’s assumptions are these: on the ground of morphological arguments in Reid (1994), he accepts the view that Austronesian and Austroasiatic are sister branches of ‘Austric’. A critique of these morphological arguments can be found in Kaufman (2013). Li also accepts the arguments of Norman and Mei (1976) for an Austroasiatic presence on the southeast China coast. See however Sagart (2008) for a critique of their lexical arguments. Based on these assumptions Li supposes that unitary Austric was spoken on the southeast China coast and that Liangdao man spoke Austric (‘an Austric’, p. 228). Li correctly reports the finding by Ko et al. that Liangdao Man’s mtDNA is the ancestral form of all Formosan E1 haplotypes. He is silent, however, on the origin of Haplogroup E: according to Ko et al., haplogroup E developed out of haplogroup M9 on the southeast China coast near Fuzhou c. 8,136–10,933 years ago. As to haplogroup M9 itself, it gave rise to another daughter on the mainland: M9a, which is found among Chinese, Tibetan and other Sino-Tibetan-speaking groups. This directly support of the Sino-Tibetan-Austronesian theory (Sagart 2005), as Ko et al. note: [End Page 239] At around the time when haplogroup E developed from M9 in the population that later carried it into Taiwan, the surrounding regions gave rise to M9a* lineages that are now carried by Sinitic speakers. Thus, the Han, Liangdao Man, and Formosan haplogroup M9a/E lineages can be traced to an ancestral M9 mtDNA lineage (Figure 3). Additionally, the Tibetans have a high frequency of M9a lineages that is shown to have coalesced during the Neolithic and there is a hypothesized linguistic link between Sino-Tibetan and Austronesian languages. Human genetics, then, do not confirm the Austric claim: rather, Austronesian E Haplogroup’s most direct sister is the Sino-Tibetan M9a haplogroup, which points to Sino-Tibetan as Austronesian’s next of kin. A pre-Austronesian homeland located in north China will also explain the northern Chinese look of early Austronesian agriculture: two of the main Austronesian cereals—foxtail millet, broomcorn millet—originate in northern China, and are unknown archaeologically in the Yangtze Valley and south of it. A third cereal: rice, was under monoculture in the Yangtze Valley, but was also exploited in the north together with foxtail and broomcorn at very early dates, for instance at Yuezhuang in northwestern Shandong c. 6000 BCE or Tanghu in Henan c. 5700 BCE.

"Aperiodicity in sustained phonation can result from temporal, amplitude and waveshape perturbations, turbulent noise, nonlinear phenomena and non-stationarity of the vocal tract. General measures of the periodicity of the voice signal are of interest in, for example, quantifying voice quality and in the assessment of pathological voice. High and low quefrency cepstral techniques are employed to supply an index of the degree of voice signal periodicity. In the high quefrency region, the first rahmonic is used to provide an indication of the periodicity of the signal. A new measure, SRA (sum of rahmonic amplitudes) - utilising all rahmonics in the cepstrum, is tested against synthesis data (six levels of random jitter, cyclic jitter, shimmer and random noise). In addition, an existing popular technique using the first rahmonic (cepstral peak prominence, CPP) is assessed with synthesis data for the first time. Both measures decrease with increasing aperiodicity levels of the glottal source, decreasing more noticeably for noise and random jitter than for shimmer and cyclic jitter. CPP is shown to be relatively f0-independent; however, the index appears to be less sensitive when compared against SRA.",1,0

"The maps and place-names of early Massachusetts offer an unusual perspective of implicit design that newcomers to a land may impose on it. The organization of terrain by those like English settlers of 1600s derives in good part from beliefs on how to make it serve purposes of a particular society and culture. That land may still appear, say, in a natural state, or that other, far different cultures such as Algonquians may have long held it, clearly influences but does not necessarily govern a new pattern of settlement. Surely John Winthrop's views on English rights to lands of Massachusetts exemplify one approach toward establishing a claim on supposedly open territory. For as he believed, English settlers had warrant enough, as a matter of' 'civill right, to appropriate land, to regard it as their share of the Lordes garden, which they would not let lye waste without any improvement. 1 This image of Massachusetts as a land awaiting development supported belief of English that it was a vacuum domicilium. And idea of lands not yet settled invites imagination and will to impart form, to create civil order, to draw up maps, and to bestow placenames. The enterprise of entering a land as English of seventeenth and eighteenth centuries had done suggests for study of maps and placenames a condition analogous to work of a reader bent upon editing and annotating a text. Here is land of Massachusetts, a text unfolded for first time to eager congregations, ready to explore it and to indicate through local plans and place-names just what significance they find in it. Insofar as they examine and discover what it is they hoped land would reveal or yield, likelihood is that they will mark it off and name it.

"The People of the Eye: Deaf Ethnicity and Ancestry, Harlan Lane, Richard C. Pillard, Ulf Hedburg (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011, 269 pp., hardcover, $49.95, ISBN 978-0-19-975929-3) THIS VOLUME HAS a double aim. The authors argue for the importance of understanding Deaf people, in this case American Sign Language users, as a distinct ethnic group (Part I). This then frames an in depth history of the Deaf families of New England (Parts II-IV). Starting with the voyage of the Mayflower in 1620, and continuing until about 1640, more than 20,000 colonists, most of them English Puritans, made their way to New England's harsh shores. This small founding population and the practice of intermarriage within extended families including between first cousins led to significant Deaf lineages in New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and Maine. The first known Deaf person of Henniker, New Hampshire, was Nahum Brown, a farmer born in the late 1700s. His Deaf son,Thomas Brown, entered the American Asylum, the school founded by Thomas Gallaudet and Laurent Clerc, at eighteen and was one of the first pupils to graduate. There Thomas Brown met Mary Smith from Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts. They married and returned to Henniker where they were at the center of an active Deaf community. In 1887, the American Asylum listed forty-four students past and present from the Henniker area. This Deaf enclave became a powerful force in the Deaf institutions of the era. Thomas helped found the New England Gallaudet Association of Deaf-Mutes (NEGA), copublished a newspaper, was director of the Deaf-Mute Library Association, and helped found the New England Industrial School for Deaf Mutes. His Deaf son and nephews followed in his footsteps. The Deaf community of Martha's Vineyard was quite different from that of Henniker. The Vineyard had high rates of intermarriage between just a few families with multiple ties to Deaf ancestors from England's Kentish Weald. This led to high rates of deafness and to a population where both Deaf and hearing people knew sign language. DeafVineyarders lived lives similar to those of their hearing neighbors, sharing professions such as farmer and fisherman, interacting with many of them easily in sign language, and marrying hearing people at a far higher rate than their Deaf counterparts in Henniker. In the late eighteenth century, setders from Martha's Vineyard, including Deaf families, moved to Maine, drawn by inexpensive land and a wealth of natural resources. Parts III and IV describe the important Deaf families of the northern cluster, including the Smith- Parkhurst and Samuel Allen clans, and the Davises, Lovejoys, Jellisons, Jacks, and Berrys, and the southern cluster including the Rogers-Holmes, Badger-Boardwin-Brown-Glidden, and Curtis-Rowe clans. The most interesting parts of these chapters are the glimpses into the everyday lives of Deaf individuals that reveal the close ties between Deaf families and fellow Deaf- Wo rid members. In 1849, Samuel Rowe wrote to his brother-in-law Ebenezer Curtis, saw some former deaf-mutes, viz Homer Smithu, and some old ones I did not remember well. . . .You will laugh at me for I am everyday happy to be in the company with sister PersisD, Lucy M. Reedu [wife of Benjamin RoweD] who works with PersisD, and Lucvd's brother AdinD is in town and works as a printer (p. 155, information in [ ] brackets and d for Deaf from Lane et al.) In 1850, Rebekah Allen met numerous Deaf cousins from Massachusetts and Connecticut at the American Asylum alumni reunion. Sometime around the turn of the twentieth century, Francis Berry had an adulterous affair with Mrs. Isaac Jellison, nee Lydia Lovejoy; their unsanctioned relationship thus bringing together three of large Deaf clans. These small tastes of lives left me wishing for much more. Deaf families are a key part of the authors evidence for Deaf ethnicity which surpasses family in its scope: it evokes a rich history of one's kind and a historic fate across generations (i). …",1,0
"Idioms differ from other forms of figurative language because of their semantic dimensions of familiarity (frequency of encounter), ambiguity (possibility to have a literal interpretation), decomposability (possibility of the idiom's words to assist in its figurative interpretation) and transparency (possibility to deduce the original metaphorical motivation of an idiomatic phrase from its literal analysis). A variety of approaches have been used to investigate the way idioms are processed in the brain. Studying clinical populations is one of them. Supporting evidence has been drawn from studies examining subjects suffering from aphasia, typically caused by lesions to a complex language network involving the main language areas in the Left Hemisphere (LH) of the brain. Patients with aphasia sometimes show selective impairment in idiom comprehension, implying that there are types of idioms, less impaired in comprehension, which do not depend solely on the LH of the brain. However, recent literature does not seem to agree in terms of when such preference exists and if the types of idioms and tasks employed play a crucial role. This study investigates idiom comprehension in aphasia and seeks to explore (1) the effect of idiomatic stimuli in terms of their semantic dimensions on the patients' language performance (2) a potential effect of the tasks employed on the patients' language performance. A systematic review was done following the PRISMA approach. Starting from an initial find of n = 457, after applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 15 articles were retained for further analysis. Relevant information that was extracted included differences and similarities across studies, especially focusing on patient characteristics (age, type of aphasia, severity of aphasia, post onset period, handedness, type of lesion (i.e., single focal vs. multiple), lesion location, etiology and test used for diagnosis), stimuli (types of stimuli, stimuli's assessment, consistent use of terminology) and task employed (type of task, task options, modality of presentation and response, and types of measurements) and language comprehension patterns. Results indicated that studies in idiom comprehension in aphasia are characterized by great heterogeneity regarding the experimental task and the type of idiomatic stimuli employed. Heterogeneity in these key aspects, results in unclear interpretation of idiom comprehension patterns in aphasia across studies. In addition, the nature of idiomatic stimuli and more specifically their semantic dimensions were insufficiently described, and their descriptions were sometimes accompanied by terminological inconsistencies. Moreover, patient profiles were occasionally incomplete and more importantly, language comprehension patterns were reported after considering patients with aphasia as one homogenous group irrespective of their aphasic syndrome. Last, this review proposes recommendations for future research, focusing on patient profiles, experimental tasks and stimuli as well as the interpretation of language comprehension patterns.",1,0

"SOMEWHERE IN THE DIM PAST of the early nineteenth century (as I suspect but cannot prove), our grandparents or their parents, in pursuit of the pleasures of elegance, clothed their speech, as also their corporosities, in the fashion of the times. Proper speech being an appurtenance of good manners, they composed, and taught their children, certain formulas of polite expression fitting to such social situations as they were liable to encounter.' They knew well that informality is notoriously untrustworthy, that the spur of the moment can urge a speaker to disastrous infelicities. Better far to be prepared, to have an appropriate formula fall trippingly off the tongue. Imagine, for example, the dinner guest who, having partaken of everything in sight, is being plied by his hostess to stuff himself further. Smiling assuredly, he replies, No, thank you. I have had a genteel sufficiency-any more would be superfluity. The occasion is met, the temptation resisted, and the formula has attested the propriety of the guest's upbringing. A preamble to what tale? The tale began when, as editor of the Dictionary of American Regional English, I was asked by an elderly lady in West Virginia to explain the word cironcified (as she spelled it). Neither it, nor anything like it, is in the dictionaries. I began inquiring around me, got a few replies, then printed a query about it in a widely read publication.2 Suddenly the mail began to pour in. To date I have received forty-six letters and several postcards giving the writers' versions, no two exactly alike, of the formula of polite refusal as used by their family or acquaintance, usually by an elderly person, but remembered appreciatively by some younger ones. Most of these formulas have at their center some version of my elderly lady's etymologically mysterious word. The formulas typically fall into two parts (like the elegant one quoted above), one part refusing more food, the other explaining the refusal. A common pattern is My sufficiency is fully surancified; any more would be obnoxious to my fastidious taste. Obviously, the original, serious formula has become inflated; it is on the way to jocular, even satiric, exaggeration. Our attitude toward verbal elegance has changed: one does not say that sort of thing nowadays unless in humorous mockery. Surancified, at the center of the new formula, is clearly intended to be impressive and a bit mysterious. Our evidence suggests that the original formula was elaborated until it became too hard to learn and produced",1,0

"This study analyses sequences where people with dementia are positioned as third parties in stories about their own lives. Previous research emphasises how people with dementia are frequently excluded from social encounters, and how others tend to speak for or about them in their co-presence. Drawing on conversation analytic methods when analysing 15 video recorded interviews with Swedish couples living with dementia, we argue that telling stories in which a spouse with dementia is positioned as a third party in his or her co-presence does not have to be an activity of exclusion. Rather, among couples, third-party positioning is a multifaceted activity where couples employ different practices to organise participation frameworks and manage both inclusion and exclusion in talk-in-interaction. Furthermore, we show how participants display joint speakership and counteract actions of exclusion by making use of various communicative resources such as gaze, touch and bodily orientation.",1,0

"The meager Arabic literature on modality was one of the pivotal impediments that challenged non-Arab translators when interpreting Qur’an verses. That being so, this study attempts to highlight some epistemic and deontic modality bloopers in some translated verses in Surah Al-Kahf (18:1-21). This modality investigation was carried out within the theoretical framework of the values and realizations of English and Arabic modality systems set by Halliday and Matthiessen (2004) and Anghelescu (1999). The results showed that, first, translators should not use English epistemic possibility modals with low values when rendering Arabic verbs in the subjunctive mood. Second, some Arabic conjunctions such as “أو” ‘or’ convey a degree of possibility that requires an English epistemic possibility adjunct modal to be there in the target text. Third, Arabic verbs with emphatic affixes are better translated with an English modal expressing high degree of inclination. Keywords: Epistemic Possibility, Deontic Modals, Modality, Proposition, Subjunctive and Jussive Moods.",1,0

"Linguistic prominence in speech is known to correlate with the acoustic measures of energy, F0, and duration. In contrast, the role of spectral tilt in the realization of prominence has remained more inconsistent between previous empirical investigations. This may be partially due to the lack of a standard method for quantifying spectral tilt or due to difficulties in estimating the acoustical source of spectral tilt, the glottal flow, from continuous speech. These issues have rendered interpretations and comparisons between studies difficult. In addition, (i) little is known about the robustness of tilt estimators for prominence detection in the case when speech is not clean but corrupted, as in real life, by environmental noise or telephone transmission (i.e. degradation caused by bandpass filtering and quantization noise). Moreover, (ii) little attention has been paid to multidimensional representations of source spectrum that can potentially incorporate more information about the phonation style than purely scalar measures. In this work, we study spectral tilt in signaling prominence in spoken Dutch and French under different levels of additive noise, and for telephone-band coded speech, and compare several one-dimensional tilt measures that have been previously encountered in the literature as well as multidimensional tilt measures. We also compare spectral tilt measures with other standard acoustic correlates for prominence, namely, energy, F0, and duration. Our results provide further empirical support for the finding that tilt is a systematic correlate of prominence in Dutch, that the role is smaller in French, and that energy, F0, and duration appear still to be the most robust features for discriminating prominent and non-prominent words. In addition, our results show that there are notable differences between different tilt measures at different levels of noise, and that multidimensional representations for tilt improve class separability from the scalar measures.",1,0

"The present article aims to reconsider in detail the original formulation of Grassmann’s law (GL), proposed by Grassmann (1863), since the main handbooks of Indo-European linguistics often repeat an extremely concise and sometimes incomplete formulation of the phenomenon without going into the details of Grassmann’s original reasoning, from which the definition of the phonetic “law” took its shape. In fact, we intend to highlight, on the one hand, the route whereby the scholar arrived at the decisive formulation of the principle which took its name from him, on the other the research ideas already present in the article of 1863 and only partially taken into account by subsequent studies. In addition to offering an overview, as complete as possible, of the resonance and influence of GL among linguists (both within a general and a historical linguistic perspective), over the years, the intent is to show the fruitfulness of ideas that still today could be used for new studies on the topic and to offer a possible, new interpretation of this phonetic change.",1,0

"Dans tous les domaines curriculaires nord-américains en éducation, les termes enquête ou investigation sont maintenant plus répandus que jamais. Ce virage radical des programmes scolaires traditionnels vers des approches pédagogiques fondées sur l’investigation soulève des questions quant aux promesses et aux défis potentiels que présente l’apprentissage de l’anglais langue seconde en classe, de la maternelle à la 12 e année. Les auteures de cette étude qualitative exploratoire se penchent sur la question suivante : quelles sont les possibilités et les difficultés associées aux approches fondées sur l’investigation dans l’apprentissage de la langue, la littératie et la compréhension du contenu chez les apprenants de l’anglais qu’exigent aujourd’hui les programmes scolaires de la maternelle à la 12 e année ? Elles procèdent à une analyse thématique récursive des données tirées d’entrevues semi-structurées avec huit experts en enseignement des langues et littératies et relèvent trois thèmes en ce qui a trait aux possibilités qu’offre l’approche basée sur l’investigation pour améliorer la compréhension du contenu chez les apprenants de l’anglais ; accorder une place prépondérante aux langues et littératies des apprenants ; promouvoir le respect de la diversité ; et utiliser les outils numériques pour soutenir leur apprentissage de la langue et du contenu et amplifier leur voix. Trois éléments émergent en ce qui a trait aux défis à relever : la résistance des éducateurs au changement, la sous-estimation des ressources nécessaires et la communication avec les parents ou tuteurs des apprenants de l’anglais. Les auteures traitent des répercussions de ces résultats sur les politiques et les pratiques relativement aux stratégies pédagogiques basées sur l’investigation, à la multimodalité et au multilinguisme pour favoriser la réussite des apprenants de l’anglais.",1,0

"F A PERSON DISREGARD such exotics as Sandemanians, Ranting Quakers, or Morris-dancing Papists, he will recall that colonial American writings labeled various Christians as 'Papists,' 'Churchmen,' or 'Dissenters.' loday, however, unless the denomination be specified, Christians are known as either Catholics or Protestants. What happened to religious appellatives in the meantime? When did it happen? From the middle of the sixteenth century to the end of the seventeenth, the English vocabulary of religious designations had been fluid, but by about 1700 it had stabilized itself. Western Christians were divided (as they had been since the late 1500s) into two classes, Papists and Protestants, with the latter subdivided (since about I640) into Churchmen and Dissenters. Catholic was an uncommon term, sometimes applying to Anglicans and sometimes to Romanists. In the English language at the time, those people who belonged to the established Eng!ish Church were, understandably, Churchmen, and those who dissented from it were Dissenters. But, although adherents of the pope did in fact dissent from the national English Church, they had had the name of Papist for over a century prior to the entry (about i640) of Dissenter into the language and thus were never put under the latter heading.2 The terminology of the British Isles naturally prevailed in the British American colonies, and just as naturally it began breaking down after the achievement of the political independence of these colonies. Within a generation after the American Revolution, the American religious vocabulary had altered considerably, and by about the year 1870 the modem classifications of Protestant and Catholic had been firmly established. The nineteenth century is the watershed of American religious terminology. The critical fact is the disintegration and virtual disappearance of the terms Papist and Dissenter, which caused a correspondingly radical change in the meaning of Protestant. With some brief necessary background, let us inspect these phenomena more closely.",1,0
"In the recently published third volume of his Indogermanische Grammatik Professor H. Hirt, in his strikingly original and suggestive way, has unfblded a panorama of the history of the formation of IE nouns which differs so radically from the conception of the majority of scholars both in many details and in his general point of view, that it will be of the utmost importance to examine the credibility of his theories and the reliability of his methods. This is true all the more because his presentation, as elsewhere, through its clarity, through the interest which it arouses, and through the confidence with which it is presented, is apt to fascinate the minds of those who have not yet formed an opinion of their own, but are seeking orientation in the problems of IE linguistics for the first time. The outstanding peculiarity of Hirt's opinion is this, that while he believes in adaptation as far as inflectional endings are concerned, and insists on the identity of these with the word-forming suffixes, yet the latter themselves are explained altogether in the manner of Bopp and his followers. It is true that he admits that new suffixes arise by misdividing words, so that the suffix is increased at the expense of the primitive word, and that he devotes a whole chapter to this process, but to him this simply means taking a formative part of the word and adding to a suffix which already was there (226), as in the example of Gr. (epvKbs by misdivision as pev1-LKbs giving rise to the suffix -LKOS. He ignores the possibility that parts of roots and unanalyzed words may become suffixes through word contamination and subsequent associations of old and new forms, e.g. that IE *9him-osl Skt. him-ds 'cold' brought its",1,0

"L'etude qui suit fait partie d un ensemble de recherches sur les incidences psychologiques des situations linguistiques complexes qui se poursuivent au sein du Groupe d'etude du langage plus particulierement au sein de TER du C.N.R.S. n° 163 de la section de psychologie a l'Universite Louis Pasteur de Strasbourg. Elle rend compte d'un aspect particulier de ces travaux concernant la dynamique de la situation linguistique en Alsace .v Aucune situation linguistique n'est ni reellement homogene, ni reellement stable. Un etat de langue connait des ensembles de realisations diverses dont certains sont formellement et fonctionnellement identifiables, decrits par exemple sous les termes de « variete de langue » ou de « registre », leur nomenclature restant difficile, voire impossible a fixer. Ces ensembles exercent des influences variees les uns sur les autres et la stabilite d'un etat de langue est ainsi relative. Mais elle l'est encore parce qu'aucun groupe linguistique ne reste durablement a l'abri de contacts avec d'autres groupes, ce qui donne lieu a des interferences de langue et a des emprunts d'importance diverse. La complexite de l'ensemble de ces processus rend leur description difficile. De fait l'elucidation d'un systeme linguistique ne va pas sans un certain nombre d'abstractions qui concernent tout particulierement tous les processus dont les incidences, a la frange du systeme, restent, en stricte synchronie, limitees. Une des pretentions de la sociolinguistique est cependant de recuperer l'ensemble de ces processus, non pas pour les rapporter au systeme de la langue mais par leur integration a une rationalite qui serait d'ordre social (MarceLLESI, 1980 : LEGRAND, 1980). Language in Society , titre de la principale revue de sociolinguistique americaine, est revelateur a cet egard. Une serie de travaux, reunis dans un prochain numero de V International Journal of the Sociology of Language sur la realite des langues regionales en France en milieu rural, illustre de maniere repetee ce qui semble etre la principale caracteristique sociolinguistique de ces situations : une correlation positive entre milieu rural et emploi de la langue regionale, correlation d'autant plus positive que sont mieux conserves mode de vie et mode d'exploitation traditionnels de l'environnement. Une telle correlation se retrouve tant en Bretagne qu'en Alsace, en pays catalan qu'en pays languedocien ou gascon. Que signifie-t-elle ? Ou plus precisement peut -on conclure de son omnipresence que les processus qui la sous-tendent sont les memes et que donc, dans tous les cas, c'est une disparition des formes locales ou regionales qu'il faut envisager ?

"This study details a comparative, corpus-based discourse analysis of corpora containing educational documents distributed to parents and guardians of K-12 children in public schools in the United States (US). The exploratory local corpus (n=152,934) contains parent-directed educational documents collected from four public schools in a city located in the south-eastern US with an unusually high percentage of foreign-born residents. The comparison corpus (n=147,796) contains parent-directed documents collected from a sampling of K-12 schools across the US. Following Baker et al. (2008) , keyness and collocations were utilised as central theoretical notions and tools of analysis, in addition to a lexical sophistication comparison, in order to investigate text simplification across corpora. Results show that while the first corpus used labels for students that were superficially inclusive, English language learners themselves were discursively represented as outsiders facing barriers to inclusion that native-English speaking monolingual students do not face. Furthermore, the first corpus revealed an emphasis on identifying and categorising language learners so as to provide them with immediate services, while the non-geographically specific corpus focussed more on the long-term development of learners and on preparation for post-secondary education. We discuss the implications for language policy in public education and for policies related to K-12 school-to-home correspondence.",1,0

"Ce recueil est consacré au passif, ou à ce que l’on appelle communément « voix passive ». Il réunit des travaux portant sur diverses langues vernaculaires, avec parfois une dimension contrastive. L’intérêt de cette entreprise vient du fait que la construction étudiée ici est surtout considérée dans ses manifestations à l’oral, à partir de situations authentiques de communication, ce qui va à l’encontre de ce qui est constaté dans la tradition grammaticale. En effet, le passif est, depuis toujours, enseigné et décrit sous l’angle de situations typiques, formatées et quasi figées, issues essentiellement de la langue écrite ou reposant sur des phrases forgées. Ainsi, dès que l’on parle du passif, on ne peut pas s’empêcher de penser au fameux exemple La souris est mangée par le chat. Le passif est le plus souvent vu comme le résultat d’un retournement de l’ordre plus neutre de ce que représenterait la contrepartie active. Il rapporterait un certain scenario, présenté sous l’angle de celui qui « subit l’action ». Ce retournement grammatical de l’ordre des actants est identifié comme une opération de thématisation (ou de « promotion de l’objet »), qui est généralement interprétée comme un indice d’importance ou de saillance du sujet passif (patient/objet) aux dépens de l’agent. Toutefois, en considérant de près des données à partir de conversations réelles renfermant un passif, on s’aperçoit, d’une part, que les exemples, du type La souris est mangée par le chat, sont rares ou complètement absents, d’autre part, que ces hypothèses ne se vérifient pas forcément. Ainsi, contrairement à ce qui est répété habituellement, l’agent exprimé explicitement s’avère plus important que le patient, au moins pour deux raisons : (1) il parait résister à toute tentative de suppression dans les exemples oraux ; (2) le patient apparait surtout comme un simple pronom faible, renvoyant à un référent déjà connu et dont l’intérêt ne dépasse pas le rappel et l’activation de la référence. De fait, il ne semble porter aucune marque de saillance, dont le passif serait à l’origine. C’est dans cet esprit que le présent numéro se propose de revenir sur différentes problématiques liées au passif dans les langues considérées dans le but de compléter les descriptions existantes et repenser celles qui ne paraissent pas représentatives de ce tour grammatical.

Selon cette hypothese, les objets qu’ils introduisent dans le discours voient leur existence garantie par leur localisation dans un ensemble, la localisation spatiale ne jouant, meme dans le cas de [b], qu’un role de second plan. Si l’ensemble de depart contient des objets de meme nature que celui dont l’existence est assertee (les cygnes en general pour [a], les cygnes de l’univers du discours pour [c]), alors l’interpretation est partitive. S’il contient des objets de nature quelconque, reunis par la relation spatiale qu’ils entretiennent avec un meme objet (le lac en [b]), alors on a une interpretation faible.",1,0

"Seventeen years ago, Redmond reviewed five standardized behavioral rating scales and identified several aspects of their design that made them prone to mischaracterize language impairments as socioemotional behavioral disorders. The purpose of this report is to provide an update and extension of the original audit. We consulted test manuals to evaluate: (1) representation of children with language impairments in their standardization samples; (2) presence of language, or academic items within their inventories; (3) accommodations for administering the measure to children with language impairments; and (4) procedures for identifying inordinately punitive ratings. Overlapping language and academic symptoms continued to be a problem across current behavioral rating scales. Improvements since Redmond occurred in the representation of children with language impairments in standardization samples and in procedures for identifying inordinately punitive ratings. We discuss implications for clinical assessment, research programs, and instrument development.",1,0

"Special Issue: Twenty-Fifth Anniversary of the Deaf President Now Movement Brian H. Greenwald (bio) I was a student at Clarke School for the Deaf in Northampton, Massachusetts, in March of 1988, when Deaf President Now (DPN) broke out. My classmates and I were not aware that the signing deaf community had a rich history of activism and self-empowerment, for this was not taught to us in those days. We were familiar with the history of Clarke School and the hearing luminaries, such as Gardiner Greene Hubbard, Alexander Graham Bell, and Grace Coolidge, who played significant roles in the school’s past, but deaf people’s long-simmering discontent with 124 years of control by hearing presidents at Gallaudet University was a complete surprise to us. One morning, as I was tidying up my dormitory room before heading to class, a fellow student burst into my room, waving his hands frantically, motioning me to follow him. I was reluctant at first but decided to follow him down the hall to the “recreation room,” which was where we relaxed by watching television or playing various games. There sat probably a dozen boys in front of the television, which was broadcasting events from Gallaudet. I was completely mesmerized—never before had I seen so many deaf people signing in one place. We had a “houseparent,” who essentially served as a supervisor for my floor. She would remind us of the importance of speaking and refraining from signing. As we watched the events of DPN unfold on television during the morning and evening news, we became emboldened and started signing to each other. She tried to interfere, but we stood firm and continued signing. This was our time and our place, and the houseparent knew this. We read the newspapers—I believe [End Page 5] they were the local Northampton paper and the Boston Globe—but we grasped only that DPN was about a deaf president. Clarke School had two deaf employees, Kevin Nolan Sr. and Winchell Moore, who might have explained more. I do not recall, however, having a conversation with either one of them about DPN. We did not understand much else at that time—the rich history, the oppressive and paternalistic attitudes imposed by hearing people on deaf people, and, most importantly, that deaf people were seizing agency that belonged to them. March 2013 marked the twenty-fifth anniversary of those events, the Deaf President Now movement, that changed Gallaudet University.1 Over the course of eight days, the protest, which was led by the student body and the alumni, was staunchly supported by the school’s faculty and staff and was overwhelmingly endorsed by local and national media. It led to the resignation of the newly appointed hearing president, Elisabeth Zinser, and the selection of her successor, I. King Jordan. Deaf and a Gallaudet graduate, Jordan became the eighth president of Gallaudet University, shattering forever the institution’s control by hearing presidents. Sufficient time has now elapsed, and enough distance has been gained from those exciting times so that we can take advantage of comprehensive perspectives on the legacy of DPN. Past milestone anniversaries of DPN typically were celebratory—and rightfully so. We in the Deaf community have had much to celebrate. During the spring 2013 semester, however, we took a more scholarly tack. A total of twelve different panels and lectures utilized a two-pronged approach: the first goal was to illuminate the roles and contributions of DPN participants that had not previously been explored. The second goal was to begin assessing the significance of DPN over the past quarter century. The DPN protest was remarkable not only for its short duration but also for its overflowing support from the campus community (though support was by no means unanimous) and those outside campus. Politicians, activists, and especially the media consistently recognized and affirmed DPN as a civil rights movement. There are few examples in our history where deaf people transcended cultural and linguistic differences and galvanized in support for a common cause. Past examples include campaigns to overturn prohibiting driving [End Page 6] rights and to promote passage of the Television Decoder Circuitry Act of 1991. These...",1,0
"The purpose of this Special Issue is to expand our understanding of conceptual metaphors in six of Ghana’s Indigenous languages: Asante-Twi, Gonja, Likpakpaln, Mfantse, Nzema, and Safaliba. The authors bring new knowledge to the international community from these understudied languages, which may become inaccessible in the not too distant future, particularly those from oral sources, given Ghana’s political embrace of neoliberal global flows of people, goods, and information which expands the reaches of language shift. Nevertheless, the specific metaphor data from the languages in this Special Issue represent the first preliminary examples of documentation and hence are of foundational significance, as the data generate new understandings.",1,0

"Using interactional sociolinguistics, I analyze two versions of a narrative chronicling the humorous antics of a prankster called Zimmerman who, along with the narrator, was a seminary student in the Midwestern United States in the 1950s. To explore the interactional function of telling stories about pranks, I compare two versions: one which is more performative (Schiffrin, 2006), the other which feels more like a summary, calling attention to differences in narrative evaluation accomplished through use of such linguistic features as reference, deixis, and contextualization cues (i.e. laughter). I argue that both versions accomplish moral positioning for the narrator, and work to construct and negotiate his identity as someone who values cleverness, finding humor in the playful defiance of authority. However, by contrasting a telling in which this evaluation is accomplished internally (the more performative version) to one in which evaluation is largely external, I hope to highlight how evaluative devices contribute to meaning-making through narrative performance in the relatively understudied genre of prankster tales.",1,0

"El presente estudio tuvo por objetivo determinar el efecto de los conectores en la eficiencia del procesamiento de relaciones de coherencia causal en lectores con diversos grados de conocimiento previo. Se implementó un experimento con estudiantes universitarios de una misma área disciplinar utilizando el paradigma de lectura autocontrolada con ventana cumulativa y combinando mediciones en línea (tiempos de lectura) y fuera de línea (precisión en una tarea de verificación). Para controlar su grado de conocimiento previo, los participantes fueron agrupados según el paradigma Experto-Novato dependiendo del año de estudios en el que se encontraban. Nuestros datos muestran, a nivel general, que, pese a que los conectores causales incrementan los tiempos de lectura, facilitan una comprensión más profunda. En cuanto a la comparación entre grupos, si bien nuestros datos no muestran diferencias entre ellos, revelan el mismo patrón general. Estos datos sugieren que, al menos en entornos especializados, los conectores desencadenan una lectura intencionada, lo que en el caso de lectores con alto grado de conocimiento disciplinar, como los de nuestro estudio, involucra que los recursos cognitivos son utilizados para asegurar una comprensión profunda. Asimismo, nuestros datos sugieren que una lectura más veloz, no necesariamente asegura la construcción de una representación mental coherente.",1,0

"Bone Black represents bell hooks' lifestory of survival amidst a harsh racist and sexist environment in the South of the United States in the 1950s. Her childhood is clearly dominated by a feeling of estrangement and loneliness together with the pain of being the different one, the problematic child, the rebel. Out of the vignettes that compose her autobiography, those related to her maternal grandparents enclose the author's most cherished memories, steeped in the magic of storytelling, quilting and the life-giving communion with the earth and the natural elements. It is in the nurturing wisdom of the old and in the embracing welcome of books that hooks will eventually find what she was most yearning for, a way to belong",1,0

"This study investigates the use of ethnonyms in the toponymies of Hassahiesa and Rufa’a areas in Gezira State, Sudan. Using the principles of Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) and Discourse Historical Approach (DHA), the study analyses place names as arenas of power struggle and explores the additional functions they play. It studies the distribution of ethnonyms in the names of 1161 villages and the impact of the historical, socio-political, and economic factors on their choice. The study shows that there are two types of ethnonyms used in the two areas and that their distribution is more widespread in the toponymies of Rufa’a than in that of Hassahiesa. It further shows that the unequal distribution of ethnonyms is the result of herders’ migrations to the Butana plain and the introduction of the agricultural scheme and light industries in Gezira. The study demonstrates that the inhabitants of Rufa’a used ethnonyms as a passive resistance strategy to challenge state power. On the other hand, the decreased number of the feature in Hassahiesa is an indication of its farmers’ population integration in the colonial development projects and their tendency to form multi-ethnic and cooperative communities. It indicates that ethnonyms are utilized as identity constructive and perpetuating strategies and as boundary demarcation markers.

"Abstract With the increase in global movement, both temporary (travel and transsettlement) and permanent (e/immigration), traditional conceptions of the linguistic processes rooted largely in the long-term translocation(s) or migrations are revisited through the study of family language policy. The present study of family language policy serves as a telling case (Mitchell, 1984) of (1) translanguaging (Williams, 1994) as a practical theory of language (Li, 2018), describing how the transnational individual experienced the construction of two intergenerational translanguaging spaces (Li, 2011): the family and the community and (2) how the phenomenon of monolingual ideologies infiltrates the translanguaging space of the family to exert its influences toward the standard, in this case the standard Russian dialect. Importance of increased mobility characteristic of contemporary times and the central role of temporality in linguistic processes and their disruptions are discussed in this article.",1,0

"El presente trabajo se incluye en el marco del Programa Minimalista (Chomsky 1995 y trabajos posteriores) y toma como dominio empírico las construcciones reflexivas del español. Se hace foco en un dato no estudiado hasta el momento como lo es la imposibilidad de reflexivizar el objeto directo en construcciones ditransitivas ante la presencia de un clítico dativo (cf. *Juan se le entregó a la policía vs. Juan se entregó a la policía). Suponiendo que la presencia del clítico dativo indica que el argumento meta es jerárquicamente superior al tema, proponemos que esto se explica como un problema de localidad en la asignación temática. Este análisis tiene consecuencias teóricas importantes respecto de la teoría temática en general. Básicamente, argumentamos que aporta evidencia a favor de las teorías que sostienen mecanismos de asignación temática a distancia bajo condiciones de localidad y actividad determinadas. Adicionalmente, se analizan posibles contraejemplos (cf. Juan se le entregó a María) y se demuestra que su distribución los asemeja a las estructuras cuasi-reflejas del español (e.g., Juan se levantó), lo que fuerza a un análisis sintáctico diferente de este tipo de ejemplos. Se esboza entonces una derivación que permitiría dar cuenta de varias de las propiedades morfosintácticas e interpretativas de estas oraciones en particular, y de las construcciones cuasi-reflejas, en general.",1,0

Il apparaît en effet que, dans certaines séries de morphèmes fermées du français, le phonosymbolisme est très largement présent.

"Second-language learners of American Sign Language (ASL) often struggle in the acquisition of more complex ASL aspects, such as role shift, constructed action, and eye gaze to represent characters and their actions with narratives. These learners also often overestimate their ASL skill level. This study investigated errors in second modality, second language (M2L2) university learners' ASL narrative retellings through rating comparisons (i.e., agreements and disagreements) between learners themselves and their instructor. Learners engaged in repeated viewings of ASL models of two Signing Naturally stories, Timber and Gum, paired with instructor analysis, modeling, and feedback on learners' productions within a sociocultural framework. Learners' self-evaluations were compared to instructor evaluations using an itemized list of narrative episode details and options for how they were produced to identify where these evaluations were in agreement or not. Overall agreement was high (i.e., M = 92%), however, agreement across specific ASL aspects, including role shift, constructed action, and accurate sign production, varied to a greater extent (i.e., 89–94%). Two types of disagreements occurred: those in which learners rated a detail as absent while the instructor rated it as present, and those in which learners rated a detail as present while the instructor rated it as absent. Omissions occurred infrequently, in which both the learner and instructor agreed that a detail was absent. The specific instructional framework used in this study and implications for university-level ASL instruction are discussed in this article.",1,0

"In the following pages, we provide extracts from the Reports of the Committee of Inquiry into the Teaching of English Language (‘The Kingman Report’) of March 1988, relating to the teaching of English in England and Wales, and published by Her Majesty's Stationary Office, London. The committee of 19 scholars, writers, and educators was chaired by Sir John Kingman, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Bristol. The four professors of English on the committee were Gillian Brown (Applied Linguistics, Essex), Brian Cox (English Literature, Manchester), Peter Levi (Poetry, Oxford), and Henry Widdowson (Education; English for Speakers of Other Languages, London). The 100-page report (ISBN 0 11 270650 9)has six chapters and eight appendices. The chapters set the scene (1), discuss the importance of knowledge about the language (2), present a model for teaching English (3), discuss the use of the model (4), cover attainment and assessment (5), look at the education and training of teachers (6), and provide a summary of recommendations. The appendices cover terms of reference (1), membership of the committee (2), a note of reservation by Professor Widdowson regarding the need for a more searching initial discussion of why English should be a school subject at all (3), sources of evidence submitted to the committee (4), visits made by committee members (5), a glossary of specialist terms used in the report (6), a bibliography (7), and a pull-out summary of the model. Our extracts relate to the 5-part model and the attainment targets suggested. We reproduce both in full, as being of particular international interest and in Angles of Vision provide a range of excerpts from the British press when the report appeared.",1,0

"EMA and EPG offer complementary information about tongue articulation. In this paper, comparisons are made of lingual constriction location estimates for high vowel continua, based on EMA and EPG data simultaneously recorded for one speaker. These data pertain to an experiment which correlated articulatory estimates of constriction location with formant measurements for comparison with Fant’s (1970) model-based nomograms. A circle model was used to estimate the constriction location from two dorsally located EMA sensors. The center of the constriction was deemed to be where the circle was closest to the roof of the mouth. Those estimates are compared to three types of EPG-based estimates of lingual constriction. The first is the row of narrowest constriction in a scaled vertical view of the EPG palate. The second is a “center of gravity” estimate. The third is an approximate side view of the tongue contour, drawn on the basis of the innermost activated electrode on each EPG row. Results suggest a broad agreement as well as consistent discrepancies between EMA and each EPG estimate. Likely reasons for discrepancies are discussed, and it is suggested that some of these may offer new insights into three-dimensional aspects of articulation that might be exploited in research.",1,0

抽象 早期上海話口語文獻顯示，雖然各類位移事件詞化結構皆有S型框架特徵，但無生自移事件S型框架傾向最強，其次是致移事件，而有生自移事件的V型框架傾向最明顯。位移事件內部詞化結構類型的差異反映了三者所受演變機制或者影響程度之別：雖然雙音節化和語義要素分離成為漢語位移事件向S型框架轉變的重要機制，但早期上海話中致移事件的詞化類型主要受制於連動結構語法化為動趨式的制約，有生自移事件卻借雙音節化使V型框架特徵更為穩定，無生自移事件因語義表達需要更青睞S型框架結構。研究表明，演變機制對詞化類型的制約作用並非均衡的，也非線性的，而是具有複雜性。,1,0

"Abstract As texts about sound symbolism are currently missing, this article wants to inspire new interest in this topic. To begin with, earlier studies are surveyed which dealt directly with sound symbolism in various empiric ways. Next, fields of research are depicted which presently touch upon sound symbolism, such as language evolution, synesthesia, ideophones, names in literature and brand names. It will be argued that research in sound symbolism proper could help to support and even put into perspective some quite hasty results in neighbouring disciplines.",1,0

"Guadalupe Valdes and Richard Figueroa carefully and clearly craft an argument for why bilingualism and testing constitute a special case of bias that continues to have serious consequences for today's school-age minority population in the United States. This argument could not be more timely, given the drive in the United States for standards and a rising wave of state-mandated standardized testing programs for all students, including bilinguals. Perhaps a summary of this book should be on the desk of every educational leader and policymaker charged with the mandate of administering standardized tests to bilingual students and comparing their scores with those of monolingual groups for the purpose of special education and vocational placements.",1,0

"Abstract This article closely examines how both linguistic and non-linguistic objects and inscriptions emplaced in the built environment transform the traditional residential-business street into a space of consumption for a new generation of Chinese tourists. The data consists of observation notes, photographs, and interviews obtained from an ethnographic fieldwork in Kathmandu, Nepal. The article makes three major arguments. First, the semiotic shift and the social practices that inhabit the space represent a key feature of a late capitalist society with a focus on the commodification of languages, cultures, and identities. Second, the practices index the global power of the Chinese language in challenging English and marginalizing other tourist languages. And third, these shifts urge us to understand the relation between semiotic and material resources in redefining traditionally West-oriented global tourism economies. The study overall provides new insights into how language and material goods can create a completely different kind of Chinatown, entailing a new interaction order between business owners and tourists, which use intertextuality, translanguaging, and multimodality, among others, as resources. These findings are starkly different from studies that have examined traditional Chinatowns in diasporic contexts.",1,0

"The existence of infixation in Austroasiatic has always been treated as a given: one of such antiquity that it has been proposed as a possible index of genetic affiliation with Austronesian. Nor does the comparative method allow the reconstruction of a typologically more plausible set of prefixes from which the attested infixes could have been derived via metathesis. Yet a plausible mechanism for the infixation process can be suggested on the basis of internal reconstruction, given the following facts about Khmer: 1. A canonical iambic word structure; 2. An ongoing process of initial syllable erosion whose most consistent effect is the simplification and reduction of the rhyme of the anacrusic syllable. Both facts, although currently attested, are also of great antiquity in Austroasiatic. In Viet-Muong, the process of erosion, unchecked, led to a lexicon of monosyllabic roots. In (Mon-)Khmer, erosion created a perceived gap in the structure of the word. Infixation plugs that gap.",1,0

"Abstract This paper explores the isomorphic co-expression of nominal predication subdomains across ten Indo-Iranian languages. Unlike many previous studies, this paper takes into account combinations of structural coding means, and does not limit its scope to the copula. Further this paper does not limit its attention to “primary” strategies and also takes into account “secondary” or “rare” attested strategies. Then, this paper presents a method based on bipartite graphs to visualize and compare patterns by which two subdomains of nominal predication are co-expressed by isomorphic combinations of coding means. The results show that every pair of subdomains is co-expressed at least somewhere across the family. In five of the ten languages studied here, predicative possession is expressed by the coding means usually used for equation or proper inclusion, but never as the main strategy to express predicative possession. This suggests that unlike what scholars have so far assumed, such situations may be crosslinguistically common but intra-linguistically rare. Another surprising result is the rare isomorphic co-expression of predicative possession and predicate location (i. e. with completely identical morphosyntax), but the much more common co-expression of predicative possession and existence. Altogether, this paper highlights the importance of taking into account intra-linguistic variation in morphosyntactic comparison.",1,0

"Tendenzen der bildung von hypokoristischen formen der litauischen zusammengesetzten namen in der umgangs­spracheZusammenfassungIn diesem Aufsatz wird die Tendenzen der Bildung von hypokoristischen Formen der litauischen zusammengesetzten Namen in der Umgangssprache erforscht. Es sind vier Arten der hypokoristi­schen Formen zu unterscheiden: 1. die Namen, die aus dem ersten Stamm der zusammengesetzten Namen gebildet sind (z.B., Rimas < Rim-vydas, Skiras < Skir-mantas), 2. die Namen, die aus dem zweiten Stamm der zusammengesetzten Namen gebildet sind (z.B., Girdas < Al-girdas, Mantas < Do­-mantas), 3. die Namen, die aus dem ersten Stamm und dem Teil des zweiten Stammes der zusammen­gesetzten Namen gebildet sind (z.B., Algima < Alg-i-mantas, Virmis < Vir-mantas), 4. die Namen, die aus dem Teil der zusammengesetzten Namen gebildet sind und mit dem konsonantischen Suffixe er­weitert sind (z.B., Rimka < Ri-mantas, Tautka < Taut-vydas). Durch die statistiche Analyse der Daten wird festgestellt, daß in der Umgangssprache die hypokoristischen Namen, die aus dem ersten Stamm und dem Teil des zweiten Stammes der zusammengesetzten Namen gebildet sind, sehr produktiv sind: diese Namen bilden 73% aller hypokoristischen Formen. Bei der Untersuchung der hypokoristischen Formen klärte sich die strukturellen Verbindungen der Namen auf: die Struktur der hypokoristischen Formen von der Struktur der zusammengesetzten Namen und der Struktur des Suffixes abhängig ist. Man kann behaupten, daß intralinguistische Umstände für die Entstehung der hypokoristischen For­men sehr wichtig sind.",1,0

"Abstract Traditionally strict language separation policies in dual language bilingual education (DLBE) programs reflect parallel monolingualism and have been criticized as failing to recognize the sociolinguistic realities of bilingual students (García, Ofelia &amp; Angel M. Y. Lin. 2017. Translanguaging in bilingual education. In Ofelia García, Angel M. Y. Lin &amp; Stephen May (eds.), Bilingual and multilingual education , 117–130. Cham: Springer International Publishing). To recognize the dynamic nature of bilingualism and leverage bilingual learners’ full semiotic and linguistic repertoire as a resource, this study looks at how to strategically and purposefully develop flexible and multilingual educational spaces in a third grade Chinese Language Arts (CLA) class in a Mandarin-English DLBE program in the New England area, U.S. Drawing upon Sánchez, María Teresa (Maite), Ofelia García &amp; Cristian Solorza. 2018. Reframing language allocation policy in dual language bilingual education.

Cognition and Instruction 34(3). 173–193. https://doi.org/10.1080/07370008.2016.1181879 ), this collaborative inquiry demonstrates that translanguaging pedagogies could promote student engagement, contribute to their academic learning, and build home-school connections. It aims to provide authentic, sustainable knowledge for both researchers and practitioners to better serve bilingual learners in DLBE programs.",1,0
"The thesis uses a substantial corpus which spans a period of 100 years to
examine English legal discourse and the appropriateness of law as a specialized
language and as a linguistic medium. The analysis has three main
foci: (1) the analysis of the message content by means of refining the techniques
of semioticians and linguists, (2) the study of English history and its
influence on the language of English law and (3) the technical and specialized
contributions of jurists and judges (from the civil, the
administrative or the criminal register). Two layers within the discourse
are then distinguished in this study: rigidity and fluidity which show a permanency
and renewal.

A major concentration in the study is vocabulary relations. Legal words
have a peculiar tenacity – an ability to achieve stability within changing
social and economic conditions (Geny 1922) although the illusion is of
conservatism, rigidity and uniformity – because the social structure penetrates
into the architecture of legal language. That is why every past and
present society has its own knowledge of words, and many have created
new words or modified the meanings of existing words in order to reflect
their particular standards and expectations (Hobbes 1971), as shown
below for the word ‘night’:

 Under the Night Poaching Act 1828, s.12, it is stated that “the night
shall be considered and is hereby declared to commence at the expiration
of the first hour of sunset, and to conclude at the beginning of
the last hour before sunrise”.
 Under the Customs and Excise Management Act 1979, s.1 “night means
the period between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m.”.
 Under the Highways Act 1980, s.329(1) it “means the time between half
an hour after sunset and half an hour before sunrise”.

Moreover, this web-like semantic organization – described by Eco (1976)
as a multi-levelled maze – demonstrates complexity which arises from the
specific activities of professionals (either judges, jurists or MPs) who
impose their definitions and contributions upon historical, economic and
social events showing, for example, a conflict with the contemporary
grammar:

 In any Act, unless the contrary intention appears,
 (a) words importing the masculine gender include the feminine;
 (b) words importing the feminine gender include the masculine;
 (c) words in the singular include the plural and words in the plural
include the singular.
 (Interpretation Act 1978, s.6)

Therefore, it is highly important to show how lexical items, created or
modified by jurists, judges and MPs, slot into the common language and
how the factual references turn the semantic content into a technical language:
history, aspects of generalization (‘dis-individual’ in Delmas-Marty
1986: 25), judicial actors and formal systems have an influence over the
meanings of legal terms.

 One more obvious and important point emerges; that text-organizing
vocabulary (Coltier and Turco 1988) functions on the surface of some specific
genre discourses (Kevelson 1988, 1991). Three genre discourses are
examined: prescriptive, descriptive and explanatory registers. Their
analysis demonstrates that the influence of judicial speech is, paradoxically,
a source of both rigidity and fuzziness.

Besides, this language of the law has developed in a social context,
meaning that it will gradually change according to the social and historical
circumstances of the country (Carbonnier 1978). Thus another genre
factor to be reckoned with is related to the difference between academic
science and popular science, i.e. professionals of the field and lay people.
Indeed words have their own legal tradition (history) or silent backgrounds
(specialized meanings) which can only be understood by a
professional of the field. Given this criterion, lay individuals are in a state
of perplexity because the language of the law has developed without
taking into account everybody’s personal background (‘a language of fool’
in Gridel 1994). And so, there is a clear division between non-practising
people and practitioners as shown below with the word complainant:

 one who makes a complaint to the justices (Jowitt Dictionary)
In subsection (1) of this section “complainant” means a woman upon
whom, in a charge for a rape offence to which the trial in question
relates, it is alleged that rape was committed, attempted or proposed
 (Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1976, s.3)

Moreover, English law still interlocks with other European Union member
countries’ legal architectures and will affect their future evolution. So, the
last issue highlighted in this thesis – ‘LSP translation’ – considers that
words do not develop along the same path in all languages. Indeed, as languages
are influenced by the culture and the history they are part of (the
fuzzy part), LSP translators must find acceptable words in the other language
in order to produce an acceptable translation. As a result they must
avoid mismatches between the source-language (Legal English) and the
target language (Legal French). That is the reason why the primary task for
translation consists in exploring the common territory where legal English
terms and legal French words can work together and share the knowledge
that belong to both (the rigid part). The main aim of LSP translation will
then be to develop the ability of translators to perfectly comprehend both
English and French legal reasoning, the nature of the subject, and the
subject treated, so that translators may express themselves as justly as if
they wrote the original.

"Gesture in political oratory and debate is renowned for its nonreferential indexical functions, for the way it purportedly can indicate qualities of speaker and materialize acts of persuasion — functions famously addressed in Quintilian’s classic writings but understudied today. I revisit this problematic through a case study of precision-grip (especially thumb to tip of forefinger) in Barack Obama’s debate performances (2004–2008). Cospeech gesture can index valorized attributes of speaker — not directly but through orders of semiotic motivation. In terms of first-order indexicality, precision-grip highlights discourse in respect of information structure, indicating focus. In debate, precision grip has undergone a degree of conventionalization and has reemerged as a second-order pragmatic resource for performatively “making a ‘sharp’, effective point.” Repetitions and parallelisms of precision grip in debate can, in turn, exhibit speaker-attributes, such as being argumentatively ‘sharp’, and from there may even partake in candidate branding.",1,0

"The British conquest of Canada in 1760 marked the birth of an Englishspeaking minority in the colony. Although its political, economic, and social influence was great, numbers remained small until British immigration increased substantially in the first half of the nineteenth century. By 1850, English speakers made up nearly a quarter of the total population and were a majority in Montreal. Most could trace their origins to the British Isles, but over the next century people from other European countries were integrated into the community. English language schools played an important role in reinforcing the community until the Charter of the French language (1977) forced immigrants to attend French schools. The creation of separate institutions in education, health, and social services allowed English speakers to live apart from the majority and consider that they were part of an English-Canadian majority. The community relied on the mediation of their elites to defend their concerns. The old order collapsed, however, in the face of more vociferous national aspirations on the part of the majority. Since the election of a Parti Québécois government in 1976, uncertainty has increased and numbers have dwindled, putting into question the future viability of the community.",1,0

"In this article, we argue that the TV series event with the highest audience in recent Catalan history, La catedral del mar /Cathedral of the Sea (Jordi Frades, 2018), is an example of commercial cinematic populism. Cathedral of the Sea is built on formal elements of the classic Hollywood style (for example, continuous editing, linear narrative, lack of moral ambiguity), and a series of substantive dichotomies (people/ elite, the popular hero/ the villain, the good/ the bad) and myths (the savior, the unity of the people). In analyzing their significance, we distinguish three hermeneutic layers, the populist, the general-mythical, and the Catalan historical context, which, in combination, constitute the cinematic narrative. Therein the central hero of Cathedral of the Sea, Arnau Estanyol, personifies the myth of the commoner who, by accumulating a whole range of virtues and social roles, synecdochically stands for the triumphant emergence of the modern Catalan people. This narrative is, we maintain, traversed by a tension between the populist call for emancipation, incarnated by Arnau, and the phantasmal self-gratification based on the depiction of a world devoid of complexity.",1,0

"Current work on automatic coreference resolution has focused on the OntoNotes benchmark dataset, due to both its size and consistency. However many aspects of the OntoNotes annotation scheme are not well understood by NLP practitioners, including the treatment of generic NPs, noun modifiers, indefinite anaphora, predication and more. These often lead to counterintuitive claims, results and system behaviors. This opinion piece aims to highlight some of the problems with the OntoNotes rendition of coreference, and to propose a way forward relying on three principles: 1. a focus on semantics, not morphosyntax; 2. cross-linguistic generalizability; and 3. a separation of identity and scope, which can resolve old problems involving temporal and modal domain consistency.",1,0
"The field of linguistic landscape (LL) is concerned with monolingual and bi/-multilingual patterns and practices enacted on ‘public road signs, advertising billboards, street names, place names, commercial shop signs, and public signs on government buildings’ (Landry &amp; Bourhis, 1997: 25).

"Dans cet article je voudrais aborder un probleme historiographique et métho­ dologique: le passage de la comparaisonde langues à la gramrilaire comparée. Ce passage reflète une certaine continuité - au niveau des materiaux et de l'analyse comparative d'un certain nombre de langues, mais il témoigne d'une discontinui­ té radicale que les historiens de la lhiguistique interprètent souvent comme tin pro­ cessus de sophistication allant vers la création d'un paradigme ''scientifique""C'est aussi le sentiment de ceux qui font partie des générations ""panidigmatiques"". Ainsi, Antoine Meillet n'hésite pas à dater l'emergence de la granimaire comparée: ""La grammaire comparée a été créée au début du XIXe siècle par les savants allemands et danois”. On aurait mauvaise grâce a soupçonner le maître français de myopie historique: Meillet est conscient de la longue préhistoire du comparatisme, mais il prend soin de la distinguer de la grammaire comparée. La pierre de touche iciest la méthode, et il n'est done pas étonnant que le premier chapitre de 1'/ntroductioil de Meillet porte sur la méthode de la grammaire comparée.

"Western Malayo-Polynesian (WMP) languages exhibit inner diversity with regard to voice systems. While some lack verbal morphology encoding voice alternations, others demonstrate so-called symmetrical voice alternations. This paper discusses the internal typological grouping within the latter classification of languages, which are further categorized as being either Indonesian-type and Philippine-type. There are, however, certain languages that do not exhibit all the criteria of either category, but do display symmetrical voice alternations. These languages can be viewed as having ‘transitional’ features. With a focus on two languages from Indonesia, this paper aims to provide a new semantic perspective for describing one of these transitional features by examining voice alternations and categorizing the languages as having either a derivational voice system or an inflectional voice system .",1,0

"Some Empirical Results About The Nature Of Concepts George Lakoﬂ&#39; University of California at Berkeley It is diﬂicult to write anything short about concepts once one has written a 600—page book on the subject (Lakoli, 1987). What I will try to do is try to set down as brieﬂy and succinctly as possible some of the basics of what has been learned from empirical studies in the various cog- nitive sciences. But before getting on to a substantive discussion, it should be noted that there are important negative results: —Concepts do not ‘mirror nature’; they are not mere internal representa- tions of external reality. —-Concepts are, for the most part, not deﬁned by necessary and sufficient conditions. — Natural kind concepts constitute an interesting special case: Biological natural kind concepts do not refer to sets of biological entities in the",1,0

"People often become confused, mistaking one thing for another, or taking two things to be the same. How should we assign semantic values to confused statements? Recently, philosophers have taken a pessimistic view of confusion, arguing that understanding confused belief demands significant departure from our normal interpretive practice. I argue for optimism. Our semantic treatment of confusion can be a lot like our semantic treatment of empty names. Surprisingly, perhaps, the resulting semantics lets us keep in place more of our everyday interpretive practices in the face of confused belief.",1,0

"The past two decades have witnessed a virtual renascence of interest in the apparently aberrant phenomenon of the Germanic Verschairfung.l This revival has been largely due to the discovery of the Indo-Hittite laryngeals and their application to Germanic phonology by Henry Lee Smith Jr. Most scholars2 agree that the laryngeals are somehow involved, but are not in agreement on the details of the involvement. Only a few, like Coetsem,3 make neogrammarian appeals to Brugmann. A. Holtzmann was the first to notice the phenomenon of 'doubling' (or Verschairfung) of IE medial y and w, in many cases, to Gmc. -jjand -ww-; this doubling is still often called 'Holtzmann's Law'.4 The strengthened articulation of Gmc. -jjand -wwgave -ggjand -ggvin Norse, -ddjand -ggwin Gothic. The writings -ggjand -ddjundoubtedly represent a prevelar stop with a palatal offglide in Old Norse and a palatal stop with a palatal offglide in Gothic. In West Germanic the first elements of the strengthened -jjand -wwformed diphthongs with the preceding short vowels. Examples: ON tveggia 'of two': Go. twaddje, OHG zweiio, Skt. dvdyos; ON tryggva 'make trusty': Go. triggwa 'alliance', OHG treuwa 'faith' < IE *drewa-. On the other hand there are forms that show no Verscharfung, as ON eir (< *ajaz) : Go. aiz, OHG er, Skt. dyas 'bronze'; ON Jrzr : Go. *]reis, OHG drA, Skt. trdyas '3'. Occasionally both developments appear, as in ON Frigg: Go. frijon 'love'; ON hQggva 'cut': Go. hawi 'hay'. The Verscharfung has been attributed to accent. Holtzmann, Kluge, and Prokosch held that it was caused by a preceding accent;6 Mikkola Trautmann,",1,0

"Neurogenetic disorders are a heterogeneous group of known genetic disorders.[1] [2] These genetic mutations, additions, and/or deletions affect brain development, resulting in a cascading effect on other domains of development (i.e., cognition, language, social and emotional skills, and behavior). Each neurogenetic disorder is associated with a syndrome-specific pattern of behavior referred to as a behavioral phenotype.[3] [4] A behavioral phenotype is defined as “the heightened probability or likelihood that people with a given syndrome will exhibit certain behavioral or developmental sequelae relative to those without the syndrome.”[3] (p.523) Although this means that certain behaviors and developmental characteristics are more common to many people with the disorder, not all individuals will display these features. Furthermore, not all of these features are completely unique to the disorder.[3] [5] [6] [7] One common feature across individuals with neurogenetic disorders is the presence of intellectual disability, with more than 1,300 genes associated with intellectual disability.[2] [8] [9] Importantly, neurogenetic disorders can be diagnosed early in development (i.e., pre-, peri-, or postnatally), providing early opportunities for intervention. Because many children with neurogenetic disorders also have language and communication disorders, they begin to receive speech-language pathology services starting at an early age. Furthermore, these difficulties with language and communication can be lifelong, requiring intervention and support for successful participation and independence.",1,0

"Abstract: At Joyce Public School (JPS) in the Greater Toronto Area, we are engaged in ongoing collaborative action research to develop pedagogical approaches to emergent literacies that engage multilingual, multicultural, and multimodal perspectives in complex interplay. Our research is grounded in the challenges children experience in acquiring literacy across home, school, community, and societal contexts in a culturally and linguistically diverse urban setting, given limited curricular opportunities for involving multiple languages in literacy education. Our research involves collaboratively designed classroom-based narrative projects that productively entwine multilingualism, English language discovery, and digital technologies in elementary literacy instruction. This article provides first-person perspectives on and an analytical discussion of the emerging pedagogies of three primary-grade teachers involved in our collaborative multiliteracies research who successfully engage multilingualism in English language and literacy education.",1,0

"Bien que le public visé joue un rôle important dans tous les modèles de rédaction, peu de chercheurs se sont intéressés à la façon dont les rédacteurs en langue seconde (L2) conceptualisent leur public et s’adressent à lui au cours du processus de rédaction. L’auteur entend combler cette lacune en analysant quand et comment les apprenants de la L2 envisagent leur public lorsqu’ils écrivent en L2 et en s’interrogeant sur l’incidence du public visé sur leur processus d’écriture et leur texte. Chacun des 16 apprenants de la L2, à deux niveaux de compétences linguistiques en anglais (faible et élevé), effectue quatre tâches d’écriture nécessitant la rédaction de messages courriel destinés à des publics différents quant au degré de familiarité avec le rédacteur et à la position sociale par rapport au rédacteur. Chaque participant regarde ensuite un enregistrement vidéo de son exercice immédiatement après avoir terminé la rédaction de chaque message courriel et récapitule, en rappels stimulés, ses pensées au moment de la rédaction du message. Les messages courriel sont analysés selon une méthode multidimensionnelle, alors que les rappels stimulés sont codés en fonction des processus de rédaction (conceptualisation de la tâche, prise en considération du public visé et révision du message, par exemple). Les observations tirées de cet exercice indiquent que la tendance des participants à planifier, contrôler et réviser leurs textes diffère selon leur degré de familiarité avec les publics auxquels le message écrit est destiné. Les caractéristiques linguistiques des messages courriel que les participants écrivent varient également selon les publics visés et les groupes.

Se han analizado 382 redacciones de alumnos de 4º curso de Educación Primaria (9 años), 2º curso de Educación Secundaria Obligatoria (13 años) y 2º curso de Bachillerato (17 años). Los resultados muestran que la generación posinternet obtiene índices más altos en la mayoría de parámetros analizados.

"The aim of this article is twofold. First, we claim that δ-features (discourse features), as well as ϕ-features, can be inherited from C to T (Richards 2007, Chomsky 2008), as shown by wh-agreement on T in Ojibwe (Algonquian). Our analysis supports Miyagawa's (2010) hypothesis that discourse and agreement features are two sides of the same coin, which can be distributed differently crosslinguistically. Second, we propose that although ϕ and δ typically bundle together on a single C head, this is not the case in all languages and in fact will vary parametrically. Ojibwe clause typing is partitioned between agreement/ϕ-features on independent order (i.e., plain matrix) C and discourse/δ-features on conjunct order (e.g., embedded) C. This parameter, that certain features may or may not bundle on C, captures a significant cluster of properties in Ojibwe: Initial Change, lack of person prefixes in the conjunct order in contrast with the independent, as well as the availability of long-distance agreement. Our proposal supports the idea that much crosslinguistic variation reduces to the distinct feature structures making up functional heads, such as v, D, and C, rather than to primitives.",1,0

"The increasingly intense level of competition of the National Spelling Bee in recent years suggests that this “brain sport” has become a complex site for the politics of language standardization, media, and childhood competition. In this article I delve into this nexus to explore its heart: sound. Drawing on ethnographic research conducted at spelling bees and with spellers, families, officials, and media broadcasters, I examine how spellers experience the word as a melange of sounds, the embodied processes that inform their orthographic choices, and how this sensory process made viewable for media audiences who may know little about orthography. Employing what Steve Feld (2015) has called “acoustemology,” I analyze competitive spelling through the lens of “firstness,” a concept the philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce (1955) identified as a mode of being replete with unmediated feelings and qualities. Two-minute spelling bee turns serve as ethnographic examples of language materiality that reveal the complex routines that spellers undertake in each spelling bee round. This onstage sensorium also provides a basis upon which media broadcasters create metasemiotic frameworks through which to observe and understand the complexity this sensory activity.

"Although it is beyond question that lexical borrowing from Quechua into Spanish occurred during the colonial period, determining when structural interference of Quechua on Peruvian Spanish can be said to have begun is a more difficult matter. It is here proposed that the development of contact features is dependent on a series of sociolinguistic conditions that trigger the development of a contact variety. The development of contact features, then, is understood not as a second-language phenomenon, but as a social phenomenon. A review of the social, demographic, and linguistic characteristics of Peruvian society from the early colonial period onward indicates that the necessary sociolinguistic conditions were not present in the colonial period in Peru. Only after a transition period (from the end of the eighteenth century to the end of the nineteenth century) were the social conditions in place for a contact variety to develop.",1,0

"En el presente trabajo se propone un acercamiento sociologico al problema de la planificacion linguistica, planteando una perspectiva fundamentada en una lectura de los avances de la sociolinguistica desde la teoria de sistemas sociales. El enfoque comprende la planificacion linguistica como una estrategia de regulacion del contacto linguistico que opera en los sistemas de interaccion –o sea, en la practica comunicativa de los hablantes–. Este se aplica, a modo de ejemplo, a distintas aristas de la planificacion del mapudungun, el sami y el maori. Se concluye que la planificacion se ejecuta mediante la introduccion en el entorno de los sistemas de interaccion de distinciones (hablar/no hablar, ensenar/no ensenar, etc.) que pretenden reorientar la operacion de los sistemas. Se destaca la relevancia de la consideracion de las condiciones sociohistoricas del contacto y la regulacion en el analisis de estos procesos. Adicionalmente, se advierte que el analisis de los casos latinoamericanos debe tener en cuenta que los procesos de diferenciacion funcional de estas sociedades tienen caracteristicas particulares, lo que las lleva a estructurarse de un modo distinto a aquellas sociedades como las europeas.",1,0

"With more and more importance being attached to English since China's economic reform and opening up to the outside world in the late 1970s, the entire Chinese society has placed such high importance to the learning of English that at times it even plays a vital role for a person who plans to pursue further education and seek a better career ( China Daily , 5 August, 2010). However, the end of 2013 saw an ‘unanticipated’ reform of policy on the National Matriculation English Test (henceforth, NMET) instituted by the Chinese Ministry of Education (henceforth, MOE). It was ‘unanticipated’ because in the past few years the Chinese government has invested heavily in English language teaching. As reported by ABC News (15 November, 2010), ‘China is pushing its people to learn English’, and English has thus occupied a prominent place in the life of the Chinese people because it is the ‘key’ to success (Chen, 2008: 16-37). According to this new policy, the once favorite ‘son’, i.e. English, may lose its predominance in the Chinese foreign language landscape and its importance may be diminished in exams. These changes are likely to cause a series of chain reactions since the dominant position of English largely lies in its weight in various levels of exams, with the NMET having the greatest impact. Given the determining factor of the NMET in Chinese people's attitudes towards English, NMET reform would almost undoubtedly change the current situation of English in China and it would be no exaggeration to say that it will have a foreseeable impact on various aspects of Chinese social life as well. In this article, I briefly review the causes for the ‘focus shift’ and attempt an analysis of the impact of the role of English in China in the future.",1,0

"A corpus of French tales is presented. Its two parts, a text corpus and a speech corpus, were designed for studying the relationships between the textual structures of tales and speech prosody, with the targeted application of an expressive text-to-speech synthesis system embedded in a humanoid robot. The 89-tale text corpus, and the 12-tale speech corpus were annotated using a common tale description framework. Lexical level annotations include extended definitions of enumerations, time, place and person named entities, as well as part of speech tags. Supra-lexical level annotations include the segmentation of tales into a sequence of episodes, the localization and attribution of direct quotations, together with tale protagonists co-references. Annotation distributions and inter-annotator agreement were analyzed. The largest coverage and strongest agreement were observed for person named entities, characters’ direct quotations, and their associated coreference chains. Speech corpus annotations were extended to allow the analysis of the relations between tale linguistic information and prosodic properties observed in associated speech. Word and phoneme boundaries were inferred through semi-automatic procedures, resulting in linguistic annotations aligned with the speech signal. Intonation stylization models were used to ease the visual and statistical analysis of tale’s prosody. Additional meta-information is provided with the speech corpus, allowing describing tale characters according to their gender, age, size, valence and kind.

"Abstract Modern human beings process information symbolically, rearranging mental symbols according to rules to envision multiple potential realities. They also express the ideas they form using structured articulate language. No other living creature does either of these things, reflecting a qualitative cognitive gulf between modern Homo sapiens and all the other species – including their own closest living relatives – that compose the Great Tree of Life. Yet it is evident that we are descended from a non-symbolic and non-linguistic ancestor. How did this astonishing transformation occur? Scrutiny of the fossil and archaeological records suggests that the transition to symbolic reasoning happened very late in hominid history – indeed, within the tenure of anatomically recognizable Homo sapiens . It was evidently not simply a passive result of the increase in brain size that typified multiple lineages of the genus Homo over the Pleistocene. I thus propose that a brain exaptively capable of complex symbolic manipulation and Universal Grammar was acquired as a byproduct of the major developmental reorganization that gave rise to the anatomically distinctive species H. sapiens , and that this new capacity was later recruited through the action of a cultural stimulus. In evolutionary terms this would have been a rather routine happening: after all, structures must necessarily be in place before they can be used for new purposes. Given the intimate interdependence of modern cognition and language – both are intrinsically symbolic activities – the most plausible cultural trigger for symbolic thought processes was the invention of language in an African isolate of H. sapiens at (very approximately) 100,000 years ago.

提要 本文着重分析了“V+向”类结构的词汇化，并从介词并入角度进行了跨语言的比较。“向”经历了由动转介的语法化过程，介词“向”萌芽于两汉，到魏晋南北朝完成介词化，到唐五代时期，“向”的介词功能最终确定并且稳固下来，完成了向介词演变的漫长的语法化道路。通过介词并入，“V+向”结构也经历了词汇化过程，互信息值计算和语感调查的结果都表明“V+向”词汇化程度比较高，是典型的介词并入现象。“V+向”类结构融合度的高低，与三个因素有关，即“V”、“向”、“O”的类型及其互动有关，“V”对“向”、“O”具有选择性，“O”对“V”具有反作用。根据介词并入相关理论对其他语言的考察表明，介词并入在其他语言中也存在。汉语的“V+向”结构中的“向”通过介词并入，“向”并入动词，在原来的空位留下一个语迹。这是形式上的并入，也是句法-语义上的并入。介词“向”并入，是词汇化的手段之一，其前提是“向”的语法化的完成。,1,0

"Le linguiste, dans sa volonté explicite de s'imposer comme sujet scientifique et de décrire objectivement la langue comme un objet qui lui est extérieur, est paradoxal, parce que, du fait même qu'il est habité de sa langue, il se trouve nécessairement dans l'impossibilité de remplir la tâche qu'il se propose. Le paradoxe du linguiste consiste donc en cela que, si on se permet de paraphraser l'observation de Labov, « les faits de la langue s'étudient selon la vision de tel ou tel linguiste individuel, alors que le linguiste n'existe que par son expérience personnelle des faits linguistiques ». Cela signifie très simplement que le linguiste, en tant que descripteur d'une langue, n'est opératif qu'à l'intérieur de son objet d'analyse. La crédibilité de l'analyste dépend entièrement de la position éthique qu'il prendra vis-à-vis de sa recherche.",1,0
"This is an unusual book. For one thing, it is huge: two volumes, over 1000 pages, with articles on fifty different languages or groups. For another, the list of contributors is quite diverse, including a few phonologists with specific language interests (Shmuel Bolozky, Robert D. Hoberman, Maria-Rosa Lloret and Joseph L. Malone), a few linguists who are better known for their work in areas other than phonology (Bernard Comrie, Jeffrey Heath, H. Craig Melchert and Johanna Nichols) and a group of distinguished experts on particular languages or families (including Giorgio Buccellati, Gene Gragg, Robert Hetzron, Wolf Leslau, Paul Newman and others). The goals of this book are also a bit unusual. In his introduction, the editor says this: The idea for this volume came about as I searched in vain for a book which would enable my students to gain a concrete familiarity of solid phonological work by subjecting them to the exposure of many of today's (hard-)working linguists who would concisely describe and comment on the phonological processes in and structures of languages which they have carefully scrutinized, both ancient or medieval and modern. (p. xvi) This is an attractive concept; undergraduate and beginning graduate students would undoubtedly benefit from studying and perhaps attempting to reanalyse a carefully presented description of the phonemic system and morphophonemic processes of an unfamiliar language. More advanced graduate students or established scholars could also benefit from having access to compact descriptions that summarise potentially interesting phenomena and give references to consult for further research.",1,0

"1 Notes on the Synchronic Phonology 2 of Nauruan 3 Lev Blumenfeld 4 CARLETON UNIVERSITY 5 This article proposes an analysis of several aspects of Nauruan synchronic 6 phonology. It establishes inventories and contrasts among consonants and 7 vowels, and offers an analysis of the stress system. Underlying quantity 8 and quality contrasts are obscured by allophonic processes affecting vowels, 9 but can be revealed if stress information is taken into account. A Nauruan 10 Swadesh list is supplied in the appendix. 11 Keywords: Nauruan; Stress; Quantity; Micronesian 12 1. INTRODUCTION.1 13 1.1. LANGUAGE, DATA, AND PRIOR WORK. Nauruan is a Micronesian 14 language spoken by just under 10,000 people in the Republic of Nauru and 15 by diaspora communities elsewhere (Eberhard, Simons, and Fennig 2021). 16 Linguistics research on Nauruan has been less extensive than on its 17 Micronesian relatives. The ethnographic description of Hambruch (1914– 18 1915) and the grammar by Kayser (1993 [1937]) provide some early resources. 19 In the 1970s, Nathan and colleagues began the search for Austronesian cog20 nates (Nathan 1973a), and took the initial steps toward a synchronic description 21 (Nathan 1973b; Hough 1974). Fieldwork focused on the classifier system was 22 carried out by Johnson (1999, 2002). More recently, two researchers visited 23 Nauru for on-site fieldwork. The fruits of that work are now becoming avail24 able: Blumenfeld, Burness, and Riley (2015) and Blumenfeld (2017) proposed 25 a new analysis of Nauruan stress and length, and Hughes investigated the syn26 chrony and diachrony of Nauruan phonology, culminating in his PhD thesis 27 (Hughes 2020). Among other results, Hughes established the classification 28 of Nauruan as a Micronesian language. The present sketch builds on this work, 29 and offers a phonemicization of Nauruan with special attention to stress and 30 quantity. 1. I am grateful to my Nauruan consultants, audiences at COOL10, LSA, MOT, to Kevin Hughes, Ken Rehg, and to my Carleton colleagues for helpful comments. I am especially gratefult to Alamanda Lauti for continuing help with all aspects of my work with Nauruan. The work was supported in part by an SSHRC Insight Development Grant #430-2013-000826. Oceanic Linguistics, Volume 61, no. 2 (December 2022)© by University of Hawai‘i Press. All rights reserved. 31 The materials used in this sketch the description include the following: 32 (i) word lists in carrier phrases (about 600 items); (ii) recordings of possessive 33 paradigms of directly possessed nouns; (iii) recordings of stories and legends 34 from a printed collection (Detudamo n.d.); (iv) a recording of about 6000 head35 words from Jacob et al. (1996), a draft of the Nauruan dictionary, collected 36 for a dictionary project; and (v) recordings of approximately eighty hours of 37 morphosyntactic elicitation. The data were collected over several visits to 38 Nauru between 2014 and 2018 (four months total time on site), with five speak39 ers aged between thirty-five and seventy, with the majority of data coming from 40 two speakers in their forties and fifties. A significant portion of the data resulted 41 from a collaborative project with the local community on re-digitizing an old 42 dictionary draft (Jacob et al. 1996). Spontaneous speech is conspicuously lack43 ing on this list, but I believe that a reasonable analysis of the phonology can be 44 made with the data available. 45 In the remainder of this section, I discuss general methodological issues. 46 Consonant inventory is discussed in section 2, and vowels in section 3. The 47 stress system, which ties the analysis together, is introduced in section 4, with 48 evidence, analysis, and predictions. While the present treatment is in substantial 49 agreement with that of Hughes (2020), there are some differences, which are dis50 cussed in section 5. I conclude with brief notes on Micronesian parallels of 51 Nauruan patterns and on the orhtography. The appendix supplies a Swadesh list. 52 1.2. A NOTE ON DESCRIPTIVE GOALS.

"Abstract This paper is a rejoinder to Steffensen (this journal issue: pp. 105–119). It is a discussion of some convergences and divergences between dialogism (dialogical theories) and the Distributed Language Approach (DLA). I argue that Steffensen tends to overstate these differences. But there are also some points where consensus is lacking. The paper focuses on three points. One is about what non-localisability of meaning actually amounts to. I suggest that this is chiefly a terminological issue. A more important controversy concerns sense-makings and their place in human existence. Here, DLA – in Steffensen's version – seems to look at sense-making as immersed in biological life, while dialogism treats sense-making (and related phenomena like culture, agency, consciousness and morality) as more definitional of humanity. However, there is also a trend towards an ‘extended’ dialogism, in which the embodiment of interactivity is assigned a very fundamental role. A third issue concerns the role of individuals and individualism within dialogism. In this regard, I claim that dialogism is basically an anti-individualist meta-theory, but this does not imply that individuals do not exist in a dialogically constituted world. On the contrary, both social and cultural relations and individuality are products of human interactivities.",1,0

"Abstract Taking the concept of semanalysis as Julia Kristeva’s proposition of a cross-disciplinary work on that which is trans- beneath-, and also beyond the linguistic, it is logical and inevitable to read its psychoanalytic stems, specifically from Sigmund Freud and Jacques Lacan, along with their further dispersal and redirection or utilization in poststructuralist feminism. This article shows how the playing field of these interacting lines re-elucidates Kristeva’s concept of semiotic also as providing with a political dimension the sought out “deeper and hidden meanings”. Further, the article argues that the poststructuralist profiling - Lacan’s semioticizing Freud, Kristeva’s rewriting their common equaling of women with negative/death/lack/void and her further tuning with Helene Cixous and Luce Irigaray, - reveals what semanalysis is about, and what it can lead to. The article also looks for a possible actualization of semanalysis along with Rosi Braidotti's nomadic matter-realist thought.",1,0

"Most acceptability judgments reported in the syntactic literature are obtained by linguists being their own informants. For well-represented languages like English, this method of data collection is best described as a process of community agreement, given that linguists typically discuss their judgments with colleagues. However, the process itself is comparably opaque, and the reliability of its output has been questioned. Recent studies looking into this criticism have shown that judgments reported in the literature for English can be replicated in quantitative experiments to a near-perfect degree. However, the focus of those studies has been on testing sentence pairs. We argue that replication of only contrasts is not sufficient, because theory building necessarily includes comparison across pairs and across papers. Thus, we test items at large, i. e. independent of counterparts. We created a corpus of grammaticality judgments on sequences of American English reported in articles published in Linguistic Inquiry and then collected experimental ratings for a random subset of them. Overall, expert ratings and experimental ratings converge to a good degree, but there are numerous instances in which ratings do not converge. Based on this, we argue that for theory-critical data, the process of community agreement should be accompanied by quantitative methods whenever possible.",1,0

"R EALISTICALLY, THE LEXICOGRAPHER ABOUT TO OBSERVE the language faces close to a billion people engaged in linguistic events in English each day (McCrum, MacNeil, and Cran 1986, 3). Only by dint of the sparsest sampling procedures can the lexicographer hope to turn away from the cacophony of utterance long enough to fashion a dictionary. This highly selective attention both permits and determines the dictionary. Yet insofar as the discretionary process is buried from view in the editorial offices of the publisher, the user of the dictionary is tempted to imagine the sort of comprehensiveness which Gove is addressing. I suspect that the authoritativeness of the dictionary may unduly rest on this imagined comprehensiveness. To know exactly which utterances are attended to-though most of them are not so much uttered as published-is not only to realize the claim of the dictionary on the language but to perceive the manner in which the language's continuing development is monitored and recognized, if not always sanctioned. This inquiry would meet the mythical comprehensiveness of the dictionary with a description of the realistic limitations of actual lexicographical practice. To portray the current state of those practices, I have conducted interviews on current editorial practices with the senior lexicographical staff of five publishers of English language dictionaries in the United States, England, and Canada.' The reading and marking programs at Houghton Mifflin, Merriam-Webster, Random House, Oxford University Press, and Gage make it clear that if lexicographers cannot possibly scrutinize everything, they have learned to trust certain sources, to seek system and standards, to categorically exclude some while tripping onto others, each in their own search and in their own way. Yet to report on these ways is not to knock over the screen hiding the Wizard of Oz anxiously working the levers and wires of his apparent greatness. As Gove's comment",1,0
"The main aim of this volume, a collection of contributions by different authors,
is to illustrate that dictionary making draws on other disciplines, and that lexicographical
practice, in its turn, can feed neighbouring disciplines. The authors
assert that linguistics is the basic discipline underlying lexicography, but the
practice of dictionary making can, vice versa, expose problems of language
analysis and especially crucial features of language, which should be taken into
consideration in language theory. Often, lexicographical practice is characterized
by devising ad hoc solutions to such problems that might positively influence
the stringent and consistent approach in theoretical studies. In this sense,
the relation between lexicography and linguistics should be seen as a mutual
one, with possibilities of cross-fertilization in both ways. The authors want to
show which trends in theoretical linguistics could be, or have already been,
reflected in the compilation of dictionaries. They also want to demonstrate that
many branches of linguistics, from semantics, via phraseology to syntax, can be
enriched by lexicographical description and problems of lexicographical description.
According to the introduction of the volume, the subtitle, between
'common sense' and applied theory, especially characterizes the nature of lexicography
practised in a meaningful way on the one hand, and on the other
aptly refers to lexicographers themselves in their daily task.",1,0

"The interest in machine-learning methods to solve natural-language-understanding problems has led to the use of textual annotation as an important auxiliary technique. Grammar induction based on annotation has been very successful for the Penn Treebank, where a corpus of English text was annotatedwith syntactic information. This shining example has inspired a plethora of annotation efforts: corpora are annotated for ‘coreference’, for animacy, for expressions of opinions, for temporal dependencies, for the estimated duration of the activities that the expressions refer to, and so on. It is not clear though that these efforts are bound to repeat the success of the Penn Treebank. The circumstances in which the Penn Treebank project was executed are vastly different from those in which most annotation tasks take place. First, the annotation was a linguistic task and one about which there is reasonable agreement. People might quibble about the way to represent certain constituent structure distinctions in English, but they do, in general, not disagree about the distinctions themselves; and if you don’t like the Treebank as is, you can translate it into your favorite format. Second, theworkwas done by advanced students who understood the task andwere supervised by specialists in the field. Third, this was not done in a hurry. The project started in 1989 and the corpora are still maintained and the annotations improved. About the only thing that this project has in common with the bulk of annotation tasks is that the annotators were not very well paid. Currently, we see annotation schemas being developed for phenomena that are much less well understood than constituent structure. In workshops and conferences we hear lively discussions about interannotator agreement, about tools to make the annotation task easier, about how to cope with multiple annotations of the same text, about the development of international standards for annotation schemes in specific subdomains, and, most importantly, about the statistical models that can be built once the annotations are in place. One thing that is much less discussed is whether the annotation indeed helps isolate the property that motivated it in the first place. This is not the same as interannotator agreement. For interannotator agreement, it suffices that all annotators do the same thing. But even with full annotator agreement it is not sure that the task captures what was initially intended. Assume that I want to mark all the entities in a text that refer to the same entity with the same number and I tell my annotators “Whenever you see the word Chicago, give it the same number”: I’ll get great interannotator agreement with that guideline but it is debatable whether I will realize my proclaimed aim of classifying references to one and the same entity in the outside world. Presumably, I would like to catch all the references to the city of Chicago, but Chicago pizza is made and sold all over the United States, and the relation",1,0

Students found the experience of receiving feedback from multiple sources useful. The kinds of feedback they described were analysed within the categories: lessons learnt; interaction; and the affective domain. Many of the key trends in the literature on feedback were affirmed. However, several prevailing assumptions, for example that academics do not comment on language or the use of writing conventions, were called into question by the study. The key differences between the three different sources of feedback were found to be the forms of interaction, and what these different ways of communicating and interacting made possible with regard to student learning.

"Federal legislation (White House Executive Order 13166, 2000) mandates that language services be provided to limited English proficient populations by health care providers receiving federal funding. In order to do this, some basic resources have been developed to administer medical services. Nevertheless, the translation aspects of these guidelines often lack many components that would be necessary to assure the functional adequacy of the translated text (e.g., cultural, pragmatic, and textual appropriateness). Furthermore, outside the medical field, guidelines and legislation are often nonexistent. In the absence of specific requirements for translation and/or translator qualifications, research suggests that translators, in particular novice, unexperienced translators, tend to adopt a literal, linguistic, micro-approach to the translation task, failing to consider global or pragmatic factors (Colina, 1997, 1999; Jääskeläinen, 1989, 1990, 1993; Königs, 1987; Krings, 1987; Kussmaul, 1995; Lörscher, 1991, 1992a, 1992b, 1997; Tirkkonen-Condit & Jääskeläinen, 1991). Given the scarcity of educational programs in translation and the frequent use of untrained bilinguals to produce translated materials in Arizona, we hypothesized that documents translated in educational settings would not be functionally adequate. Using a sample corpus of educational materials for the Spanish-speaking population, we show that this is indeed the case. We demonstrate that a structural, literal approach is inadequate for educational purposes and often negatively affects educational outcomes. The effectiveness of the translated materials with regard to global considerations and purpose is vital, especially in regard to parental involvement as a key factor in a student's success. More adequate guidelines need to be developed regarding requirements for translations and translator training. Additional implications for education and policy creation for language-minority populations are discussed.",1,0

"Les interférences linguistiques créées par les étudiants de langue seconde sont depuis toujours une discussion importante dans le domaine de l’acquisition de langue. La présente étude vise à analyser les problèmes de prononciation des consonnes de l’anglais /b/, /d/, /g/, /dʒ/, /j/ et /ð/ par les locuteurs javanais dans une université malaisienne. 30 personnes de divers départements dans l’université ont été interrogées. Les étudiants javanais étaient invités pendant l’entretien à prononcer les consonnes problématiques sous forme de mots, propositions et phrases. Les prononciations produites par les étudiants javanais ont été analysées par un analyseur spectrographique appelé Praat afin de comparer les différences entre celles produites et celles des natifs. Le résultat confirme que certaines caractéristiques acoustiques produites par les locuteurs javanais influencent leurs prononciations en anglais. Il démontre également que les phonèmes /dʒ/ et /j/ n’ont pas pu être correctement prononcés par les interrogés car les caractéristiques acoustiques du javanais persistent. Cependant, les phonèmes /b/ et /g/ ont pu être correctement prononcés alors que les phonèmes /dʒ/ et /j/ l’ont été avec une difficulté moyenne. Ainsi le résultat confirme-t‑il que l’accent de la première langue joue un rôle important dans la prononciation de la langue seconde.Mots-clés : interférences de première langue, langue seconde, accents javanais, étude acoustique.",1,0
"Predictability and consistency are requirements that should run like a golden thread through the macro-, medio- as well as the microstructure of dictionary articles. Adherence to these requirements is one of the marks of a user-friendly reference work that will allow for easy access and trouble-free retrieval of required information. This article aims to investigate some features of Endemann's (1911) Wörterbuch der Sotho-Sprache (Dictionary of the Sotho language) with the focus on challenges of predictability and consistency in the lemmatization approach, the access alphabet, cross references and article treatments. The dictionary has hitherto remained at the outskirts of scholarly investigation, one of the reasons being the fact that the target language is German and that, as such, it is not readily accessible to every scholar of the Bantu languages. A further reason is that it is aimed at subject specialists rather than the general public and places a high demand on the lexicographic skill of the user. Some interesting insights can be gained from this example of an early attempt at dictionary compilation and its shortcomings can serve as a springboard for continual improvement of access routes and user-friendliness of dictionaries in the Sotho languages.",1,0

"0.1 For some ten years now, it has been my claim that it was through linguistic writings of his time, and not through extra-linguistic publications, that Saussure’s views took shape. This is not to say that there was no influence on him from disciplines other than linguistics, but this kind of influence was due to what I have termed the “climate of opinion” of the period, and it remained largely at the surface of things, certain frequently reiterated claims of a strong impact of Durkheim’s sociology, Tarde’s as well as Walras’ political economy, etc. notwithstanding (cf. Rijlaarsdam 1978: 260-64; Bierbach 1978 passim). Saussure’s acquaintance with disciplines outside linguistics, I maintain, was at best second-hand and remained superficial. This is not only true of the psychologism underlying his theoretical argument, a psychologism found elsewhere in the linguistic literature (e.g., Paul 1880, 1909; Baudouin de Courtenay 1894), but also of his sociologism, his repeated statement that language was a “fait social”. In short, if we want to place Saussure’s theory of language-and of linguistics for that matter-in an epistemological context, we would do better by acquainting ourselves with the linguistic literature of his day rather than deducing from certain superficial similarities and terminological borrowings a direct influence of a field outside the study of language on Saussure’s linguistic reasoning. (We should remember that Saussure never wrote a book on general linguistics, but that he was trying, through comparisons, metaphors, and references to what was general knowledge of his day, to convey his largely novel ideas to twenty-year-old students.)",1,0

"Abstract An estimated 390,000 to 520,000 individuals with severe aphasia (IWSA) currently live in the United States. IWSA experience profound social isolation, which is associated with a wide range of negative health outcomes, including mortality. Treatments for severe aphasia frequently focus on compensatory communication approaches or a discrete communication act rather than on participation-based treatment. The purpose of this study was to determine whether IWSA demonstrated improved performance on standardized language measures, patient-reported outcome measures, and connected speech samples as a result of client-centered conversation group treatment. Results of assessments conducted at pretreatment, posttreatment, and maintenance intervals were variable across participants. All participants demonstrated improvement in at least one of the outcome measures considered. Importantly, none of these measures fully captured how IWSA were able to convey their thoughts in supported conversation. The results lend support for the use of conversation treatment for, and for further study in, this subpopulation of individuals with aphasia.",1,0

"Les auteurs approfondissent les recherches réalisées à ce jour sur la pédagogie basée sur les concepts en étudiant l’usage du concept grammatical d’aspect comme instrument médiateur de la prise de décisions dans le cadre de tâches. Ils rapportent plus précisément les résultats d’une étude de cas longitudinale dans laquelle ils se penchent sur les explications d’un étudiant quant à son choix du temps passé français (passé composé ou imparfait). Parmi les données qu’ils recueillent au moyen d’enregistrements audio figurent les échanges chercheur-étudiant sur les réponses écrites de l’étudiant aux tâches qui lui ont été assignées et dont il s’est acquitté avant et après une heure de cours sur le concept d’aspect. Les résultats de l’exercice révèlent une évolution dans les explications de l’étudiant. Avant le cours, l’étudiant utilise des règles empiriques formelles, mais la terminologie conceptuelle apparaît dans ses explications immédiatement après le cours. Quatre semaines après le cours, l’étudiant justifie ses choix en mettant l’accent avant tout sur le sens qu’il souhaite communiquer. Plus important encore, il s’appuie sur une méthode qu’il a lui-même élaborée, à partir d’un raisonnement logique, pour expliquer ses décisions quant aux formes du verbe.

En este estudio descriptivo-explicativo se aplicó un instrumento de 30 palabras para medir el procesamiento léxico a partir de la lectura de la frecuencia de palabras (ruta directa) y la lectura de seudopalabras (ruta indirecta). Los resultados muestran que los niños de ambos sexos, hasta los 11 años reconocen con facilidad las palabras de alta frecuencia (AF) en relación a las palabras de baja frecuencia (BF). A los 12 años existe un equilibrio entre la frecuencia de ambos tipos de palabras; sin embargo, no hubo diferencias en la comparación entre seudopalabras, además el reconocimiento de palabras por la vía directa evidenció un mejor rendimiento en relación a la vía indirecta. La edad cronológica es una variable determinante para alcanzar mejores resultados sobre la lectura de palabras de BF y seudopalabras de alta y baja frecuencia.",1,0

"Résumé: Cette étude avait comme objectif de mettre à l’essai une tâche de répétition de non-mots destinée à une population francophone auprès d’une population dont la langue d’origine n’est pas le français. Un groupe de locuteurs de langues d’origine (n = 27) a été apparié à un groupe de locuteurs natifs du français (n = 27) possédant des connaissances lexicales réceptives comparables. Nous avons comparé les résultats des deux groupes à une tâche de répétition de non-mots. Les résultats des analyses de variance indiquent que les participants de langues d’origine ont obtenu des résultats équivalents à ceux des locuteurs natifs, et ce malgré le fait que leur langue d’origine ne soit pas celle à partir de laquelle les non-mots ont été construits. Cette étude met en lumière la possibilité d’utilisation d’une tâche de répétition de non-mots auprès d’une population linguistiquement hétérogène, tout en fournissant des pistes de réflexion relativement à l’unité de mesure qui devrait être privilégiée, soit la mesure de syllabes réussies, afin de tenter de limiter le plus possible l’influence de différents facteurs pouvant intervenir lors de la réalisation de la tâche.",1,0

"Samuel Johnson and the Journey into Words by Lynda Mugglestone John Considine (bio) Samuel Johnson and the Journey into Words by Lynda Mugglestone. Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 2015. Pp. xi + 290. $40.00. ISBN: 978-0-19-967990-4. Participants in a dictionary conference co-organized by Lynda Mugglestone in the year in which this book was published found a keepsake in their conference packages: a little square mat of the sort on which one puts a cup or glass, inscribed COASTER (n.s.) He that sails timorously near the shore. Samuel Johnson, A Dictionary of the English Language (1755).1 Those coasters anticipated this book in two ways: they encouraged their readers to think about Johnson's sense of his own work and about the connectedness of the words which he handled. Johnson's sense of his own work is revealed by the surprising word in his definition of coaster, which is ""timorously"": there were obvious ordinary reasons for many seagoing vessels in the eighteenth century to stay within sight of the coast. To be sure, the definition is motivated by the sole quotation which follows, from Dryden: ""In our small skiff we must not launch too far; | We here but coasters, not discov'rers are."" But the second of the two quotations in the previous entry, for the transitive verb coast, in which Addison writes of the pleasures of coasting the shore of Italy, had just told Johnson that not all coasting is timorous. He had his own reasons to see coasting as a metaphor for a poor, timorous activity, and to see himself as a discoverer on the wide seas. Those reasons give Samuel Johnson and the Journey into Words its opening, which introduces some of Johnson's imagery of himself as traveler and discoverer, and some of the imagery which precedes it in monolingual and bilingual dictionaries of English, in a sequence which runs backwards from Edward Phillips's New World of English Words of 1658 to the text by Thomas Blount in which Phillips found the image, and thence to John Florio's Worlde of Wordes of 1598. Mugglestone reflects here that the English language is, for Johnson, ""variously a territory [End Page 123] to be conquered, and a terrain to be laboriously traversed"" (16). The second chapter has the Plan of a Dictionary of 1747 at its center, and attends in particular to the shaping of the Plan in two preliminary manuscripts by Johnson and in the annotations on them by the Earl of Chesterfield, Johnson's old friend John Taylor of Ashbourne, and others. Images of the lexicographer's conquest of a language and his authority over it are again relevant here. The third chapter turns to Johnson's reading for the Dictionary, with an eye to his images of travel, and the fourth to questions of the exercise of prescriptive authority in the dictionary, with some excellent material on Johnson's acceptance of variation, particularly in spelling. The fifth turns to Johnson's definitions, describing the subtle interplay of description and prescription in the Dictionary, and arguing against the not-yet-extinct view of his procedure as basically dogmatic and prescriptive. (Mugglestone does not, of course, deny that Johnson sometimes condemned usage rather than reporting it neutrally, and gives some nice examples, such as his objection to Gay's image of turnips which ""hide their swelling heads"" in the ground: the head, Johnson felt, must be the highest part of an entity.) The sixth addresses Johnson's treatment of loanwords at different stages of naturalization, again showing his readiness to be flexible, and suggesting his own inconsistency in the treatment of a subject in which it is so hard to be consistent. A seventh chapter turns to Johnson's vision in the Dictionary of the history, and hence the unstable quality, of the English language, as opposed to the ideal of stability which appears in the Plan, pointing out, for instance, the appearance of the early Middle English chronicler Robert of Gloucester in a couple of dictionary entries as well as in the preliminary history of the language (173–74). It would have been possible to say more about...",1,0

"In this article, we investigate the discursive transformations that occurred at a migrant-support non-governmental organisation (NGO) located in the outskirts of Barcelona (Catalonia, Spain) and how they intersect with broader sociopolitical and economic processes. In particular, we focus on the revamping of the key notions of language and labour in the institutional imagination of migrant incorporation processes. Our data was collected over the course of a six-year period (2007–2012) and consisted of in-depth interviews with multilingual NGO users and institutional agents, ethnographic narratives and institutional documents. We trace a discursive shift from ‘integration-through-labour’ during the economic boom to an official ‘integration-through-language’ to gain access to paid employment in the early years of the recession, and recently, with the worsening of the crisis, a paradigm that focuses on language-cum-affective labour to craft relational and moral selves through voluntary work in local NGOs.",1,0

"In this article, we propose a pluralistic approach to the explanation of social understanding that integrates literature from social psychology with the theory of mind debate. Social understanding in everyday life is achieved in various ways. As a rule of thumb we propose that individuals make use of whatever procedure is cognitively least demanding to them in a given context. Aside from theory and simulation, associations of behaviors with familiar agents play a crucial role in social understanding. This role has been neglected so far. We illustrate the roles of fluency and associations in social understanding in false belief tasks.",1,0

"Abstract Drawing on two longitudinal case-studies, this study aimed to identify some salient characteristics of the agentic behaviour of two young emergent multilinguals in two different multilingual contexts: Luxembourg and Israel. Despite the fact that the studies were conducted independently, the two cases were analysed together owing to the similarities in the research methods such as video-recorded observations, and semi-structured interviews with teachers and parents. The data were analysed through thematic and conversational analyses. Findings showed that a boy who learned Luxembourgish in Luxembourg and a girl who learned Hebrew in Israel, were outgoing and active learners who influenced their learning environment. We identified 10 types of agentic behaviour, including engaging in repetition after peers and the teacher, creatively producing language, translanguaging, and self-monitoring. Despite differences of the children’s sociocultural and linguistic backgrounds, and the language policies of their educational settings, we found a striking overlap in their language-based agentic behaviours. We suggest that the identified types can encourage further research in this field. Although our study with talkative children allowed us to observe many types of agentic behaviours, we cannot claim that less outgoing children or children who do not show the same behaviours do not have ways of expressing their agency.",1,0

"A PROPOS DE PREMIERES FIXATIONS DES ETHNONYMES LITUANIEN, LETTON, ESTONIEN DANS LA LANGUE FRANÇAISERésuméLe présent article est consacré à l’analyse historique de trois ethnonymes Lituanien, Letton, Estonien et leurs versions dans les sources littéraires et lexicographiques de la langue française.On note une grande quantité de variantes pour ces trois ethnonymes, notamment pour le LITUA­NIEN – 4 (Lithuanien, Litvanien, Lithvanien); pour l’ESTONIEN – 5 (Esthonien, Eeste, Estien, Esthe), Pour le LETTON – 8 (Lettonien, Latvien, Latavien, Lette, Lettien, Latyche, Loche). Ces variantes s’expliquent:1) par une influence des langues voisines (russe – Latyche; allemand – Lette);2) par des raisons linguo-politiques (Letton/Latvien);3) par des facteurs linguistiques:a) phonétiques (Lituanien/Lithuanien/Litvanien; Estonien /Esthonien; Este/Esthe);b) morphologiques (Lette/Lettonieni/Lettien; Este/Estien). Comme le démontre le matériel analysé ces ethnonymes ont pénétré dans trois langues baltes graduellement, à partir de la première moitié du XV-e siècle, quand le chevalier Guilbert de LANNOY visita cette région et laissa ses mémoires de voyages pour les générations à venir.",1,0

抽象 本文從焦點–重音匹配的角度來探討漢語日常口語中「把」字句謂語部分的複雜性。本文認為，與一般 [PP V] 結構不同，「把」字句是為了在句子層面上把位於「把」NP 後的謂語部分處理為資訊焦點而產生的一種特殊句式，而實現為資訊焦點的必要條件就是必須得到句法結構提供的核心重音。由於「把」字句中「把」後 NP 是謂語動詞的論元，其後的謂語部分只有在句法上形成分支結構才能夠得到核心重音，僅僅在韻律上形成分支結構是不夠的，因此光杆動詞和不形成句法分支的雙音節動詞都被排除在「把」字句之外。這個觀點也適用於其他動詞在尾的結構，例如被動句和「連…都」結構等。,1,0

"As acoes em defesa dos direitos humanos tem sua referencia principal na Declaracao Universal dos Direitos Humanos que surge apos a Segunda Guerra entre as Nacoes reunidas na Conferencia de Yalta, Ucrânia, em 1945, estabelecendo as bases de uma futura “paz”, definindo areas de influencia das potencias e a criacao de uma Organizacao multilateral que promova negociacoes sobre conflitos internacionais, para evitar guerras e promover a paz, a democracia e os Direitos Humanos. A Assembleia Geral das Organizacoes das Nacoes Unidas de 10 de dezembro de 1948 adotou a Declaracao Universal dos Direitos Humanos como base para a construcao de um novo mundo sustentado por ideias que promovessem a paz e evitassem a guerra. Atualmente, a luta pelos direitos humanos e a pesquisa cientifica tem ampliado os espacos de acao como o direito a moradia, ao acesso a educacao, etc. O objetivo deste trabalho e discutir os fundamentos historico-filosoficos adotados na Declaracao Universal dos Direitos Humanos e os processos socioculturais hoje presentes no debate sobre a elaboracao de novos direitos para a vivencia cidada e para discutirmos a dimensao etica da educacao como pressuposto de um novo projeto pedagogico para um mundo de paz. O estudo pretende contribuir na discussao sobre questoes relacionadas aos direitos humanos, principalmente na denuncia e luta contra o racismo, a homofobia, a fome, a exclusao social, a destruicao ambiental, enfim, contra todo tipo de violencia que atinge os seres humanos nos mais variados contextos. Nosso interesse e contribuir para o debate atual sobre os direitos humanos e o desenvolvimento de processos que educam para a convivencia humana, a inclusao social e a paz.",1,0

"This article examines the linguistic landscape (LL) of Dingle, the centre for a peripheral minority language community on the Southwestern seaboard of Ireland. Dingle is a popular touristic space located within the boundary of the Gaeltacht and for this reason offers a unique setting for the examination of issues prevalent in the sociolinguistics of globalization (cf. Blommaert 2010; Coupland 2010a) including authenticity and commodification. In particular these issues are examined through an analysis of linguistic and other semiotic resources that are drawn on in this touristic space. By mapping the LL the specific aim of the study is to plot the trajectory of the Irish language as a resource for indexing Dingle as an authentic tourist space. A qualitative approach to the data is taken in an effort to uncover the symbolic and cultural resources being activated in the LL of Dingle. The study highlights how minority languages, like Irish, get mobilized as valuable resources and commodities in the context of tourism and the potential impact of this for the local political economy of language.",1,0

"In modern democratic societies, political life is embodied through the actions of political parties, their duly elected leaders, and various political ideologies. In this context, political discourse, which records a variety of opinions and, frequently, their conflict, becomes an inseparable element of political culture.This article is aimed to identify linguistic metaphors and to reconstruct the conceptual metaphors which determine the origin of these linguistic metaphors in Gordon Brown’s political discourse. This study presents and examines conceptual metaphors and the identification of metaphorical expressions in Brown’s political texts. The majority of metaphorical expressions forms a particular system, which can be explained through their relations to conceptual metaphors—cognitive structures, existing in the sub-conscious, that determine the interpretation of the world and unfold through linguistic metaphorics.In Brown’s political discourse, the implied we–they opposition is actualized through metaphors. His political discourse, touches on two main political subjects—the Labour Party and the Conservatives. The denominations of these subjects are ideological in nature. The Prime Minister, on the base of the we–they model, attributes only positive features to the Labour Party and only negative ones to the Conservatives. The conceptual metaphors POLITICS IS WAR, POLITICS IS A JOURNEY and THE STATE IS A BUILDING prevail in Brown’s political discourse. These conceptual metaphors are generally typical of political discourse. Conceptual metaphors, which are the basis for text creation through linguistic metaphors, allow the features of a good leader to be attributed to Brown’s personality. His opponents are implicitly granted bad characteristics.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.5755/j01.sal.0.23.5428",1,0
"PERSONENNAMEN DER KURISCHEN NEHRUNG ALS ZEUGEN DER ETHNISCHEN ZUSAMMENSETZUNG DER BEVÖLKERUNGZusammenfassungIm vorliegenden Artikel wird die ethnische Zusammensetzung der Kurischen Nehrung (im Fol­genden: KN) anhand von registriertien Personennamen der Ortseinwohner untersucht. Die eingebürgerte Meinung, dass die Mehrheit der Einwohner der KN vom 15. bis zum 20. Jh. aus kurländischen Ein­siedlern und ihren Nachfolgern bestand, während Litauer und Deutsche einen wesentlich kleineren Bestandteil bildeten, wird meist mit der Tatsache der damals herrschenden Familiensprache (des ku­rischen Dialekts) begründet.Diese Position muss hinsichtlich der Einwohnerzusammensetzung nach den Personennamen korri­giert werden. Der nehrungskurische Dialekt wird für den eigenen von Menschen gehalten, die nicht nur für Kurland typische Personennamen wie Kakies, Pinkies, Sprogies, sondern auch deutsche Wiesel, Foege, Radmacher und litauische Naujoks, Kubilius, Karalius, Jakeit u. a. haben. Unter den Perso­nennamen findet man sowohl verslawischte Formen als auch mögliche Prußizismen. Kurland eigene Personennamen (kurische und lettische) des vorhandenen Materials bilden keine Mehrheit sogar im Hintergrund des baltischen Materials, gar nicht zu sprechen davon, dass die letzteren nur etwas mehr als einen Drittel aller Personennamen der KN ausmachen. Der kurische Subdialekt war im erwähnten Zeit­raum grundsätzlich zu einem Soziolekt geworden, den beinahe alle Fischerfamilien gesprochen haben, abgesehen von ihrer ethnischen Herkunft.713 Familiennamen der KN aus der Vorkriegszeit sind etymologisch analysiert worden. 282 Fami­liennamen werden wegen ihrer Herkunft und Bildung für baltisch gehalten. Bei 413 Familiennamen ist man der Meinung, dass sie ihre Herkunft anderen Sprachen (Deutsch, Slawisch und manchen anderen) bzw. christlichen Vornamen verdanken und keine Merkmale der baltischen Familiennamenbildung auf­weisen. Die Herkunft der restlichen Familiennamen konnte nicht festgestellt werden. 43 Familiennamen haben möglicherweise einige Etymologien von verschiedenen Sprachen.Bildungsgemäß sind ausschließlich Familiennamen der baltischen Bildung analysiert worden (220). Die Suffixbildung ist die umfangreichste Art: 133 Familiennamen haben 25 baltische Personennamen­suffixe. Am produktivsten ist das patronymische Suffix -ait- (54): 15 ihrer Ableitungen sind baltischer Herkunft, 20 germanischer Herkunft, 18 stammen von Personennamen, und die Herkunft von einer Ab­leitung ist unklar. Man kann dieses Suffix für das typischste Merkmal nicht nur bei der Bildung der Patronyme von regionalen Personennamen halten, sondern auch bei der Bildung von Familiennamen fremder Herkunft und in vielen Fällen bei der Integration von Menschen verschiedener Herkunft in der baltischen Region. Andere bildende Suffixe sind -ĭn-/-īn-, -ulis, -eikis, -ulait, -ut-, -ik-, -ĭm-/-īm-. In KN findet man Suffixe, die nicht nur einzelnen baltischen Sprachen, sondern auch der größeren westbalti­schen Region eigen sind (-ain-, -al-, -eik-, -ĭm-/-īm-, -ĭt-/-īt-, -uk-, -ut). Das Material der lettischen und prußischen Sprachen bestätigen ihre Verbreitung. Als lettisch gelten die Suffixe -ān-, -eņš-, als litauisch -išk-, -ulait-, -užait- und -už-. Man hat 110 nichtabgeleitete Familiennamen gefunden. 3 Familiennamen sind von zusammengesetzten baltischen Vornamen erhalten geblieben. Andere sind in den baltischen Sprachen registrierte Appellativa, die Familiennamen geworden sind. Nichtabgeleitete Familiennamen haben die meisten Entsprechungen im Namenverzeichnis anderer litauischen Regionen. Ca. 40 Perso­nennamen gelten hier als Endungsableitungen, z. B., Szmukszta, Kiaups, Skirbe, Schakkis u. a. Zusam­mengesetzte Familiennamen bilden keine große Klasse (15), darunter gibt es sowohl litauische als auch lettische, z. B., Jaudzims, außerdem weisen manche auch kurische Merkmale auf, z. B., Melwingis.Frauenfamiliennamen fallen in offiziellen Quellen meist mit den der Männern zusammen. 22 Fa­miliennamen haben sekundäre Suffixe (von Mädchen und Frauen). Mit dem Suffix -ien- sind 14 in offizielle Quellen eingetragen. Von den der Region typischen Familiennamensuffixe von unverheirate­ten Mädchen sind -aite (-ate) und -ike (8) offiziell registriert worden.Die Familiennamen von Einwohnern der KN widerspiegeln auch manche fonetischen Merkmale der Region und liefern Stoff für Untersuchungen von verschwundenen Sprachen. Zu erwähnen sind:14. Erhalten von Diphtongen mit n: Pinkis, Melwingis, Korint, Mentz u. a.15. In den ältesten Quellen gibt es viele Familiennamen mit der Endung, die in vielen Fällen nicht nur dem baltischen -ē, sondern auch -ä entspricht; jedoch kann das auch eine verallgemeiner­te Schriftform der früheren Quellen sein.16. Die Ausdehnung der kurzen Vokalen i und u: Dulles (neben Dullis), Pinkes (neben Pinkis), Kakes (neben Kakis), Kroßda, Skroßda (lett. krusda, lit. skruzdė), Laucenink, Sckarott u. a. Diese Merkmale findet man nur in früheren Quellen, später wurden dieselben Familiennamen normiert.17. Die baltischen ā und o wechseln in der geschriebenen Form derselben Familiennamen. Das widerspiegelt wahrscheinlich nicht nur die lettische Aussprache, sondern auch die Ausspra­che der Litauer in der Haffküstenregion, ā statt o: Naujaks und Naujoks, Klaws und Klows, Kawe.18. Dem litauischen und lettischen sich nicht in der Endung befindenden kurzen a entspricht manchmal das e: Redweik (lit. Radveikis), Wabbel (lit. Vabalas), Wanneck (lit. Vanagas, lett. Vanags).19. Der baltische Diphtong ei wird e (ē) geschrieben; das kann nicht nur o < uo des Westschemaitischen, sondern es können auch Fälle der kurischen Verwandlung ei zu ē (reiz / rėz) sein: Dewis (< deiv- oder diev-, vgl. Deivelaitis), Rezgis (< rezg- oder reizg-, vgl. Reizgys), Streģis (< strēg- oder streig-, vgl. Streigys).20. Palatalisierte Konsonanten g und k werden von den Kursenieki in vielen Fällen als ģ und ķ ausgesprochen: Pinkis, Spruogis, Zuiķis, Kakis, Gibbe, Kikala. Solche Familiennamen wer­den im Lettischen etymologisiert und haben Entsprechungen in den westlichen Dialekten des Lettischen. Das läßt vermuten, dass k’ und g’ im Kurischen bis c und dz nicht immer palatalisiert wurden.Größere Bildungsverschiedenheiten und bedeutendere regionale fonetische Unterschiede gibt es in den ältesten Quellen. In den späteren Quellen vermindert sich die Zahl der Suffixe, Endungsbildung verschwindet fast. Das kann nicht ausschließlich mit Verminderung der Einwohnerzahl erklärt wer­den. Das ist vermutlich durch innere sprachliche Prozesse und Richtungen der Einwohnermigration bedingt (die Aussiedlung aus Kurland endet und die Zahl der Einwohner der litauischen und deutschen Herkunft wächst).",1,0

"This laboratory-based study of second- and third-year American university students learning French examines the effectiveness of implicit and explicit corrective feedback on noun–adjective agreement errors. The treatment consisted of one hour of interactive tasks. Implicit feedback was operationalized as a single recast with interrogative intonation; explicit feedback was operationalized as a single repetition of the incorrect utterance with interrogative intonation, followed by a single recast with declarative intonation. Testing instruments were administered on three occasions. They comprised a spontaneous production test, an elicited imitation test, and an untimed written grammaticality judgement test. Results showed no significant differences for type of feedback but significant effects for oral interaction.",1,0

"The relationship between hearing aid benefit measured in a clinical setting and hearing aid performance in daily listening situations is not clearly established. A significant aspect of realistic listening situations is the variety of talkers that people normally encounter. This is a daily listening obstacle that is not easily recreated in a clinical setting; however, with the appropriate speech testing material the results could contribute to a better understanding of the benefit of amplification in realistic listening situations. Our present study investigated the interaction between talker variability and amplification benefit. Nine experienced hearing aid wearers with moderate to severe hearing loss were tested in aided and unaided conditions with the original and a multi-talker version of the WAKO word recognition test. Word recognition scores and response times were simultaneously measured for each test condition and test version. Variability of the test material was quantified in terms of the fundamental frequency and duration of each test word. The statistical analysis used a logistic mixed effect regression model on the word recognition scores and a linear mixed effect regression model on the response times. Introducing talker variability in the test material led to a significant decrease in amplification benefit for word recognition accuracy. These results suggest that using speech materials closer to that experienced in daily life might change the magnitude of measured benefit from hearing aids amplification.",1,0

"LEXICOGRAPHERS AS CLOSET AUTHORITARIANS ROBERT W. WADSWORTH In his 1871 book Words and Their Uses Richard Grant White republished his essay of 1869: ""A Desultory Denunciation of English Dictionaries."" In it he condemned every one of the popular dictionaries of his day for ""wearisome superfluity "" and ""puerile iteration"" (366): ""In their labor-saving, thought-lulling convenience, as in their serious faults, their many and grave deficiencies, and their needless, inconvenient, and costly cumbrousness, they are alike"" (384). White, as Mencken observes, was a man of tremendous learning. His essay sparkles with wit and contains a great deal of sense. His design for a good dictionary suggests the Concise Oxford of our own day. But his world was very different from ours. And he shows no awareness of the special needs of a large clientele dependent upon dictionaries for its livelihood: printers, proofreaders, editors, and, in our own day, typists—not to mention manufacturers of ""spell-check"" typewriters—all those called upon to ""decide, or at least act as if a decision had been made, in cases where scholars are still debating"" (Chicago Manual of Style v). White died before the Century, the International, and the Standard appeared as fresh affronts to his ideals. Meanwhile, as the master printer Theodore Low De Vinne writes in his book Correct Composition, other changes were taking place: During the last fifty years there has been no marked improvement in the average writer's preparation 81 82Robert W. Wadsworth of copy for the printer, but there have been steadily increasing exactions from book-buyers. The printing that passed a tolerant inspection in 1850 does not pass now. The reader insists on more uniformity in mechanical details, (viii) Pomting out that not one printing house in a hundred had more than one dictionary, De Vinne provided a tabulation of the spelling preferences of seven dictionaries (four American, three British). In 1948 a similar tabulation for four dictionaries was included in an American manual for editors (Skillin et al.), but in a later edition the tabulation was dropped. All that was needed was ""the dictionary""—obligingly identified in one guide in 1954 as ""the most recent edition of Webster's New International Dictionary . . . standard in the United States"" (Harvard 40).? Style manuals of individual publishers show a corresponding evolution. In 1921 the Atlantic Monthly Press published a two-page list of house departures from Merriam-Webster spellings. 2 A selection appears below: Calibre, Centre, Fibre, Manœuvre, Spectre Cyclopaedia, Diarrhoea, Orthopaedic Gramme, Kilogramme, Programme Mould, Smoulder Plough Practise (v.), Practised, Practising Quartette, Quintette, Sextette Not one of the exceptions listed here is visible in the Atlantic we read today. As late as 1949 the University of Chicago Press clung to forms of its own, perhaps under the lingering influence of the Century; but the last two editions of the manual have scrapped the exceptions and referred the reader to Merriam-Webster. Lexicographers as Closet Authoritarians83 As stylebooks have shrunk, dictionaries have swollen. Lexicographers , whatever their wishes, have been burdened with as many as possible of the case decisions no one else wishes to make and record: in spellings, in the written forms of compound words, and in the division of words into syllables. Consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, and little minds need big dictionaries. Dictionaries do not only grow; as even Richard Grant White had to admit, they improve. And as they improve at the job they all try to do, they come into closer agreement, at times achieving a consensus that comes close to a party line. If some artless American writes ""I cancelled my order and rode home on the street car,"" this statement is unlikely to reach print or even typewriting without going through the hands of some compulsive equipped with a modern American dictionary, who will clean up the text to read ""I canceled my order and rode home on the streetcar."" This laundered version then stands as evidence of the popular will for the next edition of that dictionary. Authority feeds on itself. Spelling, compounding, and syllabication, even taken together , are only a small part of lexicography, which deals with spoken as well as written English, but they provide the...",1,0

"Studies using artificial language streams indicate that infants and adults can use statistics to correctly segment words. However, most studies have utilized only a single input language. Given the prevalence of bilingualism, how is multiple language input segmented? One particular problem may occur if learners combine input across languages: the statistics of particular units that overlap different languages may subsequently change and disrupt correct segmentation. Our study addresses this issue by employing artificial language streams to simulate the earliest stages of segmentation in adult L2-learners. In four experiments, participants tracked multiple sets of statistics for two artificial languages. Our results demonstrate that adult learners can track two sets of statistics simultaneously, suggesting that they form multiple representations when confronted with bilingual input. This work, along with planned infant experiments, informs a central issue in bilingualism research, namely, determining at what point listeners can form multiple representations when exposed to multiple languages.",1,0

"That English has spread in Asia is well-known, but this critical reflection, and the five contributions and book review that we hereby introduce, contribute to rectifying the relative absence in the sociology of language literature of studies approaching language ideologies and practices in specific Asian contexts from local perspectives. We are not alone; our inspections of journal archives show that scholars are increasingly responding to this relative absence in recent years. What this special issue offers is further diversity of both authors and cases, and moreover this special issue draws attention to the immutable, binary structure underlying the various globally-circulating discourses of the East and the West as part of investigating how socially constructed East-West binaries interact with language ideologies about English and other languages. It shifts the attention from fixity – East versus West – to diversity, extending East to Easts and West to Wests as our contributors identify and examine multiple, endogenous “imaginative geograph[ies]” (from Arif Dirlik’s [1996] “Chinese history and the question of Orientalism”, History and Theory 35(4): 97) constructed through various Orientalist ideologies. It founds this approach on a combination of the theory of recursive language ideologies and critical Orientalism scholarship. This is generative of new and useful sociolinguistic analyses. Having laid out this theoretical extension, this editorial then provides an overview of the issue’s contributions, which examine how socially constructed East-West binaries are interacting with language ideologies about English and other languages on sub-national scales in various Asian contexts including in Korea, China, Japan, Tajikistan and Pakistan.",1,0

The concept of Fuzzy Logic (FL) has gained momentum in areas of artificial intelligence and allied researches because of its absolute ability to present efficient solutions to real life problems. Contrary to the paradigmatic approach to the solutions of being either absolutely true or false [0 or 1] the fuzzy sets provide a range of possible outputs with error prone inputs which are vague and inaccurate using linguistic objects instead of mere mathematical numbers. A multilingual situation poses a similar challenge for a language teacher/learner where languages exist in continuum. Learners with heavy mother tongue influence tend to use their natural languages instinctively in a way that can create their own fuzzy rules to encounter the situation of being taught an entirely new language. A typical Indian language classroom is highly multilingual where scope of errors is numerous though they are ignored. This leads to stress both for the teachers as well as the learners making the classroom ambience more mechanistic than human. To combat such situations FL based Three-Phase Model of language teaching has been proposed which derives its basis on the presumption that the language instructor is aware of general rules of linguistics. An empirical longitudinal study on 150 undergraduate technical students designed on the proposed framework has been conducted to establish the efficiency and the success of the model. Observing language pedagogy through the lens of fuzzy logic and fuzzy thinking will not only make the classroom more real-like but it will also tap the pre-existing linguistic knowledge of the learners. Language interference will be more of a resource than a challenge.,1,0

"The current study examined how the composition of intergroup contexts affects intergroup communication. We propose that when multiple outgroups exist, an extreme faction can make more moderate factions appear reasonable, creating pathways for influence. We also considered the role that an influence target’s fit with their ingroup (self-prototypicality) plays in responses to outgroup influence attempts. Specifically, we propose, and the current study showed, that both the composition of intergroup context and one’s relationship with their own group can create a pathway toward convergence of opinions and willingness to accept an outgroup’s opinion position. Two experiments (American partisans, N = 249), suggest that self-prototypicality in one’s political party positively predicts agreement with an opposing party’s message when the message appears in the presence of a more extreme outgroup than the moderate outgroup alone. This study stresses the importance of considering intragroup and intergroup comparative processes for intergroup communication research.",1,0

"Abstract Using eye tracking, this study examined L2 learners’ real-time processing of novel compounds across repeated exposures during reading. Sixty-one L2 speakers of Chinese read 12 stories over two days. Unbeknown to them, 12 novel compounds were embedded, each occurring six times. Growth curve analyses showed that semantic transparency, working memory capacity, and morphological awareness had no impact on fixation durations for the novel compounds. However, participants with a larger L2 vocabulary size processed novel opaque compounds significantly faster than those with a smaller L2 vocabulary size. For both transparent and opaque compounds, first fixation durations did not change across exposures, yet similar curvilinear decreasing patterns were found in gaze duration and total reading time, with the rates of decrease moderated by L2 vocabulary size and working memory capacity, respectively. Taken together, such findings provide converging evidence supporting the incidental nature of vocabulary learning through natural reading.",1,0

"Understanding and learning from academic texts involves purposeful, strategic reading. Adolescent readers, particularly poor readers, benefit from explicit instruction in text comprehension strategies, such as text preview, summarization, and comprehension monitoring, as part of a comprehensive reading program. However, strategies are difficult to teach within subject area lessons where content instruction must take primacy. Speech-language pathologists (SLPs) have the expertise and service delivery options to support middle and high school students in learning to use comprehension strategies in their academic reading and learning. This article presents the research evidence on what strategies to teach and how best to teach them, including the use of explicit instruction, spoken interactions around text, cognitive modeling, peer learning, classroom connections, and disciplinary literacy. The article focuses on how to move comprehension strategies from being teaching tools of the SLP to becoming learning tools of the student. SLPs can provide the instruction and support needed for students to learn and apply of this important component of academic reading.",1,0

"Chinese, Japanese and Arabic bilingual dictionaries suffer from shortcomings rarely seen in works of other major languages. These include archaic headwords and senses, inappropriate examples, an overly prescriptive approach, learner-unfriendly sense ordering, and the omission of important multiword expressions, among others. This paper describes how three bilingual learners’ dictionaries address these problems, focusing on compilation and design innovations that increase learner usability, and compares them with other dictionaries that do not meet these goals adequately. Specific issues to be addressed include sense ordering, the logical interrelatedness of senses, the semantic transparency and morphological productivity of Chinese characters, lexical categories, headword selection criteria, and the treatment of multiword expressions.",1,0

"As speech-language pathologists (SLPs) working with children and youth are challenged to assume new or expanded roles with reading and writing, those SLPs practicing in the schools face specific barriers for doing so. These obstacles take two forms: individual inhibitors, involving specific people, and system inhibitors, involving the organization at various levels. To overcome these barriers, SLPs need to be proactive and take charge of their own destinies by engaging in specific actions to assume these new or expanded literacy roles. They need to make it happen by using specific tools at their disposal to influence others. These tools include marketing, effective communication, and negotiation.",1,0

"The goal of this paper is three-fold. First, adopting Chomsky's (2013, 2015) Merge-α model of syntactic derivation, I advance the hypothesis that composite probing (Coon & Bale 2014; van Urk 2015) is made available in English and Chinese to derive locative inversion via external set-Merge of C and T, forming {C, T} (see also Saito 2012 and Epstein et al. 2016). Second, I argue that English {C, T} hosts a non-selective Ā-probe, whereas the Chinese counterpart a relativized one. Importantly, I propose that this crosslinguistic contrast in the non-selective/relativized nature of a composite probe is deducible from the articulated structure in the left periphery and external set-Merge of heads. Third, what is crucial for the Merge-α model is the set of independent principles that regulate the generative capacity of free Merge by examining its varied outputs. I contend that the need of Case valuation on DPs, the activity of the φ-probe, and the Intervention Constraint all play crucial roles in English to exclude some structures built based on the introduction of {C, T} and its composite probe. Couched in the Merge-α framework, this paper suggests a new way to restrictively model the variation in A/Ā properties of movement across languages and across individual constructions language-internally. The proposed approach derives the relevant variation without stipulating construction-specific mechanisms or a variation in the nature of probes — the variation comes from the C-heads that merge with T prior to probing and how it interacts with independent syntactic principles.",1,0

"Politics, English, and the Hungarian-English Dictionary: The Work of László Országh JohnJablonski From late 1984 to 1987, I was fortunate enough to work as the Cultural Affairs Officer at the United States Embassy in Budapest, Hungary, during a fascinating time in its history. Life in Eastern Europe, especially in Hungary, was improving: exchanges of people and ideas were developing rapidly, western books and media were well represented. It was almost as if communism had died earlier than 1989, though there were still restrictions on intellectual freedom. For example, party members seemed to receive scholarships to study abroad more easily than non-party members, and, even though it was perfectly legal to subscribe to National Geographic, the September 1980 issue that discussed Afghanistan and its Soviet occupation in the early 1980s mysteriously was not delivered. As part of my training before going to post, I learned Hungarian and bought two volumes of the four-volume Hungarian-English dictionary . The name on the cover was Országh, and I paid no particular attention to it. After all, I did not seek to learn anything about Cassell or Langenscheidt when I was studying German. Besides Országh without the h means 'country'. When I arrived in Budapest, in late 1984, 1 had no idea that die dictionary's author had died in January of die same year, that I had entered Hungary as though landing in London in 1785, after the deatii of Dr. Johnson. Fortunately, my work brought me into contact with László Országh's former students: the country was, and still is, teeming with Boswells. I first learned about Országh as a lexicographer from Myron Simon, who in 1984-85 was a Fulbright LecDictionaries :Journal oftheDictionary Society ofNorth America 24 (2003) 228John Jablonski turer at Országh's university in Debrecen and who first referred (at least to me) to Országh ""the Dr. Johnson of Hungary."" Until this time, I had no idea that there was a link between the dictionary and the man. When I met Országh's former students, I was impressed by die reverence that they showed toward their teacher, everybody referring to him as Professor Országh, despite the fact, as I learned much later, that he helped students financially and even sent hand-written letters of good wishes to former students on die occasion tiieir marriages or die birtiis of children. As my time in Hungary drew on, I picked up anecdotes of Országh and have tried to piece together an American's reminiscence of a great lexicographer whom I never met. My work took me to what was then the Kossuth Lajos University in Debrecen, a city on the eastern border close to Romania, on the verge of Transylvania. My ""contacts"" all worked in die Department of English, of which Országh had been head until his retirement in 1969. A large picture of him hung in what used to be his office: even after his death, he was a presence. His students are among the finest teachers and scholars of English and American studies in Hungary, and all speak glowingly of their teacher. I wondered what it was like to be a scholar during the ""bad old days,"" when students of western topics were, at the very least, discouraged, when travel to English-speaking countries was all but impossible for students, and when books in English were difficult to get, eitiier because tiiey were too expensive or were confiscated. Országh stands out as a singular figure in Hungary: he was a scholar and teacher in an officially unpopular discipline, a world-renowned lexicographer , and he represented the politics under which Hungarians had to work in order to claim the right to participate in the intellectual currents that had occupied them for over 1,000 years. László Országh was born in Szombathely, a city on the western border, in October 1907, and studied both English and German at the Pázmány Péter University in Budapest. Students of English at the time were encouraged to study in England, since it was relatively close, and ties between the two countries were strong. Orsz...",1,0

"A partir do rigoroso trabalho de análise filológica de testemunhos medievais de Angel D’Ors em torno à identidade de Pedro Hispano, autor do célebre manual de lógica medieval Tractatus, famoso devido à menção no Paraíso da Divina Comédia, este artigo propõe uma revisão tanto da crítica literária do poema como da identificação generalizada do personagem com o papa português João XXI —supostamente o único papa colocado por Dante no Paraíso—. Com base no próprio texto do Tractatus, na Divina Comédia e seus antigos comentaristas e nos testemunhos anteriores ao poema, argumentaremos em favor da identificação deste personagem com Pedro Afonso, filho bastardo do rei Afonso II de Portugal, que, por sua vez, poderia ser identificado com o frade dominicano Petrus Alfonsi Hispanus.

"So Many Stories: A Tribute to Professor Ladislav S.L. Zgusta i: Donna M. T. Cr. Farina1 NewJersey City University ""t is fitting that this tribute to Professor Ladislav S.L. Zgusta .should be published in Dictionaries:Journal oftheDictionary Society ofNorth America. Professor Zgusta was a frequent contributor of articles and reviews to Dictionaries, and was a founding member, vicepresident (1981-1983), and president (1983-1985) of the Dictionary Society, an organization that was important to him. His scholarly work in lexicography and many other fields will continue to shape and influence us. The passing of Professor Zgusta on April 27, 2007 prompted so many conversations and exchanges of emails, the renewal of old friendships and acquaintanceships, and the formation of new ones. It also resulted in the intense telling of stories — the remembrance of events that would have been inconsequential and long forgotten if Professor Zgusta had not been present. However, this storytelling was not new — it had begun for most of us soon after we first met Professor Zgusta, and it continued every time we saw him or each other. While Professor Zgusta awed us with intelligence and scholarly accomplishment that seemed humanly impossible, he was loved and respected — and will be remembered — because of his human qualities. Professor Zgusta made time for everyone — he focused on each person he interacted with: to tell ajoke; 1I would like to diank all die contributors.

He even told us amazing stories of his own life. Each person who received his attention felt important and honored. While our memories are vivid, many of the stories have been told and retold until there is the aura of legend around some of them. This legendary quality certainly befits a phenomenon such as Professor Zgusta, but I believe it would also have amused him. In response, he might have laughed his unique and contagious laugh, pronounced the appropriate Latin proverb, frowned with disapproval or shook his finger if someone dared to ask for a translation, provided the translation after all, enjoyed others' amusement, and queried: ""Isn't it so?"" This tribute begins with an essay by Hans Henrich Hock, Professor Zgusta's colleague at the University of Illinois. Hock enumerates Professor Zgusta's scholarly achievements and provides glimpses of some of the amazing events of his colorful life. The tribute continues with memories written by friends, colleagues, and students who knew him.

"The Middle English Dictionary at 71 Hi Robert E. Lewis ""ardly anyone — if, indeed, anyone at all — ever sets out in .life to become a lexicographer. It almost always comes about by happenstance. One need only think of some of the best known figures in English-language lexicography: Samuel Johnson, Charles Richardson, Noah Webster, the men who started the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) (Herbert Coleridge and Frederick Furnivall), and then the chief editors (James Murray, Henry Bradley, W A. Craigie, and C. T Onions), or William Dwight Whitney, the editor of The Century Dictionary. And so it has been with the Middle English Dictionary (MED).1 Samuel Moore, a professor of English, was recruited from his academic post in 1930 to become the first editor. Hans Kurath had no lexicographical experience when he arrived at Michigan in 1946 to become the third (and to make matters worse, as his detractors pointed out, he was not even a medievalist). Sherman Kuhn, who followed Kurath as editor in 1961, also had none, but he did have the advantage of a good long apprenticeship under Kurath, beginning in 1948. A few others did have some lexicographical experience before coming to the MED. Thomas Knott, who followed Moore in 1935, had been General Editor of the second edition of Webster's New International Dictionary of the English Language and had learned his lexicography on the job at Merriam-Webster, in Springfield, Massachusetts; Hereward Price, who 1In what follows, the abbreviation MED stands for both the published dictionary and the dictionary project that began at die University of Michigan in 1930. Readers will easily be able to tell which one is meant from the context. Dictionaries:Journal ofthe Dictionary Society ofNorth America 23 (2002) The Middle English Dictionary at 7177 was in charge between Knott's illness, and subsequent death, and the arrival of Kurath, was an assistant to Murray on the OED, the editor of a bilingual dictionary of economic terms (1926-29), and on the staff of the Early Modern English Dictionary before he shifted to the MED staff in 1940; and William Hale, who joined the MED staff as an assistant editor the same year I came, had been an associate editor and etymologist at Merriam-Webster working on the ninth edition of Webster's New CollegiateDictionary. When I arrived in August of 1982, I expected to be trained by Sherman Kuhn, as he had been by Kurath, but he was spending most of his time trying to catch up with the reviewing, and, moreover, he became ill in November of that year and for all practical purposes was out of the office until the following March; he retired soon after. My training consisted of sitting in on the formal sessions that Mary Jane Williams was conducting for the three new editors who arrived that fall, leading biweekly staff seminars at which we took up various editorial problems, and, of course, learning both on my own and from my colleagues on the staff. My first reviewing was done, half a year later, with Helen Kao, and I know I learned more about editing from her during those sessions than she learned about reviewing from me. This is what I like to call bootstrap lexicography at its most extreme. From 1982 to 1991, however, we did try hard to provide a good training program for the twenty-one new editors who came to the MED during that time, usually with formal sessions conducted by Williams, reinforced and supplemented by a mentoring system involving the experienced editors, but the fact remains that lexicography is usually and primarily self-taught, and we seem somehow to have managed over the years, as other historical dictionaries have done, and, in the process, to have created what a National Endowment for the Humanities reviewer has called, and what we like to think of as, ""one of the major research contributions to English language, literature, and culture.""2 The MED in its present form is based on a plan devised by Kurath in 1946. That plan had three main components and was based on what Kurath believed could be done well. First, there was to be a full display...",1,0

"PHONOLOGISCHE ANMERKUNGEN ZU DEN NORDÖSTLICHEN „VILNAER“ MUNDARTEN Zusammenfassung Die Aufmerksamkeit des Aufsatzes richtet sich auf eine bislang von Dialektologen nicht gebührend bewertete Eigenart des Vokalquantität in den nordöstlichen Mundarten des „Vilnaer“ Gebiets. Daten von Mundarten aus dem Bezirk von Ignalina entsprechen nicht einer im Atlas des Litauischen bestim­mten Tendenz, wonach die Mehrzahl der Mundarten des Vilnaer Gebiets sich durch ein Zweilängen-Vokalsystem auszeichne, in welchem lange und kurze Vokale sich unabhängig von ihrer Position er­mitteln lassen. Unter Berufung auf vorhandenes Material kann man behaupten, daß ein reines System aus zwei Vokallängen den nordöstlichen Mundarten des Vilnaer Gebiets nicht eigen ist. Dieses gesam­te Gebiet spaltet sich in zwei Teile auf: in einen südlichen, für das ein System aus zwei Vokallängen typisch ist, und einen nordöstlichen Teil, in dem ein System aus drei Vokallängen vorherrscht. Diesen Teil machen die Gemeinden von Palūšė, Ceikiniai, Paringys, Mielagėnai, Daugėliškis, Kazitiškis, Rimšė und Dūkštas aus.",1,0

"A BAsI CONSTRUCTION one must master to read German expository prose is EXTENDED MODIFIER or EXTENDED ADJECTIVAL construction. One soon learns that German morphology, phonology, and particularly syntax have a way of being remarkably concise, if not downright blunt. The extended modifier saves verbiage of a relative clause and avoids trailing effect of modifiers that follow noun by tucking all punch up front between article and noun, as in this example: ein anfangsfiirjeden Studenten ziemlich schwieriges Problem. Word-for-word phrase translates as 'an initially for every student rather difficult problem,' or, restructured into more idiomatic English syntax, 'a problem that is initially rather difficult for every student.' The word-for-word translation sounds strange in English. Follett's Modern American Usage censures any such English structures, classifying them indiscriminately as Germanisms and rejecting them as deeply at variance with genius of [English] an agglutination of ideas into complex phrases ... against normal articulation of thought and an insult to reason. For him, the language has no need of such fallacious compressions, which corrupt both style and thought. 1 Anyone at home in both Germanic languages is made doubly uncomfortable by Follett's abrupt dismissal. Not only has construction been accepted and utilized for decades in one Germanic language, German, but in recent years it has been gradually working its way into another, English. No dosage of grammatical prescription will be sufficient to cure spread of American extended modifier, because reasons for its popularity and growth are much same as those for its original use in German: economy and impact. Journalists, sponsors, commentators, advertisers, entertainers, gossip columnists, and editors alike are utilizing it to deliver most message with fewest words. What once might have been esthetically odd or ugly is now functionally striking and attractive. After all, medium is message.",1,0

本文讨论汉语进行貌标记「在」及持续貌标记「着」的语意差异，及从语意差异而来的、对时序关系的影响。本文提出，进行貌「在」为标示一个事件在某个时间点上进行，而持续貌「着」则描述一个同质的事件或状态持续了一段时间。未完成悖论预测了「在」所标示的事件并抵达其自然终点，因此，由「在」所呈献的事件的叙述时间不能被推进。「着」所描述的事件或状态必需为同质的，没有自然终点可以抵达，故与未完成悖论无关。虽然「着」所描述的事件或状态没有自然终点可以抵达，但是，可以持续一段时间而在这一段时间中可以有另一个事件抵达其自然终点。因此，只要「着」所描述的事件或状态持续够久，能让另一事件抵达其自然终点，则「着」所描述的事件或状态的叙述时间则可推进。此外，本文亦提出，在没有其它讯息相抵触的情况下，「在」和「着」所描述的事件或状态提供了一个预设的时间背景，同一篇章中的其它事件或状态则发生、持续于此一时间背景之中。,1,0

In a city where speculation fuels the money markets, second guessing about corporate futures is commonplace throughout the business community.

"• The Difference-in-Distance metric is problematic because it is biased. • Difference-in-Distance is biased to find that greater starting distance gives rise to greater convergence. • The starting distance effect is an artefact of how Difference-in-Distance works. • Linear combination is a feasible alternative method of measuring imitation. Phonetic imitation elicited in studies where participants shadow model talkers is often quantified using the Difference-in-Distance (DID) metric, while a less commonly used method is linear combination. This study tests these two approaches for evidence of the Starting Distance Bias, where participants who are more distinct from the model talkers at baseline will be found to converge more than those with smaller starting distances. The two approaches are each applied to three datasets, one in which convergence was possible, an altered version in which it was not, and a control group in which no change at all is present. DID finds that greater starting distance gives rise to greater convergence in all cases, even in the datasets that lack convergence, suggesting that the starting distance effect is a bias, rather than a genuine behaviour of the participants. In contrast, linear combination found no such effect in any dataset. Graphical analysis illustrates that the Starting Distance Bias is introduced by DID because the range of possible DID values is restricted as a function of starting distance, whereas no such restriction applies in linear combination. This study suggests that future investigations of imitation should avoid using DID, especially when starting distance is likely to vary.",1,0

"ARE YOU A NAME OR A NUMBER1 This presentation attempts to answer the question and to explore the traditional role of names identifying places, things, and persons. Name origins, grouping problems, and transliteration are considered; a short description of the Board on Geographic Names is given; non-personal names are covered briefly. Major emphasis is placed, however, on personal names: types, structure, methods of handling large volumes, and recent automation activity in this field. Let us ask ourselves, In a symbolic sense, are we today a name or a number Ifwe could gaze into a crystal ball and seehowmany times each of us is being referred to in some transaction or other a charge account posting, an income tax return audit, the recording of a deed, the posting of a personal check in a bank, a social security retirement entry and so on I think first we would be amazed at the large number of transactions, undoubtedly dozens and perhaps hundreds of times each day for each of us. Thus we are speaking of billions of data transformation actions each day. Moreover, it is my estimate that the majority of these transactions referring to us use a number, not our names as the key, for there has been a strong trend in this direction in recent years. Why is this so ~It is mainly because numbers can with ease and fewer characters be discretely assigned to each person, and thus are easier to vorkwith than names, both manually and by machine methods. Extrapolating this trend, can we then conclude that it is only a matter of time before we all truly become a mere number in our symbolic world 1 There are those who would so conjecture. It is suggested that we have our social security number tattooed on our bodies at birth, put on our license plates, be our bank account number, employee number, etc., all in the name of efficiency. Have you noticed an increased use of your Social Security number lately 1Many of us have. * Presented at the Fourth Names Institute held May 1, 1965, at Fairleigh Dickinson University, Madison, N.

"The voice system of Tagalog has been proposed to be symmetrical in the sense that there are no morphologically unmarked voice forms. This stands in contrast to asymmetrical voice systems, which exhibit unmarked and marked voices (e.g. active and passive in German). This article investigates the psycholinguistic processing consequences of the potential (a)symmetries in the voice systems of Tagalog and German by analyzing changes in cognitive load during sentence production. Tagalog and German native speakers’ pupil diameters were recorded while they produced sentences with different voice markings. Growth-curve analyses of the shape of task-evoked pupillary responses revealed that processing-load changes were similar for different voices in the symmetrical voice system of Tagalog. By contrast, actives and passives in the asymmetrical voice system of German exhibited different patterns of processing-load changes during sentence production. This is interpreted as supporting the notion of (relative) symmetry in the Tagalog voice system. Mental effort during sentence planning changes in different ways in the two languages because the grammatical architecture of their voice systems is different. Additionally, an anti-Patient bias in sentence production was found: linking patients to the subject function seems to be associated with greater cognitive effort. This anti-Patient bias in production adds converging evidence to ‘subject preferences’ reported in the sentence-comprehension literature.",1,0
"One of the principles of grammar introduced in Chomsky (1981) is the Empty Category Principle, which can be stated as follows: (i) [α e] must be properly governed. Proper government, as defined by Chomsky, is of two types (see footnote 2). First, there is proper government by a lexical category of the [±N±V] type. In (2a), for example, the empty category (e i ) is properly governed by the verb see , a lexical element of the [-N+V] type. Second, there is proper government by coindexation. In (2b), for example, the empty category in subject position (e i ) is properly governed by the coindexed trace in COMP (t i ).",1,0

"The Treatment of Parts of Speech in Dictionaries of Lexicography. The aim of the article is to present and analyse how three dictionaries of lexicography, i.e. Lexicog­raphy.

Hartmann and Gregory James and Wörterbuch zur Lexikographie und Wörterbuch­forschung/Dictionary of Lexicography and Dictionary Research (2010–2020) by Herbert Ernst Wiegand et al., treat parts of speech.

Then, the interconnectedness of the articles on parts of speech and other lexicographic content is scrutinised. Subsequently, entries with lexicography-related infor­mation are examined qualitatively. The article concludes with some general remarks on the description of lexicography-external terms in dictionaries of lexicography. The author postulates that both the part-of-speech articles and all other entries on terms from outside lexicography, e.g. from the field of linguistics, contain lexicographic information. It is not the function of these articles to replace analogous articles from specialised dictionaries on the disciplines concerned, and to offer the same content.

"“The Drinkers Dictionary,” a list of 229 expressions describing someone who is inebriated, is commonly attributed to Benjamin Franklin; a Pennsylvania Gazette article of January 13, 1737 (1736 Old Style), is credited as its first publication. There is, however, an earlier publication of a very similar word list in the New England Weekly Journal of July 6, 1736. The two word lists are largely identical; however, differences in the lists and the accompanying essays indicate that “The Drinkers Dictionary” originated in Boston and suggest that Franklin's 1722 Silence Dogood essay in the New-England Courant was not the primary genesis for either word list. Thus, Franklin was not the earliest publisher and most likely not the principal compiler of the word list. Possible New England authors of the NEWJ essay and its dictionary are Mather Byles, Joseph Green, and John Colman.",1,0

"Articulatory parameters are determined from the first five formant frequencies and the first three formant amplitudes by the minimization of the root mean square error in the acoustic space. Beforehand, the nonlinear properties of the articulatory-to-acoustic transformation are investigated by use of a parametric representation of the area function and an electric analogue of the lossy vocal tract. A global analysis of the transformation is performed to locate the excessive nonlinearities that induce errors during the minimization procedure. A table of reference articulatory-acoustic pairs is generated from that analysis. The articulatory parameter identification procedure consists of an initial guess obtained from the reference table and a least-squares algorithm. Tests on formant values produced by the model itself indicate the efficiency of the method in solving the inverse problem. Another test on formant values corresponding to Fant's area function data provides qualitatively acceptable results, but the lack in precision indicates the limitations of the actual articulatory model.",1,0

"A set of simple new procedures has been developed to enable the real-time manipulation of speech parameters. The proposed method uses pitch-adaptive spectral analysis combined with a surface reconstruction method in the time–frequency region. The method also consists of a fundamental frequency (F0) extraction using instantaneous frequency calculation based on a new concept called `fundamentalness'. The proposed procedures preserve the details of time–frequency surfaces while almost perfectly removing fine structures due to signal periodicity. This close-to-perfect elimination of interferences and smooth F0 trajectory allow for over 600% manipulation of such speech parameters as pitch, vocal tract length, and speaking rate, while maintaining high reproductive quality.",1,0

"In this article, we will examine some contrasted discourses on multilingualism that circulate nowadays in the field of education. Focusing on the cases of French-speaking Belgium and of the Franco-Ontarian community in Canada, we will show the existence of two discourses on multilingualism: one that insists on the positive value of multilingualism and that we consider as a consequence of social and economic changes brought by globalisation; and another that is much more a surrender of the purist conception of language rejecting ‘mixing’ and hybridism and that seems to support resistance towards unwanted consequences of this globalisation movements (especially migration movements). In our view, these discourses on multilingualism are ideological discourses aiming at legitimating or contesting the impacts of global capitalism and post-nationalism.",1,0

"Transnational higher education (TNHE), often based on export models of Western-based universities and driven by neoliberal market economy agendas, has spread across the globe. One example of TNHE is Qatar’s Education City where six prestigious American international branch campuses (IBCs) all administer their degrees through English medium instruction (EMI). While there is a burgeoning amount of research investigating and problematizing issues in EMI higher education institutions, IBCs are a unique EMI setting due to their heavy reliance on importing faculty, staff, curricula and practices from their home campuses. Thus, this study takes an ethnographic case study approach to examine the language planning and policy and linguistic landscape at one IBC in Qatar. Drawing on multiple sources of data, the study reveals both the overt and covert language policies and ideologies of the institution and its various stakeholders, and the extent to which languages other than English are used and accepted.",1,0

"In his recent bid for the presidency of the Association for Mathematics of Language, Makoto Kanazawa writes:* The scientific study of language is such a large and important field that it's strange that so little mathematical research is being carried out. By comparison, the latest issue of Journal of Economic Theory has 14 original articles, and all but one of them are mathematical papers in the sense of containing theorems and proofs. And the title of the journal is not ‘ Journal of Mathematical Economics ’, which is actually a separate journal. 1 That linguistics lags behind economics is not surprising: making more money is a stronger drive for change and progress than better understanding the language faculty. But Bruce Tesar's book shows that the time might be ripe for change and progress in our field as well. Employing a formally sophisticated analytical approach (as opposed to a purely simulation-based approach), the book provides a beautiful example of the interplay between learnability and structural assumptions on the typological space. It thus shows that computational phonology has become a mature subfield of generative linguistics.",1,0

"In this paper we examine how physical and verbal actions are constituted as morally accountable within an institutional context. Through the detailed examination of a video recording of the aftermath of an on-court altercation between players in a basketball training session, we explore how the members work to establish a locally organized institutional context for an action within which in situ moral reasoning practices are then brought to bear to make sense of the players’ actions and render them as morally accountable or not. In examining the moral organization of institutional accountability in an instance of basketball training activity, the paper develops a further level of detail to understand the reflexive organization of membership categories and the institutional moral order.",1,0

"The arrival of Protestantism in mid-sixteenth century France prompted the redefinition of an emerging national identity hitherto built around the twin concepts of inherent national Catholicism and monarchical legitimacy. In the popular writing of the day, poets deliberately used overtly nationalistic languages of weaponry, fidelity and treason to define religious groups. This article traces the evolution of languages of loyalty, treason and war in the exchange of polemical poems between Pierre de Ronsard and his protestant critics and discusses their efficiency in establishing enduring tropes which outlived the sixteenth century. It argues that Catholic and Protestant poets subverted the medieval image of France as the “most Christian” nation to achieve the vilification of their religious opponents, establishing a religious core to national identity which sustained French life up to and beyond the Revolution. It then considers the reflection of civil unrest in the use of languages of war and weaponry. Enabling men who were not soldiers to “fight” away from the battlefield, it also saw poets engaging in single combat in the defence of their faith, consciously referring to the codified rules of the duel.",1,0

Some emphasis is put on the role of extremal axioms in the characterization of such models. The notion of the intended model seems to be of some interest for linguists, too. This is one of the reasons for which this paper is published in a linguistic journal.",1,0

"There has been much discussion of the proliferation of racialized narratives both offline and online and its role in the current electoral successes of far-right movements across the globe. We extend this conversation by analyzing narrative practices from two contexts where far-right parties and figures enjoy popular support: Italy and the Philippines. In both cases, we show how narratives that pivot on race constitute stancetaking practices that align with far-right agendas. In the Northern Italian case, racialized stances emerge in storytelling events, through which participants (co)construct extracomunitari , or ‘migrants from outside the European Union’, as “other” and “a danger” to the Italian nation. In the case of Filipino YouTube users, President Duterte’s supporters subvert racialized tropes through anti-imperial narratives in ways that attempt to delegitimize human rights criticisms of the drug war. We show how, in and through narrative practices, speech participants justify exclusionary and eliminationist politics in far-right contexts.",1,0

"Combining raciolinguistics and social semiotics, I explore a snapshot of socio-politically and historically contextualized multimodal digital activity in social networking site Tumblr involving American entertainer Beyoncé. I examine a set of 41 Tumblr posts, gathered in 2016 during Beyoncé’s heightened social and political salience, in which users expressed counterhegemonic stances. I first demonstrate how Tumblr users employ images and references of Beyoncé in ways that resist visual and linguistic hegemonic discourses and realize and index issues of race and gender. I show how Tumblr users resemiotize and reentextualize Beyoncé in decolonizing stances, including those that challenge White gazes, prioritize non-White subjectivity, and destabilize Whiteness. I conclude that Beyoncé’s use as a semiotic resource adds to her indexicalities as she is deployed in various stances. I assert that a raciolinguistic perspective elucidates intersectionally racialized and gendered ideological changes to Beyoncé’s multimodal indexical field and that attention to digital semiotics increases the multimodal and intersectional perspectives of raciolinguistic analyses.",1,0

"Desde sus origenes, la reflexion linguistica occidental ha estudiado el fenomeno de la elipsis. Dos han sido las perspectivas principales desde las que se ha enfocado este estudio: la gramatical y la retorica, convertida hoy dia en la orientacion pragmatico-discursiva. En la primera, la elipsis ha estado al servicio de los esquemas sintacticos abstractos propuestos por las teorias. En la segunda, yendo mas alla de las tradicionales referencias a la economia y la expresividad, la elipsis ha sido analizada en relacion con el entorno y con la cohesion textual. Transportadas las reflexiones teoricas al mundo de los fenomenos, en concreto a los discursos orales, observamos grandes dificultades en la aplicacion al coloquio del concepto de la elipsis elaborado en la orientacion gramatical.

"Partiendo de la definición del esquema enunciativo (tipo de frase) como una unidad comunicativa, se caracteriza el imperativo como una modalidad morfologizada de tipo apelativo que se utiliza cuando se dan los siguientes requisitos: sentido de apelación, 2ª persona, tiempo futuro y ausencia de negación. En español, cualquier variación en alguno de estos requisitos determina que se use el subjuntivo. Se rechaza la idea de que el imperativo sea una variante del subjuntivo especializada en la función apelativa o que ambos “modos” compartan un morfema desiderativo, porque ello significaría asignar a una categoría morfológica del verbo (el subjuntivo) una propiedad que en realidad corresponde a ciertos esquemas enunciativos. Sí se integra el imperativo y el subjuntivo en el marco de lo que llamamos “espacio desiderativo-apelativo”, donde se agrupa una serie de procedimientos gramaticales o gramaticalizados basados en el imperativo y el subjuntivo. Semánticamente, se organiza en torno a un componente de deseabilidad (la acción se presenta como deseable) que, al variar diversos factores, configura un recorrido que va desde un centro situado en el imperativo a una periferia que se encuentra en la expresión del deseo.",1,0

"In this article, we consider legal notices of various forms, including imperative, indicative, and non-sentential. We argue that these convey various illocutionary forces depending on their particular content. In particular, those that prohibit actions — unlike laws that do so — typically have “directive” illocutionary force, with different linguistic classes of legal notices achieving this force through different means, given their distinct linguistic properties. We propose a “bare phrase” treatment of non-sentential notices, whereby these are underlyingly and not just superficially non-sentential; and a semantic treatment in terms of Discourse Representation Theory, which perspicuously describes their contribution to interpretation. Finally, we argue that assigning such sparse syntactic and semantic representations to non-sentential notices has conceptual and empirical advantages over analyses that posit richer underlying structure, capturing a broader range of data, including patterns involving default case and the absence of articles, and minimizing the need to posit linguistic ambiguity.",1,0

"Un système général permettant de comparer les expressions se rapportant aux phénomènes psychologiques dans les langues d'Asie et d'Europe est présenté dans les termes du contraste Whorfien entre cryptotype et phénotype.

Plusieurs critères de classification des psycho-collocations sont suggérés en fonction par exemple du domaine sémantique, au degré de référence interpersonnelle de la structure morphosyntaxique, ou du type de métaphore employé.

"REVIEW ARTICLE Approaches to Meaning and Their Uses in Lexicography Sidney I. Landau Jerzy Tomaszczyk and Barbara Lewandowska-Tomasczcyk's Meaning and Lexicography (Amsterdam and Philadelphia, 1990) consists of a collection of invited papers presented at an international conference at the University ofLodz, 19-21 June, 1985. Robert Burchfield has written the opening remarks (unaccountably called a Preface instead of a Foreword, which name is given to an editor's note describing the conference). Burchfield's comment is followed by a detailed introduction by the editors in which each paper is usefully summarized (very usefully—more about this in a moment). The nineteen papers in the volume are grouped under four headings: 1. General Foundations and a Historical Perspective; 2. Word Formation and Syntax; 3. Semantics and Pragmatics (by far the longest); and 4. Diachrony. I will reserve my general comments for the end of this review, but it must be noted at the outset that this is not an easy book to read. A number of the papers employ diction that is alien to English and a vocabulary that only cognitive linguists know, and sprinkle the whole with copious, unnecessary, parenthetical references every few phrases. The numerous typographical errors do not help, and the editing throughout is poor. There is no indication of the affiliations of any of the contributors, nor is one given a clue as to who might be a practicing lexicographer and who a linguist or cognitive scientist or philosopher. Such information would have been helpful since no one can be equally expert in all the disciplines embraced by this volume, and one could at least begin reading each paper within a frame ofreference . The summary in the editors' introduction must therefore often be consulted to find out what the author is talking about. The sensation, in the worst cases, is that of flying through dense fog that 92Sidney I. Landau now and then lifts to reveal a glimmer of land and sea, only to evaporate again with the next onrush ofdeep obscurity. The editors' summaries thus serve as a kind of electronic beacon to put one on automatic pilot for a while until one can get one's bearings. Part 1: General Foundations and a Historical Perspective ""Metaphysics ofthe Dictionary versus the Lexicon,"" by Miroslav Nowakowski, introduces this section. The substance of the argument is that interest in the lexicon has been stimulated in the last decade (1975-85) by debate over the role of semantics in syntax and by criticism of the methodological inadequacy of current linguistic models dealing with morphology and lexical semantics. It is most unfortunate that this paper is first in the volume, because it is an impenetrable bramble ofjargon, poor command of the English idiom, and nonexistent copy-editing. Here is a sample of the writing: JackendofPs (1983) operations on conceptual structures with his powerful preference rule systems are able to take care of any type ofcomputation provided that the linguist is interested in the interpretation (understanding) of the computation's outcome only. These rules do not feed the lexicon. Thus, they are unable to distinguish, as 'real' speakers are, which operations are lexical and which, for instance, sentential in nature. (6) It would be a shame ifreaders were discouraged from reading on, because although several of the succeeding essays also share some of these characteristics, none is so consistent in applying bad English to what one suspects is an inherently difficult subject. Joanna M. ChannelPs ""Vocabulary Acquisition and the Mental Lexicon"" makes the case, on psycholinguistic grounds, for renewed emphasis on teaching vocabulary as an independent activity. The author discusses the contrasting uses of the mental lexicon in production and comprehension. In producing a word, the speaker begins with a store of meanings that must be represented as sounds; in comprehending , the listener interprets sounds in patterns that can be interpreted as having meaning. This is true of both Ll and L2 (first language and second language) users. Studies of vocabulary acquisition have focused primarily on Ll users. Knowledge of how L2 users represent the lexicon mentally is still extremely limited, but it is an intriguing question. Much of what is known about L2 users depends on the kinds...",1,0

"This article examines the relatively understudied question of how cognition and emotion (as induced by language) interact in assessment situations in higher education contexts. It does so against the backdrop of different outcomes for students with varying forms of linguistic cultural capital in South African higher education. Applying phenomenology as methodology, we unpack the ways in which students at the University of the Western Cape experience both monolingual and multilingual assessment from the standpoint of the cognition– emotion interface. The findings show that while monolingual assessment created affective barriers to cognition, a far more enabling environment was created by the provision of alternative multilingual linguistic arrangements. The article reflects on the implications of the analysis both for levelling the playing field in a context where language is a major source of inequality and for scholarship on language in assessment.",1,0

"La présente contribution prend place dans la filiation des recherches sur le rapport des individus à l’orthographe, recherches qui caractérisent la place que celle-ci occupe dans la société en général ou au sein de certaines professions, notamment chez les enseignants et corrélativement chez les élèves. Ces travaux montrent que pour tout un chacun, l’orthographe revêt des enjeux personnels et sociaux forts. Nous proposons de compléter ces recherches en abordant l’orthographe comme une norme sociale culturelle à travers les significations que les enseignants de l’école primaire construisent à propos de graphies fantaisistes qui détournent l’orthographe normée, appelées figures rhéto-orthographiques. Nous postulons que celles-ci mettent à l’épreuve le rapport qu’ils ont construit à la norme sociale orthographique et ce, de façon variable entre eux, selon les déformations graphiques proposées, mais aussi selon qu’ils s’expriment à titre personnel ou à titre professionnel. Des entretiens semi-directifs menés auprès de trente maitres de cycle 3 nous permettent de répondre à cette question.",1,0

"L'A. analyse dans cet article les differentes interpretations semantiques du verbe francais 'monter' et de ses equivalents en bulgare. Apres avoir dans un premier temps tente d'identifier l'invariant semantique dans la polysemie du verbe francais, l'A. compare 'monter' a ses correspondants bulgares. Il observe d'une part que ces deux langues appartiennent au meme type linguistique, a l'exception du systeme de prefixes du bulgare, specifique aux langues slaves. D'autre part, il souligne que les polysemies ne sont toutefois pas identiques de langue a langue. Si l'etablissement de schemes de representations cognitives permet une confrontation precise de deux systemes linguistiques ayant chacun son organisation polysemique particuliere, cela n'implique pas pour autant l'existence d'un systeme cognitif unique.",1,0

"En este trabajo intentaremos demostrar que, aunque la parasíntesis no es propiamente un procedimiento para crear palabras en español, sí existen palabras parasintéticas. Para aclarar esta aparente paradoja examinaremos, en primer lugar, los distintos tipos de palabras analizadas generalmente como parasintéticas. Desechadas aquellas que se pueden justificar a partir de otros procedimientos de formación (esencialmente prefijación y morfo discontinuo) comprobaremos que las palabras parasintéticas realmente existentes se justifican en el marco de una lingüística del habla (Saussure) o de la actuación (Chomsky) más adecuadamente que dentro del sistema de reglas de formación de palabras (RFP) del español, que vienen a infringir.",1,0

"This article reports on a survey of the language learning strategies used by a group of Hong Kong learners. The aims of the study were to investigate levels of strategy use among the group, and to examine levels of association between strategy use and language proficiency. The SILL questionnaire (Strategies Inventory of Language Learning) by Oxford (1990, pp. 293-300) was used. SILL consists of six categories of strategies: memory, cognitive, compensation, metacognitive, affective, and social. The results showed that compensation and metacognitive strategies were the most used, while affective and memory strategies were the least used. Previous examinations of the nature of the relationship between strategy use and proficiency, and ways of measuring this are discussed. In this study, it was found that there was significant variation in proficiency in relation to eleven out of a possible fifty strategies. Of these, nine were in the cognitive category, one in the compensation category, and one in the social category. The article concludes by questioning the appropriateness of using the SILL and proficiency measure in tandem as a way of establishing a clear relationship between strategy use and proficiency, and suggests directions that might be pursued in language learning strategy research.",1,0

"abstract Conceptual metaphor theory and other important theories in metaphor research are often experimentally tested by studying the effects of metaphorical frames on individuals’ reasoning. Metaphorical frames can be identified by at least two levels of analysis: words vs. concepts. Previous overviews of metaphorical-framing effects have mostly focused on metaphorical framing through words (metaphorical-words frames) rather than through concepts (metaphorical-concepts frames). This means that these overviews included only experimental studies that looked at variations in individual words instead of at the broader logic of messages. For this reason, we conducted a meta-analysis ( k = 91, N = 34,783) to compare the persuasive impact of both types of metaphorical frames. Given that patterns of metaphor usage differ across discourse domains, and that effects may differ across modalities and discourse domains, we focused on one mode of presentation and one discourse domain only: verbal metaphorical framing in political discourse. Results showed that, compared to non-metaphorical frames, both metaphorical-words and metaphorical-concepts frames positively influenced beliefs and attitudes. Yet, these effects were larger for metaphorical-concepts frames. We therefore argue that future research should more explicitly describe and justify which level of analysis is chosen to examine the nature and effects of metaphorical framing.",1,0

"This article discusses the syntax of coordinate structures, in particular the status of initial coordinators, multiple coordination, and the asymmetries between conjuncts with respect to c-command relations. The idea of coordinators as heads – hence the CoP – is endorsed, but not for initial coordinators; rather they figure in a separate ‘distributive phrase’, which is transparently correlated to the (often ambiguous) semantics of the construction. Furthermore, it is argued that the lack of c-command between conjuncts is an instance of a broader effect, namely the ‘invisibility’ of paratactic material in general – and of second conjuncts in particular. Therefore, the grammar must have means to attach a paratactic constituent to the rest of the structure in a way that will eventually block c-command relations from the context. As this is not standardly available, we are led to define an operation called b-Merge, which induces a special type of inclusion relation, ‘behindance’. Thus, a modern revival of the 3D approach to coordination is brought about.",1,0

"The arrival of the Angevin king Charles I (1266) established Naples as the seat of the royal court. At the end of the 13th century, Naples became a world city thanks to the influx of culturally qualified people, and a city populated by fashionable people. This meant the city assumed a linguistic and cultural profile completely different from other areas of the kingdom. The simplistic statement of those who see Neapolitan as the only language spoken by the inhabitants of Naples would be unacceptable even in those times. Not even in the 14th century was Naples a «little place» only for natives. The different urban environments evoked in three novels of the Decameron (II, 5; III, 6; VII, 2) refer to the lively core of city life.",1,0

"La question des relations entre structure prosodique et structure syntaxique a ete largement debattue dans les annees 80, mais depuis que les travaux de prosodie s’interessent aux relations avec le discours et se fondent sur l’etude de corpus oraux, elle a ete delaissee. Pourtant, pour developper une grammaire prosodique, il nous semble essentiel (i) de reaffirmer l’importance des relations entre structure syntaxique et structure prosodique et (ii) de mettre clairement a jour leurs modalites de fonctionnement. En nous situant dans la lignee des travaux de Philippe Martin et de la theorie prosodique (cf. Selkirk 1978 et seq.) et en nous appuyant sur le corpus Anita Musso, nous soutenons que les constituants prosodiques (ici le syntagme phonologique et le syntagme intonatif) sont avant tout construits sur bases syntaxiques, puisque tres souvent les frontieres prosodiques s’alignent sur les frontieres droites des constituants syntaxiques. Selon nous, l’existence d’une telle relation entre syntaxe et prosodie ne remet nullement en cause l’idee selon laquelle les phenomenes intonatifs et accentuels sont autonomes et fonctionnent selon des principes qui leur sont propres.",1,0
"This study explores strategies in pro and anti-shale organizations’ discourse by combining the Discourse-Historical Approach (Wodak, 2001) with corpus linguistics. With the help of keyword lists, collocations, concordances, and key semantic domains, the representations of shale gas extraction, relevant actors and argumentation schemes in opposing discourses of the pro-shale Marcellus Shale Coalition and anti-shale Americans Against Fracking were analyzed. The findings of the study show that the advocates presented shale gas as a bonus for the crisis-struck American society while backgrounding its environmental impacts. The opponents, on the other hand, represented shale gas as a threat to the American ecosystem and public health through an alarming and scientific discourse. The empirical findings of this study add to a growing body of literature on discursive strategies employed by opposing camps of environmental controversies.",1,0

"Vingt ans après la guerre, la vie s’articule plus ou moins à Sarajevo. Les souvenirs restent, explicites ou tus. La vision de cette guerre, vécue dans l’encerclement multiple, a changé un peu. A-t-elle évolué? Il est difficile de le dire. La mémoire collective perçoit et interprète toujours certains faits comme guerriers (à tort ou à raison), certains d’autres comme des traîtrises car les plaies sont encore fraîches et ouvertes. Les mots d’argot bosniens, utilisés dans cette guerre, possèdent leurs euphémismes, leurs tabous, leurs évitements, leurs universaux, mais ils sont aussi différents des argots de guerre dans d’autres langues parce qu’un siège de trois ans n’est pas la même chose que la guerre des tranchés. Dans cette dernière guerre en Bosnie, les « autres » étaient multiples - les ennemis autant que les traîtres. Il s’agit d’une situation « argotisante » par excellence.

"For a number of years, I have argued that the child i s a spontaneous theoretician, i.e. that the way in which children go about discovering how the world functions (the physical, social and linguistic worlds) is by building theories, not by simply observing facts (Karmiloff-Smith, 1975, 1979a, 1984; Karmiloff-Smith & Inhelder, 1974/5; see, also, Brown, 1986, Carey, 1985, Gelman & Brown, 1985, Gillieron, 1982, Gopnik, 1982, Keil, 1988, Leslie, 1988). And children go about their spontaneous discovery task by behaving like the typical scientist. Kuhn (1977) was right in his view that only on the very rare occasions when scientists must actually choose between comFeting theories do they reason like philosophers or logicians! Both for the child and the adult researcher, scientific progress does not stem from the use of logical criteria on the basis of rational induction from observations. Indeed, as Lakatos (1977) has pointed out, the still widely held opinion that science progresses by repeated overthrow of theories on the basis of observational data is based on two false assump-",1,0

"IN THE SUMMER of icoi, the bullpen of the New York Giants boasted three deaf pitchers, George Leitner, Billy Deegan, and Luther Taylor.1 That combination is noteworthy because it represented the greatest number of deaf men who had ever played together for one professional team. That record still stands. However, they were not the only deaf players in baseball that year: William Ellsworth Dummy Hoy, playing for the Chicago White Sox, was still in the majors, nearing the end of his long career. He was just coming off an outstanding 1900 season, in which he led the American League in putouts, assists, and fielding average.The year 1901 marks the deafest season in major league baseball history. On the one hand, the fact that the wave should crest in 1901 is no surprise, for it had been building since the 18705. On the other hand, the prominence of deafness at the turn of the century demands explanation because in those days, unlike our own time, there was far more hostility toward deafness and disability in public view.2 How could a time less hospitable to disability in American life prove to have been more accommodating than our own? To trace the story to its beginnings, we must begin in the Midwest, specifically in Ohio, at the Ohio School for the Deaf. Ohio School for the Deaf (OSD)was founded in 1829, and it has the distinction of being the first residential school to introduce baseball as a team sport to its male students. In 1863 Parley Pratt had been hired to teach shoemaking. Then, in the early 18705, Pratt began coaching the baseball team there. As historian Susan Burch describes it, Particularly in the Midwest, strong athletic programs defined the school experience for many young boys. This was certainly the case at the Ohio School.3 In 1879, the school's baseball team went on a barnstorming tour, billed as the Ohio Independents Baseball Club. As the team's exploits were remembered in the silent press years later, The Ohio Independents played for glory as well as to show the people that the deaf were as good players as the hearing. They played several National League teams, including Cincinnati, Cleveland, Troy, and Syracuse, in exhibition games that summer, compiling a record of 6 and 2. They then returned to Ohio and toured throughout the state, playing various semiprofessional teams. By summer's end, they had traveled thirty-five hundred miles and gone 44 and 7.4 Their star pitcher was Edward Dundon (1859-1893), who had graduated from OSD as valedictorian in 1878. He went on to a brief professional career, the first Deaf man to do so. He pitched for two years (1883-1884) for the Columbus American Association team (record of 9-20). This was not the full extent of his time in baseball, however. He also played in various semiprofessional leagues, finally ending up in Syracuse, New York, in the International League in 1888 and 1889. Ill health finally forced his retirement; Dundon died from consumption in 1893 at the age of thirty-five.5 Undoubtedly, Dundon was an inspiration for many of his former teammates at the Ohio School. Indeed, in 1893, five Ohio School graduates reported that they were earning a living playing baseball, at a time when the overwhelming majority of their peers, 152 in all, were working in a very different field: farming.6 These five men played semiprofessionally, and none seem to have made it to the majors. But Dundon's teammate William Hoy eventually did. Hoy (1862-1961) attended the Ohio School from 1872 to 1879. He had played on Ohio's baseball team with Dundon during the school year. Although Hoy graduated from the school as valedictorian in 1879, he did not accompany the team on its 1879 summer tour. Coach Pratt thought him too small in size and too youthful. Instead, Hoy went home. In spite of his obvious intelligence, as evidenced by the fact that he had graduated at the top of this class, his hearing parents assumed that his future would be severely limited by his deafness. …",1,0

"This study provides the first wide-scale, apparent time, instrumental description of the Canadian Shift in mainstream Toronto English. In contrast with some previous findings, the Toronto data suggest that for the last 70 years or more the shift has not affected the high front lax vowel (i). We observe that the movement of the nonhigh front lax vowels (ε) and (æ) involves both lowering and retraction in Toronto English, although retraction is the primary direction of more recent change and the shift appears to be slowing down. Our findings also suggest that continued retraction of the vowel resulting from the low back merger is involved in the final stage of the shift. We do not find evidence of a chain shift but instead propose that a parallel shift is occurring and make reference to Vowel Dispersion Theory in our discussion.",1,0

在汉语的能性结构中，肯定式一般用“得”字表能力，而否定式“V 不 C”没有“得”字，却依然能够表达能力的意思，其“能性意义” 的解读从何而来一直是汉语句法研究的一个不解之谜。本文提出：能 性否定式“V 不 C”在句法结构上具有一个表达能性的位置，只是该 位置的“得”字在语音部门没有显形，而造成“得”字语音显形与否 的原因是韵律。具言之，“得”字不能在“V 不 CO”这类宾补俱全 的结构中显形，这主要源于汉语动词指派核心重音的机制：核心重音 的指派者“V 不 C”在韵律大小方面受到“最小词条件”的限制（不 能大于等于三个音节）。本文的这一分析既可以从句法结构上回答 “V 不 C”能性解读的来源，也可以推演解释能性结构的不同表达形 式。,1,0

"THE TERMS and clone, which have appeared in media with increased frequency in recent years, have acquired new meanings that demonstrate how media persons, who may be viewed as lexical avant-garde of contemporary American English, produce semantic change via language play. According OED (1: 1003), phrase again has been in language since 1382: WyclifJohn iii.3 But a man schal be agen. It was listed as a subentry in Noah Webster's American Dictionary of English Language (1828), where it was defined as to be regenerated and renewed; receive spiritual life. John iii. The phrase continued be listed as a subentry in other precursors Webster's Third (Goodrich and Porter 1875, Harris and Allen 1913, Neilson and Knott 1934). However, again was eliminated from Webster's Third (Gove 1961). Why? Perhaps answer lies in fact that in early 1960s again did not have sufficient currency be included, even as a subentry, in Webster's Third, for at that time phrase was used almost exclusively by Baptists. However, again was born again, this time as a hyphenated adjective, as a result of several major political and social events.

By 1978, had achieved such currency that it was added The World Book Dictionary (a lexicon that is revised yearly in order keep abreast of living language), where it was defined as follows: adj. U.S. believing in personal conversion as a way salvation through Christ; evangelical. Born-again is currently used not only as an adjective describing one who has accepted Christ, but also in media refer one who has been reborn or revitalized in any fashion, as following examples demonstrate.

"During the past two decades, field linguists have expressed serious concerns over the unprecedented rapid loss of ‘indigenous languages’, the endangerment of many others, and the implications of these processes for the education and economic development of ‘indigenous populations’, among other matters. The book to which this article responds is a rare volume that focuses on the use of ‘minority languages’ in education and national economies to eradicate poverty, as well as on socioeconomic hardships the poor experience in shifting to the ‘dominant language’. I explain how complex the subject matter is and how little prepared linguistics still is for it. I show that our profession has no empirically grounded and ecology-specific advice to provide to economists and politicians who are concerned with societal multilingualism (mis)construed as an obstacle to economic development. Nor does the field appear to have determined under what ideal socioeconomic conditions a language can be maintained without being a liability or an unnecessary burden to its speakers.",1,0

"Short videos depicting rural China have gained popularity on social media domestically and internationally. Among the genre’s creators, Li Ziqi stands out for her unique style of culinary craft, starting from the most basic materials. I interpret Li Ziqi’s mushroom videos as multimodal “argumentative meshworks” casting a counterstatement to the “involuted” urban life and nature/culture division. To unfold the analyses, I first place videos in the context of urban ills. Built on previous studies of multimodal argumentation and entanglement anthropology, I define “argumentative meshworks” in three aspects: a human-nonhuman entanglement, a simplicity-complexity harmony, and a production-audience interaction. Then I select three mushroom videos as artefacts to unpack the multimodal meshworks. Following the empirical call argumentation studies, I use viewers’ comments to support my points throughout the whole piece. This inquiry explores multimodal argumentation’s new possibility to not only stress things out but create space for harmony and peace of mind.",1,0

"El proposito de este articulo es llevar a cabo un estudio contrastivo entre las formas de plasmar el discurso referido que predominan en los teletipos de las agencias de noticias, y aquellas que resultan mas recurrentes en las informaciones redactadas por los propios redactores de diversos diarios espanoles. Se analizaran si existen diferencias sustantivas entre ambas clases de textos, especialmente en lo que atane al uso de los verba dicendi en la introduccion de la cita expresa, al empleo de los evidenciales citativos, o a las principales formas de citacion. Asimismo, trataremos de demostrar como, aunque la introduccion de otras voces enunciadoras parece otorgar a los textos periodisticos de caracter informativo apariencia de objetividad, en realidad, el locutor reproductor de la cita dispone de una gran libertad, por ejemplo, para interpretar la fuerza ilocutiva de los actos de habla, o para manipular incluso el discurso reproducido.",1,0

"El presente trabajo estudia la incidencia de la puntuacion en la comprension lectora del
discurso tecnico en lengua inglesa y su papel como factor de textualidad. Partiendo de este
concepto y de las funciones propias de la puntuacion formuladas por diversos enfoques
linguisticos, se ha llevado a cabo un analisis para cuantificar la habilidad descodificadora y los
conocimientos sobre puntuacion de 60 estudiantes de Ingenieria Aeronautica, asi como para
determinar la tipologia y las consecuencias de sus errores. El estudio se centra en el punto, la
coma y el guion dada la conflictividad de su uso al identificar los constituyentes oracionales
inmediatos y las relaciones semanticas. Los resultados obtenidos indican que la mayoria de los alumnos poseen un exiguo conocimiento de las normas de puntuacion y que apenas si
son conscientes de la influencia de esta en la inteligibilidad del texto. Los errores estan por
lo general relacionados con la utilizacion de la coma y se deben a un fenomeno de
transferencia linguistica, ya sea de las reglas de puntuacion en espanol, o de los habitos
prosodicos individuales al mensaje escrito, mientras que el criterio semantico predomina
sobre sonido y sintaxis a la hora de puntuar. Si bien su presencia ha sido tradicionalmente
escasa en los planes de estudio de las lenguas de especialidad, la puntuacion se nos brinda

"In The pronunciation of English in the Atlantic States (Ann Arbor, 1961), Hans Kurath and his collaborator, Raven I. McDavid Jr., have given us the first detailed study in structural dialectology that has ever been made of a large geographical area. In the present article, offered in Kurath's honor, I shall try to make a similar contribution in miniature: a structural analysis of the vowel of a single pair of words, involving part of the short-vowel system of part of German-speaking Switzerland. Following Kurath's example, I shall examine the vowel phonically, phonemically, and historically. The vowel which I have chosen for analysis is that of the present-tense verb forms (du) hast, (er) hat. It is an interesting topic for a study in structural dialectology because it shows how misleading a simple phonic presentation can be if it is not accompanied by phonemic and historical presentations as well. The data are taken from the field records of the Sprachatlas der deutschen Schweiz, in Zurich; they were made available to me through the kindness of Rudolf Hotzenkocherle, the director and editor of the Atlas.l In gathering the Atlas materials, the field workers did their recording impressionistically, using a highly flexible phonetic alphabet to note every shade of sound they were able to distinguish. Of interest to us here is the treatment of the front unrounded vowels. The symbol e was used for a mean-mid vowel, and diacritics were added for closer and opener values: a single subscript dot for close e, a double subscript dot for over-close e, a single subscript hook for open e, and a double subscript hook for over-open e (much like English a in bat). Intermediate values were indicated by parenthesizing the diacritics; a vowel even opener than over-open e was written with the ligature a?. If all of these phonic data for the words hast, hat were reproduced in map form, the resulting picture would be so detailed as to defeat the very purpose of cartographic presentation. In making Map 1, I have therefore combined some of these values, as follows: (1) plain and parenthesized close e are symbolized by a vertical line (no examples of over-close e were found in the data for hast, hat); (2) mean-mid e and plain and parenthesized open e are symbolized by a diagonal line; (3) x and plain and parenthesized over-open e are symbolized by a horizontal line. Using IPA symbols, I have written these three values as [e], [e], and [ae] respectively. A few remarks need to be made about the base map, which is taken from that of the Atlas. The area covered includes 425 of the 573 points in the Atlas,2",1,0

"Dean S. Worth In Memoriam Henning Andersen The Slavic linguistics community lost one of its great leaders in 2016. Dean Stoddard Worth, who lived in retirement in Lititz, Pennsylvania, passed away after a long illness on 29 February at the age of 88 years. Worth, who was born in Brooklyn, NY in 1927, earned his BA at Dartmouth College, studied Slavic languages in Paris at the École nationale des langues vivantes and at the Sorbonne (Diploma and Certificat 1952) and went on to Harvard, where he completed the PhD in 1956 with a dissertation on a problem in Russian syntax, written under the supervision of Roman Jakobson. In 1957 he hired on at UCLA, where he rose through the ranks, retiring in 1994. During his career Worth made significant contributions in Russian linguistics, descriptive as well as historical, with early publications on syntactic problems and numerous papers on morphophonemics and morphology, especially word formation. In many other studies he applied linguistic analysis to Russian texts from all periods, chronicles as well as literary, from the Igor’ Tale to Kantemir. He produced more than a dozen papers on rime and metrics, both in classical and in oral literature, where he showed a special interest in the Russian lament. His many studies of the language of these many text types from different periods formed the background for contributions to our understanding of the historical development of the Russian literary language. Besides publications in Russian linguistics, Worth wrote several studies of the southern Kamchatka language Kamchadal (Russian Itel’men). He also edited and coedited several conference volumes and was editor of the International Journal of Slavic Linguistics and Poetics from its first issue (1959) to its last (2006). In between he wrote some fifty reviews, about a quarter of the items in his list of publications. Two collections of Worth’s research articles were published (1977, 2006). The latter lists his publications through 2004. Among Worth’s book-length publications are a volume of edited Kamchadal texts, a Kamchadal dictionary, a Russian derivational dictionary (1970), a bibliography of Russian word formation (1977), a two-volume bibliography of Slavic linguistics (1966, 1970), and a monograph on the development of Russian grammar writing (1983). At UCLA Worth played a decisive role in his department’s development into a preeminent center of Slavic studies, the result of judicious hiring and a [End Page 269] stream of visiting lecturers and professors from Slavic countries. He served several terms as department chair, as director of the Advisory Committee of the UCLA Center for Russian and East European Studies, as well as on a variety of campus-wide committees. Beyond the walls of the university, Worth served on, and at times chaired, both the American and the International Committee of Slavists and at various times was a consultant to the RAND Corporation, the National Science Foundation, the American Council of Learned Societies, and the Social Sciences Research Council. Over the years Worth was awarded research funding from the John S. Guggenheim Memorial Foundation, the International Research and Exchange Board, the National Science Foundation, and the National Endowment for the Humanities. In 1984 he was awarded the UCLA College of Letters and Science Prize for Outstanding Achievement in Teaching, Research, and Service. In 1992 he received the Award for Outstanding Achievement in Scholarship from the American Association of Teachers of Slavic and East European Languages. He was honored by colleagues with a Festschrift to celebrate his 65th birthday, and former students marked his 70th birthday and 40th anniversary at UCLA with a Festschrift for him in 1997. His students and colleagues will remember him for his high standards in teaching and scholarship, his generosity, his hospitality, and his spirit of conviviality. Dean Worth is survived by his wife, Professor Emerita Emily Klenin, and by a niece and two nephews.

"that the same (or closely allied) shifts occur in many Algonquian languages. Specifically the languages in which I have thus far been able to establish that the shifts take place are Fox, Kickapoo, Cree (see below), Montagnais (see below), Shawnee, Ojibwa, Algonkin, Potawatomi, Peoria, and Delaware. Since these shifts are shared by so many Algonquian languages, and since these languages are in substantial agreement in the shifts, it is clear that these changes must be very ancient, and presumably in their beginnings go back to the Algonquian parent-language. I have derived my examples, for Fox, from Jones's Texts (references by page and line) and my unpublished texts, and notes in a few cases (for the principle differences between Jones's and my phonetics see p. 54 of this Journal); for Kickapoo, Jones's Tales (references by page and line); for Cree, Lacombe's grammar and dictionary; for Montagnais, Lemoine's grammar and dictionary; for Shawnee, Gatschet's manuscripts in the Bureau of American Ethnology and my early Shawnee notes; for Ojibwa, Baraga's grammar and dictionary and Jones's Texts, Volume I (references by page and line); for Algonkin, Cuoq's grammar and dictionary;",1,0

"The Effects of Age on Stroop Interference in Clinical vs. Healthy Groups of Children The Stroop task is widely used to assess attentional dysfunction due to a frontal or frontoparietal deficit and is also thought to be related to the maturation of the prefrontal cortex. The study aimed to prove the diagnostic usefulness of the Polish Names and Colors Interference Test (TINiK) in a clinical setting and to investigate the pattern of performance on four TINiK subtasks according to the type of brain damage (focal or diffuse) and age of the patients. A total of 107 subjects (62 female, 45 male) aged 11-18 were divided into two groups: children aged 10;4-14;6 and adolescents aged 14;7-17;10 within each diagnostic category: healthy (H - 35), heterogeneous focal brain damage (BD - 36) and cardiac arrhythmia (CA - 36). The number of correct responses in the 60s time limit was collected for each TINiK task. The H group significantly outperformed both clinical groups. The H and CA groups show improvement of performance systematically with age on all TINiK subtasks although at a different level. The BD group displayed merely non-significant developmental improvement especially among the adolescent group. A discriminant analysis using the four basic TINiK scores was able to significantly differentiate the BD from the H group (83.1%) and the BD from the CA group (74.6%), but less well the CA from the H group (63.9%). TINiK has acquired preliminary neuro-psychological validation in Polish children. Developmental improvement in interference control may be hampered by various neuropathological mechanisms which are yet to be identified.",1,0

"Drawing on fifteen video-recorded planning meetings as data, and on conversation analysis as a method, I examine the interactional import of the common Finnish practice of constructing a proposal as a thought. As a point of departure, I consider two different types of conditional utterances in which a speaker presents a plan: (1) ‘asking conditionals’ ( jos ‘what if’ prefaced declarative conditionals and interrogative conditionals) and (2) ‘stating conditionals’ (declarative conditionals). While asking conditionals mark the plan as contingent on the recipient’s approval and involve a straightforward request for the recipient to engage in joint decision-making about the proposed plan, stating conditionals are regularly treated as informings about plans in which the recipients have actually no word to say. However, when asking and stating conditionals are prefaced with references to the speakers’ thoughts ( mä aattelin et ‘I was thinking that’), the projected responses and sequential trajectories are more open-ended: The participants have the opportunity to share the responsibility, not only for what is to be decided with respect to the proposed plan, but also for what is to be jointly decided upon in the first place. Constructing a proposal as a thought seems thus to be a practice with which participants may enable the symmetrical distribution of deontic rights at the very beginning of joint decision-making sequences.",1,0

"In today's rapidly changing society, the ability of an individual to effectively design their future becomes highly important. It is the youth when a person acquires the ability to realize the project of their future. Constructing life goals and plans for their implementation by youth is carried out in the process of information exchange, life experience expansion and reflection of their semantic cognitions in social communications. The success depends on the characteristics of their image transformation into concepts, their statements' reflection, and their interpretation of other people's statements. The article aims to reveal the psycholinguistic features of designing the future by adolescents and youth. The method of the free association test, along with Leontyev's (2003) method of five-year intervals, was used for empirical research. 120 undergraduate and graduate students aged 17 to 21 from the National Pedagogical Drahomanov University, Ukraine, participated in the study held in 2021. Its results showed that most respondents created their goals mainly in marital, family, or professional modes. The objectives of spiritual growth and personal self-realization were autonomously constructed only by a few respondents. Participants with explicit nuclear semantic cognitions and corresponding associative fields, including altruistic associations, revealed prolonged, consistent, realistic structures of their life goals. In contrast, respondents with underdeveloped structures of semantic fields mostly created intermittent, time-limited structures of life goals with somewhat formal cognitions of satisfying their needs in the future.",1,0

Trois types de nouvelles syllabes sont distingués: cellles creéés par recombinaison d'initiales et de finales déjà existantes; celles ayant une finale inédite; et celles violant en apparence la phonotactique cantonaise, comprenant deux consonnes labiales, ou ayant pour initiate un groupe muta + liquida. Les syllabes de ce dernier groupe sont en fait conformes à la phonotactique de vieux mots cantonais appartenant aux couches lexicales les moins littéraires: onomatopées etc. Ces syllabes, comme celles des deux premiers groupes forment des combinaisons segmentales autorisées par la phonotactique cantonaise, et dont l'inexistance était accidentelle.",1,0

"THE DISCOURSE BASIS FOR LEXICAL CATEGORIES IN UNIVERSAL GRAMMAR Paul J. HopperSandra A. Thompson State University ofNew York,University of California, Los BinghamtonAngeles Most linguists who have investigated linguistic categories from a universal viewpoint have accepted the existence of two basic parts of speech, noun and verb. Other categories are found to be only inconsistently represented; thus adjective is manifested in many languages as a class of Stative verb. Furthermore, individual languages often have intermediate categories such as gerund, which cannot be unambiguously assigned to a single category. We suggest here that the basic categories N and V are to be viewed as universal lexicalizations of the prototypical discourse functions of 'discourse-manipulable participant' and 'reported event', respectively. We find that the grammars of languages tend to label the categories N and V with morpho-syntactic markers which are iconically characteristic of these categories to the degree that a given instance of N or V approaches its prototypical function. In other words, the closer a form is to signaling this prime function, the more the language tends to recognize its function through morphemes typical of the category—e.g. deictic markers for N, tense markers for V. We conclude by suggesting that categoriality itself is another fundamental property ofgrammars which may be directly derived from discourse function.* Introduction 1. The classification of the lexicon into categories or 'parts of speech' has been a concern of linguists since ancient times. This paper offers a new approach to the many problems raised when linguistic categories are considered from the aspect of universal grammar. 1.1. Categories. Over the centuries during which the Western grammatical tradition has evolved, the criteria for determining categories have shifted according to trends in linguistic thought as a whole. These criteria have included the following: (a)Morphological. This criterion takes the possibility of a form's combining with different types of inflectional morphemes as the basis for identifying categories.1 A noun is thus defined as a form which is 'declined' according to case, number, and gender (case being primary, indeed to some extent synonymous with 'noun'); a verb is a form which is 'conjugated' according to person, tense, and mood. This criterion clearly derives from a grammatical tradition within a classical Indo-European speech community; but in fact it extends remarkably well, as we shall see, to a wide range of non-IE languages. (b)Semantic. That the major categories are associated with fairly consistent semantic classes was recognized by the earliest grammarians. Thus Dionysius * We are grateful to several people whose comments have helped shape this study: Raimo Anttila, Joan Bybee, Wallace Chafe, Bernard Comrie, Jack Du Bois, John Haiman, Carol Lord, Francesca Merlan, Edith Moravcsik, Johanna Nichols, Michael Noonan, and Kenneth Whistler; and to Christian Matthiessen for help in preparing the manuscript. Authorship of this paper, as with all our joint work, is shared equally. 1 However, Lyons (1966:217) rejects the characterization 'morphological' for this approach. 703 704LANGUAGE, VOLUME 60, NUMBER 4 (1984) Thrax defined the noun (onoma) as 'a part of speech inflected for case, signifying a person or thing' (Robins 1979:33). The difficulty of applying semantic or 'notional' criteria consistently has been a perennial problem; yet the broad correlation is so obvious that linguists have repeatedly returned to it in one form or another. (c) Syntactic. Syntactic arguments for determining boundaries among word classes go back to earliest times; the distinction between 'subject' and 'predicate ' was well known to the Hindu grammarians, and was equated by them with the noun/verb distinction (Lyons 1968:19-20). Furthermore, the Greek term rhêma 'verb' appears originally to have referred to the predicate of the sentence (Robins 1979:26-7), rather to than the (conjugated) verb. Purely syntactic arguments are also used by modern structural linguistics; thus, in the transformational/generative paradigm, the criteria for assigning forms to the major categories are linked to the usefulness of the classification to the formulation of rules: 'The way in which we have arrived at the particular decisions [about word classes] ... is, in principle, irrelevant ... What matters is whether one classification rather than another enables the grammarian to formulate a set of rules which will include...",1,0

"Owing to economic exigencies, civil wars, political instability and natural disasters, many people are forced to abandon their homes, brave ‘fear of the unknown’ and seek refuge in other countries with or without guarantee for their safety, employment opportunities and refugee status. Often economically dominant countries, which normally are viewed as greener pastures, do attract refugees from starving nations. For most of the migrants language poses a further challenge if their home language is not spoken in the host country – which is a normal phenomenon. This seemingly has repercussions on migrants’ employment prospects, as well as their access to information and health services. It is surmised that linguistic challenges may make a person a target of immigration officers’ insults, police brutality and illegal deportations. Hence, this article aims to explore the language experiences of transnational migrants and to suggest strategies to deal with these linguistic challenges and promote the harmonious c...",1,0

"Este trabajo sobre la pluralizacion del verbo haber existencial tiene en cuenta, por primera vez, datos tanto peninsulares como insulares rurales. No se trata solo de un fenomeno caracteristico del area valenciano-catalana, ya que tambien existe en la Region de Murcia y en las islas Canarias. Asimismo, se manifiesta esporadicamente en otras comunidades. La comparacion con trabajos sobre el habla urbana indica que en las provincias valenciana, castellonense y grancanaria la pluralizacion es mayor en el habla rural. Aunque los hombres pluralizan mas que las mujeres, la variable extralinguistica del genero no es relevante en el modelo mixto de regresion logistica. A pesar de que hay mas casos pluralizados del preterito imperfecto de indicativo que de otros tiempos verbales, tampoco ha resultado un factor estadisticamente significativo. Lo mismo se concluye para el grado de animacidad del argumento. La forma verbal, al contrario, si es un factor decisivo, ya que las perifrasis propician la pluralizacion de haber. En definitiva, distintos factores tanto extra como intralinguisticos influyen en la pluralizacion del verbo haber existencial en las variedades rurales del espanol europeo.",1,0

"Reviewed by: Identité, modernité, texte Gladys Jean Morris, M.W., Herron, C. et Estin, C.-R. (2004).Identité, modernité, texte. New Haven (CT) : Yale University Press. 432 p., 55 $US, broché. Identité, modernité, texte est un manuel consacré à l'enseignement de la langue, de la littérature et de la culture françaises et déstiné à des étudiants de français langue étrangère de niveau intermédiaire inscrits dans une université américaine. Les auteurs soulignent qu'il s'agit de l'aboutissement d'un long travail de coopération entre les auteurs américains (Matthew Morris et Carol Herron) et Colette-Rebecca Estin, professeur dans le système universitaire français, travail qui a permis d'allier pédagogies américaines et françaises et d'établir des rapprochements entre les cultures francophones et américaines. La méthodologie employée dans ce manuel est aussi un heureux amalgame, selon les auteurs, de pratiques traditionnelles et de pratiques modernes et expérimentales. Ce livre s'inspire du manuel intitulé Vignettes, écrit par Carol Herron qui a paru chez Harper and Row en 1984. [End Page 445] Les quatre objectifs pédagogiques principaux du manuel Identité, modernité, texte sont d'améliorer les connaissances en français des étudiants (en lecture, à l'oral, à l'écrit et en grammaire), de les exposer à la littérature, d'élargir leurs connaissances culturelles et de développer leurs habiletés de recherche. Le manuel se divise en quatorze chapitres, chacun basé sur un texte littéraire contribuant à développer le thème de l'identité. Les chapitres sont regroupés dans cinq sections, chacune se concentrant sur un genre particulier : l'autobiographie, la poésie, le récit imaginaire, le théâtre, l'essai. Les textes choisis sont tous parus au 20e siècle, entre 1914 et 1978. À l'exception de trois auteurs (Samuel Becket, Aimé Césaire et Pauline Julien), tous les auteurs choisis proviennent de la France (Queneau, De Saint-Exupéry, Sartre, Prévert, Camus, Levi-Strauss, Tournier, etc.). L'approche de l'étude de la langue française se fait de toute évidence par le texte. Une grande attention est portée à la préparation à la lecture et au développement de stratégies de lecture. En fait, la préparation à la lecture de chaque texte est un processus assez long. On commence en général par l'explication d'une ou de plusieurs stratégies de lecture que l'on met en pratique à partir d'extraits de la lecture qui va suivre. Ensuite, on fait une certaine préparation par rapport à certains éléments de vocabulaire en relation avec le thème de la lecture. On passe ensuite à une présentation de certains éléments grammaticaux que l'on retrouvera dans le texte du chapitre. Parfois, on peut retrouver un exercice de type mécanique mettant en pratique l'élément grammatical visé. Les explications grammaticales se limitent en général à une liste dans le cas des locutions prépositives ou à la forme dans le cas des temps ou modes de verbes. Les explications grammaticales sont suivies d'une biographie de l'auteur du texte choisi, d'une description du contexte dans lequel l'uvre a été écrite et d'une description fort utile de la perspective historique et du climat culturel l'entourant. Une préparation personnelle se fait aussi avant la lecture du texte qui implique des questions que le professeur utilise à sa guise; les étudiants peuvent s'exprimer sur le thème qui sera abordé dans le texte. Le manuel conduit ensuite les étudiants à travers toute une série d'étapes de post-lecture qui ont pour but de mener à la compréhension du texte et aux procédés littéraires utilisés, ainsi qu'à une réflexion personnelle sur le sujet et à une analyse critique du texte. On présente ensuite une diversité d'activités d'approfondissement et de recherche (dans le dictionnaire, sur Internet, à la bibliothèque). Toutes ces étapes de pré-lecture et d'après lecture, regroupées sous une vingtaine de rubriques différentes, constituent le corps du manuel (les textes n'occupant que 35 des...",1,0

"Extract 0. Recent discussion about the status of time within nexus 1 Thanks are especially due to Carl Ebeling and Frederik Kortlandt for stimulating discussions and correspondence. deserves a more general treatment. In the following sections, nexus will be defined and analyzed as a development from less complex syntactic structures. The discussion focuses on the referential mechanisms responsible for the time depth presented by nexus. More generally, if the use of speech as a symbolic system derives from “the power of the higher apes to solve specific problems by abstracting general forms or schemata from the details of given situations” (Sapir 1985: 14), it may be feasible to reconstruct a succession of mental abstractions in the development of syntax. To take Sapir's conjecture to its logical consequences, his abstracted “schemata” will serve as a conceptual starting point from which the more complex referential mechanisms observable in language have evolved. The lack of material evidence for this development does not allow the description of successive stages to be conclusive in any way. Instead, the account aims at being maximally plausible as a link between ordinary perception and linguistic semantics and syntax.",1,0

"When the Greeks borrowed the alphabet they took over the Semitic qoph as well as kaph, and they employed the former before back vowels (e.g. Corinthian hipolkes, Kapbv), but in the course of time p was crowded out by K. Scholars have inferred that the extra letter served no useful purpose, because there was no phonemic difference between K before back vowels and in other positions. Similarly the Etruscans borrowed both p and K from the Greeks, and on some early Etruscan inscriptions the use of q is limited in the same way as Gk. p, while k is used only before the vowel a. Etruscan, having no voiced mutes, employed c (from Gk. F) as a voiceless velar mute, and in later Etruscan this character crowded out the other two. Again we may infer that early Etruscan q, as well as k, did not represent a different phoneme from c. Early Latin inscriptions also show the three letters c, k, and q, and there is a tendency to distribute them in the early Etruscan manner. In the course of time k dropped out of standard use except in a few abbreviations, and again we infer that there was no phonemic distinction to be denoted by k. Standard Latin orthography, however, retained q in the digraph qu. We may therefore suspect that this digraph denotes something different from the sound of c plus the sound of consonantal u. Some of the Roman grammarians, to be sure, thought that q, as well as k, was a superfluous letter,' but their testimony about q is worth no more than the statement that h is a superfluous letter since it is a breathing (aspiratio); what these authors really have in mind is that the standard Greek alphabet has just one letter where the Latin alphabet has c, k, and q. Velius Longus 7.75.10 f. K suggests that qu was written instead of cu for the purpose of distinguishing words that would otherwise have been homographs:",1,0

"Abstract A growing number of family language policy studies have started to pay more attention to the emotions that transnational multilingual families (TMFs) identify regarding their multilingual identity, even if much of the research remains primarily focused on TMFs residing in Europe and North America. This article reports on a qualitative study that explored the emotions that five TMFs residing in Russia identified with their multilingual identity, and how these emotions affected their family language policy. The study combined ethnographic elements in the form of video recordings and two rounds of semi-structured interviews. The findings indicated that the parents felt pride and satisfaction in their own multilingual identity yet feared that their children were developing a monolingual identity, which led to them experiencing anger and frustration. Coupled with these negative emotions, they were found to adopt monolingual practices with their children in hopes of making them more multilingual. The study adds to our understanding of how emotions, multilingual identity, and family language policy interact in TMFs outside of Europe and North America and is one of the first studies to explore the experiences of such families in Russia.",1,0

Semejante clasificacion ha sido llevada a cabo en los diccionarios desde tiempo inmemorial y, en principio, es perfectamente justificable: mucho antes de haberse anunciado la practica, y mucho menos la teoria, de los diccionarios didacticos, los lexicografos ya habian actuado partiendo del concepto intuitivo de que el diccionario ha sido creado para ensenar el manejo del lenguaje y, para hacerlo, debe ser puesto en consonancia con una teoria gramatical cualquiera.",1,0

"With a focus on descriptions provided in Richard Rodriguez’ Hunger of Memory, Alice Pitt’s “Language on Loan” and Alice Kaplan’s French Lessons, this article analysis the psycho-emotional situation of significant language learning for both: child and adolescent monolingual migrants, and host-foreign language students studying abroad. It is an examination of the unconscious meaning behind linguistic relocations. This work pays close attention to the manner in which acquiring a new language unveils subjects’ affect and history of learning. It looks into host-foreign language immersions and acquisition in relation to our human nature, universal needs and responses to host-foreign language immersions and learning. Drives and defenses behind young language migrants’ embodiment of a new language are discussed through questions of desire, identifications and need for individuation. Central to this paper is also the exploration of how significant learning, as a cognitive-emotional experience, is tied to differing forms of aggression. This work asks: What can migrants’ and foreign language students’ desire to learn host- second languages tell us about their inner realities and about the meaning they knowingly and unknowingly attach to an acquired host-foreign language? How may host-foreign language acquisition aid in learners’ psychic growth? To what extent does significant learning become a module in young subjects’ process of self-reinvention? And finally, and at the heart of this article, how is significant language acquisition tied to crises, identifications and matricide?",1,0

"In this paper, we describe a framework for developing probabilistic classifiers in natural language processing. Our focus is on formulating models that capture the most important interdependencies among features, to avoid overfitting the data while also characterizing the data well. The class of probability models and the associated inference techniques described here were developed in mathematical statistics, and are widely used in artificial intelligence and applied statistics. Our goal is to make this model selection framework accessible to researchers in NLP, and provide pointers to available software and important references. In addition, we describe how the quality of the three determinants of classifier performance (the features, the form of the model, and the parameter estimates) can be separately evaluated. We also demonstrate the classification performance of these models in a large-scale experiment involving the disambiguation of 34 words taken from the HECTOR word sense corpus (Hanks 1996). In 10-fold cross-validations, the model search procedure performs significantly better than naive Bayes on 6 of the words without being significantly worse on any of them.",1,0

"Este trabajo propone analizar la representación de la pobreza como fenómeno social, desde la perspectiva de los medios de comunicación.

Se realizó una clasificación de estrategias discursivas existentes y se identificó cuáles habían sido utilizadas en las notas; luego, la información presentada mediante estas fue contrastada con la realidad social del país. Posteriormente, se revisaron estos conceptos a la luz de un marco teórico que aborda los temas de: pobreza, estrategias discursivas, representaciones lingüísticas, teorías de la comunicación y periódicos digitales. Una vez establecidas algunas referencias teóricas, se hizo posible relacionar las intencionalidades que posan detrás de las estrategias empleadas, lo cual permitió observar cómo la pobreza se convierte en un fenómeno social que se debate entre la ficción y la realidad.",1,0

"Aims and objectives: Our study addresses the following research questions: To what extent is L2 comprehenders’ online sensitivity to morphosyntactic disambiguation cues affected by L1 background? Does noticing the error signal trigger successful reanalysis in both L1 and L2 comprehension? Can previous findings suggesting that case is a better reanalysis cue than agreement be replicated and extended to L2 processing when using closely matched materials? Design/methodology/approach: We carried out a self-paced reading study using temporarily ambiguous object-initial sentences in German. These were disambiguated either by number marking on the verb or by nominative case marking on the subject. End-of-trial comprehension questions probed whether or not our participants ultimately succeeded in computing the correct interpretation. Data and analysis: We tested a total of 121 participants (25 Italian, 32 Russian, 32 Korean and 32 native German speakers), measuring their word-by-word reading times and comprehension accuracy. The data were analysed using linear mixed-effects and logistic regression modelling. Findings/conclusions: All three learner groups showed online sensitivity to both case and agreement disambiguation cues. Noticing case disambiguations did not necessarily lead to a correct interpretation, whereas noticing agreement disambiguations did. We conclude that intermediate to advanced learners are sensitive to morphosyntactic interpretation cues during online processing regardless of whether or not corresponding grammatical distinctions exist in their L1. Our results also suggest that case is not generally a better reanalysis cue than agreement. Originality: Our three L2 participant groups’ native languages were carefully chosen so as to create systematic typological contrasts. Our experimental materials and conditions were more closely matched compared to previous studies on German object-initial sentences, and our experimental design allowed us to link participants’ reading profiles to successful comprehension. Significance/implications: L1 influence on L2 processing is more limited than might be expected. Contra previous findings, even intermediate learners show sensitivity to both agreement and case information during processing.",1,0

"This article investigates yod dropping, i.e. the loss of the onglide after the coronals /t, d, n/, in Toronto English. Previous research has shown that this change is almost complete in Canadian English. However, most work has drawn on self-reported data rather than actual speech, and few studies have taken word frequency into consideration, although it has been shown to play a major role during earlier stages of the change. Combining auditory and acoustic analysis of production data from 20 speakers from the Greater Toronto Area, this study confirms that the change towards the yod-less pronunciation is largely complete. As in other varieties, there is considerable acoustic overlap between test words that historically had yod ( new ) and those that did not ( too ). This highlights the need to move away from predetermined cut-off points for determining yod presence, which are common in previous work, and find diagnostics that will allow us to distinguish between yod retention and /u/-fronting, another change that is currently underway in Canadian English (see also Roeder et al. 2018).

"As we enter the 21st century, we find ourselves living in intensified globalization, characterized by global cultural flows of people, technologies, money, images, and ideas (Appadurai 2020). Language is evolving in response to socio-cultural changes. As such, linguistic innovations via mass media offer a particularly interesting locus to track such global flows. This paper aims to study how popular lexicons in female address terms have emerged out of digital communication and have been widely used and interpreted by different communities interacting with mass media in contemporary China. As China is increasingly integrated into the global economy, the widespread of media networks, such as WeChat, QQ and Microblogs, has increasingly provided Chinese citizens with access to new words and new ways of using old forms. The study thus enquires as to the origin of these linguistic innovations, the linguistic resources required to bring about such changes, the motives for developing such online resources, and the responses by Chinese citizens to these media-induced language changes. By addressing these issues, this paper is oriented toward exploring the role of mass media in language change as well as the relationship between language, identity and ideology, in China, in the context of globalization. Our findings suggest that Chinese female address terms have emerged via mass media, by coining, borrowing, reapprorpiating older forms for new meanings, and by employing multimodality. These media-induced language innovations are not simple responses to the broader socio-cultural changes occurring inside and outside of China. Instead, Chinese citizens, through creating, using, or promulgating new popular lexicons, are able to construct, negotiate, and make sense of multiple selves across those digital spaces. Therefore, Chinese mass media has generated a network of “figured worlds”, within which individuals' identities and agencies form dialectically and dialogically in global cultural processes (Holland et al. 1998). In particular, the circulation of certain female address terms across digital spaces involves the enregisterment of words as part of a sexist register, which has perpetuated the ideologies of male dominance in contemporary China. Both individual and institutional efforts have been made to respond to such sexism and reconstruct gender images and identities.",1,0

"The need for zero in linguistic description is widely agreed upon, and few linguists would want to eliminate the concept entirely: grammatical descriptions would become too complicated and run the risk of losing important generalisations. Nevertheless, one needs to exercise caution in postulating zeros, in presuming that some element of linguistic form is actually present when there is no manifest substance. This article has three main aims. One is to examine the notion of zero in linguistics, and discuss circumstances under which it is reasonable to postulate its presence in the face of nothing in the expression-substance. A second is to argue that in certain circumstances it is useful to identify not zeros of grammatical form, but rather nothings - thus the nothing that is! Third, the need for a reappraisal of the notion of zero in linguistics is suggested: this mathematical metaphor is misleading, and should be replaced by a less dangerous one.",1,0

"Co-authored by a discourse analyst, a branding expert and medical researchers and practitioners, this paper presents a multimodal discourse analysis of advertisements for contraceptive products in magazines and journals aimed at general practitioners, gynecologists and obstetricians. It combines genre analysis and multimodal image, layout, colour and typography analysis to show how such advertisements link specific types of women to specific products and product attributes and benefits, and how product branding invokes values such as health, sexual freedom, sexuality, femininity, strength and reliability, which combine in different ways to create distinct identities for specific products. The findings show that the way the advertisements link products and users does not align with medical evidence, and that in general they do not represent the full range of factors that play a role in choosing contraceptive methods and products - indeed, they are far removed from the realities of the consultation room.",1,0

"During the last decade, interdisciplinary researchers have developed technologies with animated pedagogical agents that interact with the student in language and other communication channels (such as facial expressions and gestures). These pedagogical agents model good learning strategies and coach the students in actively constructing knowledge during learning. This article describes computer technologies that have been developed during the last decade with tutors that attempt to facilitate deep comprehension (e.g., causal explanations, plans, logical justifications), reasoning in natural language, and inquiry (i.e., question asking, question answering, hypothesis testing). These tutors target high school and college students who learn about topics in science and technology. The primary example is AutoTutor, a system on the Internet that helps students compose answers to deep-reasoning questions and solutions to problems by holding a conversation. AutoTutor's dialogue moves include feedback (positive, ne...",1,0

"Depuis le Cours de linguistique generale, les linguistes ont , en general , soutenu le principe de l'autonomie selon lequel la linguistique pour devenir une science doit se couper des autres disciplines pouvant egalement se donner un objet dans le langage . C'est sur cette base d'ailleurs , que la linguistique a longtemps recu l'hommage des autres sciences humaines , sciences dont elle passait pour etre le modele . Ces dernieres annees cependant , des contestations aussi bien <r internes » qu' « externes » sont venues remettre en question cette situation : des sociolinguistes, mais aussi des linguistes-sans-prefixe et des sociologues ont , de facon plus ou moins explicitet mis en doute la forme particuliere d'idealisation sur laquelle repose le travail linguistique et le lien de necessite qu'elle entretiendrait avec le caractere scientifique de ce travail . C'est pourquoi il m'a paru a la fois possible et necessaire d'organiser une suite de debats reunissant des linguistes representatifs de courants divers et des sociologues pour reflechir sur les possibilites d'intersection entre la linguistique et la sociologie du langage ; et ensuite pour tester , ulterieurement , les formes de collaboration envisageables .

冯胜利的《汉语历时句法学论稿》是一部真正意义上的、独树一帜的理论研究作品。这部论著向我们展示了汉语句法的历史演变。该书的主旨在于介绍如何借助形式句法学工具更好地理解和解释汉语的句法演变机制。作者深入地考察了数个基本句法结构的历史发展(把字句、致使结构和被动结构、双及物结构、述补结构等)，并讨论了汉语在不同时期显示出的综合性vs. 分析性特征等问题。作者的研究显示，在汉语的句法结构演变中，有两个现象扮演了举足轻重的角色，即轻动词结构和韵律形态(后者与自汉代开始的双音化现象有关)。冯胜利提出的这些开创性的分析将使该书成为所有关注汉语历史句法的语言学研究者必不可少的研究工具。,1,0

"Discussion Note Sanford B. Steever Steever replies: Author Schiff man states that, apart from the 125 lapses in copyediting, typesetting, and the like—whose incidence would surely trigger a recall in a more mundane consumer product, the remaining 125 criticisms maybe dismissed because they are not really problems at all but merely reflect a philosophical difference between author and reviewer. The difference S would urge us to accept, however, strikes me as less lofty than the term ‘philosophical’ suggests: The grammars that linguists tend to prefer, pedagogical or scholarly, are those based on clear, accurate, and reasoned descriptions of the language. It is the dearth of such qualities in RGST that places its utility in serious doubt. Readers may decide for themselves whether, for example, the book’s numerous errors of fact should be treated as copyediting gaffes or philosophical differences. Since RGST is not a biography, the author’s intentions, experiences, classroom anecdotes, etc., matter only as they directly in form the book; to the extent they do not, they constitute digressions irrelevant to its content. S’s most explicit statement of purpose (p. i, repeated on the dust jacket) notes that he wrote RGST to make it ‘accessible to students studying the modern spoken language as well as to linguists and other specialists [emphasis added]’. The book is actively marketed to linguists; it is not structured as an ordinary language text, and its references cite the scholarly not the pedagogical literature. For these reasons and others, no special explanation is required for writing a linguistically oriented review of RGST. The use of Tamil writing to represent ST is not objectionable in itself, only when it is used, as in RGST, to obscure the text and detract from such substantive issues as the accurate description of the language. Whether RGST’s examples can successfully function in spoken Tamil is not raised in the review; but since S asserts a radical difference between WT and ST (i), the use of written sources to supply examples of spoken Tamil undermines his claim that he is writing about the spoken variety. My review calls not for a linguistically informed survey of the grammatical literature on Tamil but merely for RGST to take seriously a dozen or so of the works cited in the body and listed in the references. It is not their methods and models which should concern the ordinary language student but their empirically superior descriptions. Both RGST and the author’s reply confuse grammatical terms with the linguistic realities they purport to describe; in doing so, S trivializes Paramasivam’s elegant analysis as a mere terminological alternative when in fact it provides a far more satisfactory description of paired verbs than S does. Despite S’s stated aversion to fancy linguistic terminology, he introduces such terms as ‘performative’ and ‘illocutionary force’ in the book. In sum, RGST’s use of ‘transitivity’ is as careless and unmotivated as its use of ‘illocutionary force’. S’s reply would skirt the critical process by suggesting that his 30 years of teaching experience validate RGST, whatever its shortcomings maybe. However, with so few substantive changes between the 1979 and the 1999 versions, as well as the problems common to both, the last 20 years seem not to have figured very prominently in that experience. The reply discusses various intentions, beliefs, and speculations apart from the text: One belief attributed to me is that S ‘either ignored this material, was unaware of it, failed to comprehend it, or failed in [his] responsibility to present the issue’. Such conclusions presuppose that he was paying attention to the issues; as the many lapses in the production values of the book attest, it is equally possible that he was not. Finally, S’s claim that mine is the most negative review he has ever read needs to be understood in this context: The review is not unrelated to the content of his book.

"In the context of five learners’ dictionaries, we examine the treatment of certain systematic relationships in the semantics and syntax of the English verb and find a lack of systematicity in this aspect of the lexicography. We present detailed evidence to support our criticism, including citations from a corpus of general English. We suggest that the discrepancies arise because of an inadequate representation of the native speaker’s knowledge of the English verb system. Drawing on linguistic research into the verbal classification scheme of English, we construct a ‘dictionary-neutral’ summary of the semantic-syntactic relationships pertinent to the verb bake, designed to enable the lexicographer to make principled decisions about the content and presentation for a specific dictionary. On the basis of this summary we offer a revision of an entry for bake, showing that a theoretically motivated analysis, if clearly presented, will ease the lexicographer’s task and improve the quality of the lexicography.",1,0

En concreto, se discute la necesidad del exsoberano de recurrir a la denominada estrategia de Sherezade para garantizar la continuidad de la monarquía y rehabilitar la imagen maltrecha de la Corona española. Rememorando los hitos más significativos de su reinado, a modo de breve folletín de una vida ejemplar, Juan Carlos I cuenta una ‘historia moralizante’ que apunta a producir en la audiencia un sentimiento de protagonismo, seguridad e implicación en una ‘saga común’. Asimismo, se examina el papel central de la analogía en el hilvanado argumentativo, aludiendo a las posibles falacias y a la paradoja del comediante que se vislumbran en un discurso en el que las condiciones de éxito parecen primar sobre las de sinceridad.",1,0

"The headwords in the three regional dialect dictionaries of the southern Dutch dialect area-the Dictionary of the Flemish Dialects (WVD), the Dictionary of the Brabantic Dialects (WBD) and the Dictionary of the Limburgish Dialects (WLD)-are 'Dutchified' forms: that is, headwords are rendered in Standard Dutch orthography and generalize across a number of phonologically distinct dialect forms. This article explains how the Dutchification of headwords was operationalized in the Dictionary of the Flemish Dialects. It is shown that a number of so-called correspondence rules can be found that mediate between dialect and Standard Dutch phonology and which form the basis of Dutchification. Phonological models confirm this lexicographical intuition; the work of Rys (2007) is used to exemplify the correspondence rules with examples from the Maldegem dialect.",1,0

"In current use, scrod has two closely related senses. In the first, presumably reflecting the perspective of the fishing industry, it is a small—under two-and-a-half-pound—cod or other similar fish, as a haddock, hake, or pollack. In the other, reflecting the perspective of the fish seller and consumer, it is such a fish that has been split and boned, or filleted. In the second sense at least, scrod is probably now widely recognized in the United States, but there is a strong, and justified, popular association with Boston. In fact, as I will show, the word was formerly confined, in this country, to the eastern—but not the southern—coast of New England; it is also well established in Newfoundland, but apparently nowhere else in the Englishspeaking world. The etymology of scrod is a problem. Since a satisfactory etymology must account for the earliest attested meanings and forms of the word and also for its geographic distribution, I begin by reviewing the early—that is, chiefly nineteenth-century—evidence bearing on those points. I will concentrate on the U.S. evidence, which has never been satisfactorily assembled, and treat more briefly the Newfoundland evidence, where I have little to add to the excellent treatment in the Dictionary of Newfoundland English (DNE 1982). I then discuss the etymologies that have been proposed, and finally I suggest a new explanation which I believe accounts more satisfactorily for all the evidence. The earliest known example of scrod dates from 1841. Unfortunately, it tells us little about the meaning of the word, merely describing someone as “supplied with a few ship biscuit, a dried scrod, a bottle of good swizzle” (A Dictionary of Americanisms [DA] 1951). Somewhat more informative is a passage from Joseph Reynolds’s Peter Gott, the Cape Ann Fisherman (1856). Summarizing a boyhood fishing venture of the hero, he says: He worked diligently through the season, and after paying for his dory, his lines and bucket, and his clams for bait, his earnings at the close of the year amounted to eighty dollars, in addition to which he had a pile of nice scrods, and as many salted fish for winter as the family needed. [91–92] From this it would appear that “scrods” are distinct from salted fish but can be kept for some time. I have not been able to find any biographical information on Reynolds, but some authorial asides suggest that he was a",1,0

"Preface of the guest-editor and former editor When resigning from my office as editor of Folia Linguistica, which I held from volume 15 (1981) to 39 (2005), I was asked to guest-edit this first semi-volume 40/1–2 of 2006. Therefore this introduction has a double function. The first is the deep-felt obligation of the former editor to thank all who have helped me in editing, first the previous and actual members of the editing board, most of all Oskar E. Pfeiffer (Vienna), who has been my alter ego for the whole period of my editorship, and without whose unfailing help and meticulous control of the editing process, I would have been unable to carry out my job. Next I have to thank, in chronological order, Mario Palaschke, Katharina Korecky-Kröll, and Markus A. Pöchtrager, who performed most of the computational work after the transferral of the production from Hungary (where first József Molnár and, after his death, Ferenc Kiefer had overseen it, both to be thanked as well) to Vienna. Many thanks are due to the readers who evaluated the manuscripts submitted, and, finally, to the Secretary/Treasurer Dieter Kastovsky (assisted by Christine Klein), and the members of the Societas Linguistica Europaea for their support. The second function is the guest-editor's duty to introduce the topic of the special issue on Natural Morphology, a field of research where I have been involved from its very beginning.

"Recent studies have shown that shì ‘be’… (de) focus sentences in Mandarin Chinese are not structurally uniform. One of the criteria to make distinctions among them is the Adjacency Condition, that is, only the right adjacent element of shì can be focused. The debate has been centered on the question of why this restriction only holds in certain types of sentences involving focus but not in all of them. We argue that the so-called Adjacency Condition is not a primary condition that regulates the distribution of different types of foci; instead, the presence or the absence of adjacency-like restriction precisely indicates the existence of two different syntactic structures involving foci: one gives rise to the adjacency effects, whereas the other one does not. Importantly, our central proposal is that any constituent that falls under the c-command domain of shì will have a chance to get a focus reading if prosodically prominent, which naturally holds for the constituents that are not adjacent to shì. Along this line, shì is analyzed as a focus domain indicator rather than the focus marker itself.",1,0

"5XtHERE did the word ballyhoo in the sense of a barker's spiel, noisy Vv advertising, etc., come from? On page 188 of the fourth edition of his Smerican Language (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1936), Mr. Mencken summarized three explanations: (1) It is connected with the name of Ballyhooly, a village in Cork County, Ireland. This explanation is given by Webster's NID (1934) and by Eric Partridge's A Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English (New York: Macmillan and Co., 1937). (2) It was a blend by circus people of ballet and whoop. (3) It originated on the Midway of the Chicago World's Fair of 1893 and was an imitation of the cry of dervishes in the Oriental Village, b'allah hoo, meaning 'Through God it is.' But Mr. Mencken accepted none of these explanations, for on page 19l of his book he listed the word among a group whose origins were yet to be discovered. All three bore to him the marks of being popular etymologies. I should like to suggest, as Eric Partridge very tentatively does under ballyhoo, that a search into seamen's talk might lead toward an answer to the question. A possible clue I find in Melville's Omoo (1847), in a passage in Cllapter 76. An Irish sailor is warning two men against shipping on the vesse] that he is on: 'And it's shipping yer after, my jewels, is it? . . . thin arrah! my livelies, jist be after sailing ashore in a jiffy.... Be off wid ye, thin, darlints, and steer clear of the likes of this ballyhoo of blazes as long as ye live. They murder us here every day, and starve us into the bargain.' By 'ballyhoo of blazes' the speaker meant an outcast ship, a pariah. The ship from which the sailors developed their derogatory 'ballyhoo of blazes' is the ballahou (ballahoo, ballyhoo), a fast-sailing, two-masted vessel, rigged with high fore-and-aft sails, much used in the West Indies. The foremast rakes forward, the luainmast aft. The word apparently took a long time to make its way into the dictionaries. I find it first in the Imperial Dictionary of the English Language by John Ogilvie, revised by Charles Annandale (London: Blackie and Son, 1882). Thence it passed to the Century Company's American reprint of the Imperial Dictionary in 1883; from there to the Century Dictionary (1889). It is in \tebster's International Dictionary of 1890 and in Funk and Wagnalls'",1,0

"La comprension lectora es fundamental en el exito academico universitario, por lo que se espera que el estudiante que ingresa a la educacion superior posea competencias lectoras suficientes, lo que, a menudo, no es asi. Este estudio tuvo por objetivos establecer, por un lado, el nivel de comprension lectora con el que ingresa un grupo de estudiantes a una carrera de pedagogia y, por otro, describir las estrategias de lectura que emplea un sub grupo de dichos estudiantes. Para ello, se realizo un estudio mixto de corte transversal de alcance descriptivo, sobre la base de una muestra no probabilistica, en el que se aplicaron dos instrumentos: una prueba de comprension lectora (Lectum 7) y un protocolo de pensamiento en voz alta. Los resultados revelan un desempeno promedio general bajo, con una comparacion de lectores habiles y menos habiles que arroja una diferencia significativa en cuanto a nivel de comprension lectora, y una comparacion entre estudiantes con y sin estudios superiores previos favorable a los primeros. Ademas, se observa una diferencia en la eficacia con la que se emplean estrategias de comprension lectora, que muestra una mayor reflexion por parte de los lectores habiles. Finalmente, es posible concluir que el empleo de estrategias y la experiencia con distintos tipos de texto son factores que inciden en el desempeno lector.",1,0

"The topicality of the research is justified by intensification of distractive communication between Internet users and by lack of understanding how to regulate such speech behavior, as the social function of internet-mediated communicative environment is still undetermined. The paper explores communicative features of threats-punishments and threats-warnings verbalized through written communication mediated by gadgets with access to the Internet. The aim of the research is to define the perlocutionary effect produced by verbalized threats based on written communication. Threats are understood as utterances containing a message about harmful consequences of the action of a threat sender towards a recipient of the threat if he or she will or will not do some action demanded in the threat. Verbalization means that threat is articulated in speech communication and realized in verbal form. The research hypothesis is tested on the basis of 68 threatening messages in the Russian language retrieved from contexts of speech communication in internet-messengers and on social network sites. We prove that the addresser (threatening person) verbalizes treats mostly in the form of punishments describing possible damage to the addressee’s (recipient’s) life and or health. We found out that threatening speech acts verbalized on the Internet are mostly similar in form and content to those realized in face-to-face communication. However, Internet threats are mostly determined as a reflection of emotional-modal state of the addresser in response to the actions of the addressee. Men are more active in the verbalization of threats-punishments, whereas women verbalize more threats-warnings. People tend to protect themselves by ignoring threats addressed to them. The obtained results clarify the idea of Internet-threat as affected speech behavior, the regulation of which is impossible within the framework of the existing legislation; therefore it is necessary to develop a criteria base consistent with public morality, with the participation of expert and academic communities and technological companies.",1,0

"People reject ‘paradoxical’ inferences, such as: Luisa didn't play music; therefore, if Luisa played soccer, then she didn't play music. For some theorists, they are invalid for everyday conditionals, but valid in logic. The theory of mental models implies that they are valid, but unacceptable because the conclusion refers to a possibility inconsistent with the premise. Hence, individuals should accept them if the conclusions refer only to possibilities consistent with the premises: Luisa didn't play soccer; therefore, if Luisa played a game then she didn't play soccer. Two experiments corroborated this prediction for three sorts of ‘paradox’, including a disjunctive paradox.",1,0

"Abstract The aging population is rapidly growing, requiring speech–language pathologists to better manage a caseload that includes older adults who have a variety of needs. The purpose of this review is to summarize and discuss the current available evidence that will allow speech–language pathologists to make informed clinical decisions when working with older adults. To facilitate this, this article first establishes an understanding of both normal and disordered swallowing physiology in older adults, including how to differentiate between functional changes to swallowing (presbyphagia) and dysphagia. Other important factors to consider, such as caregiver burden, are also discussed so that clinicians can learn how to best support aging in place. Best practices for screening both community-dwelling older adults and residents of long-term care are identified as part of a framework introduced to guide decision making. The critical components of clinical swallow assessments are reviewed, including the adoption of an ethnographic approach and why nutritional status, urinary tract infections, and delirium are important considerations when working with older adults. Factors contributing to, and associated with, aspiration and aspiration pneumonia are also discussed so that clinicians better understand how to take a comprehensive approach to care, as well as consider the impact and influence of a temporary dysphagia versus a more chronic presentation. Finally, the evidence for management of dysphagia in this specialized population is reviewed, highlighting the importance of identifying physiological deficits, feedback, and taking a multidisciplinary approach to care.",1,0

"Abstract I show that speaker bias in polarity focus questions (PFQs) is context sensitive, while speaker bias in high negation questions (HNQs) is context insensitive. This leads me to develop separate accounts of speaker bias in each of these kinds of polar questions. I argue that PFQ bias derives from the fact that they are frequently used in conversational contexts in which an answer to the question has already been asserted by an interlocutor, thus expressing doubt about the prior assertion. This derivation explains their context sensitivity, and the fact that similar bias arises from polar questions that lack polarity focus. I also provide novel evidence that the prejacents of HNQs lack negation, and thus only have an outer negation reading (see, e.g., Ladd in Papers from the seventeenth regional meeting of the Chicago Linguistic Society, vol. 17, pp. 164–171, 1981; Romero and Han in Linguistics and Philosophy 27(5):609–658, 2004; Krifka in Contrastiveness in information structure, alternatives and scalar implicatures, pp. 359–398, 2017; AnderBois in Questions in discourse, pp. 118–171, 2019; Frana and Rawlins in Semantics and Pragmatics 12(16):1–48, 2019; Jeong in Journal of Semantics 38(1):49–94, 2020). Based on a treatment of HNQs as denoting unbalanced partitions (Romero and Han in Linguistics and Philosophy 27(5):609–658, 2004), and competition with their positive polar question alternatives, I propose a novel derivation of speaker bias in HNQs as a conversational implicature. Roughly, if the speaker is ignorant, then a positive polar question will be more useful because it is more informative, so the use of an HNQ conveys that the speaker is not ignorant. The denotation of the HNQ then makes clear which way the speaker is biased. The result separates high negation from verum focus, and I argue that it is more parsimonious and has better empirical coverage than prior accounts.",1,0

摘要 美洲印第安原住民自古以来就使用各种表达方式表情达意，表达思想和记录事实，其中象形文字是最为印第安原住民普遍使用的表达方式，这种情况至少延续到上个世纪初。印第安原住民使用的象形文字从其使用功能的角度可以大体分成通俗用象形文字和萨满用象形文字。通俗象形文字为部落成员普遍知晓并自如应用于社会生活的各个方面。萨满用象形文字则基本上用在仪式场合中，与祈祷、吟唱、舞蹈、仪式表演等多种形式共生相伴，相互补足，共同服务于仪式上演的需要。总结印第安原住民两类象形文字的使用情况，能够为汉字起源研究提供新的材料和研究思路，进一步夯实和拓宽文字学理论建设的视野。,1,0

"The line dividing the Austronesian languages into Western Malayo-Polynesian (WMP) and Central-Eastern Malayo-Polynesian (CEMP) is drawn east of Sulawesi and through the middle of Sumbawa. A number of phonological or semantic changes are claimed as forming the basis of this distinction, as well as the typological profile of the languages to the east being different from those to the west, and a number of lexical items being attested only east of the line. We examine the phonological and semantic innovations, as well as the erratic morphological ones, showing that none of them define the CEMP line, but indicate that (a) the Central Malayo-Polynesian (CMP)–area languages do not convincingly meet the criteria commonly accepted for a subgroup or even a linkage, (b) some of the WMP-area languages exhibit more of the same features found in at least some of the CMP-area languages than do others, and (c) many of the traits ascribed to the CMP- or CEMP-area languages can be found in more conservative WMP-area or Formosan languages as well.",1,0

"Famous South Korean writer Park Kyongni’s novel «Daughters of Pharmacist Kim» covers the period from the end of the 19th century to the beginning of the 20th century which was tragic for Korean people and their social norms because of the Japanese occupation. It depicts particularly the religious beliefs of Korean people, the relationships in the society and the family, the role of the woman, and the daily life of people of different social groups (aristocrats, the wealthy, servants). The objective of this article is to critically analyze the translation of the novel that touches upon many phenomena exotic for most Russian readers, such as the national identity of Korean culture or the material and spiritual life of Korean society. The comparison of the Korean and the Russian texts shows that the translation of some ethnographic realia does not quite match the original. For example, some words related to the following phenomena are translated incorrectly: Korean traditional underfloor heating (ondol), superstitions, Koreans’ religious beliefs and their perception of ancestors’ spirits, supernatural forces, mourning ceremonies, and attire worn to a funeral. In addition to believing in ancestors’ spirits, Koreans also believed in prophecies. For example, children of someone who died of arsenic poisoning were believed to be destined to leave no male offspring. This prophecy comes true in the novel: Pharmacist Kim’s first son dies in childhood and six daughters are born afterwards. Koreans paid special attention to shamans and believed in their supernatural essence. To this day, Koreans’ religious beliefs dating back to ancient times and various folk beliefs peacefully coexist with other world religions. In modern South Korea, people still observe customs and traditions related to funeral rites and wakes, they fear and revere the spirits of the dead, and perform «feeding ancestors’ spirits» ceremonies twice a year on certain days chosen according to the lunar calendar. In addition to the shortcomings of the Russian translation described above, some dialectal items of the Southern province Kyungsan-do are translated incorrectly, and so are occasionally rendered the rules of the traditional verbal etiquette. It may be considered as a gross error because the latter are anchored in the very essence of Korean language and make up an important part of Korean mentality. Conclusion. So, this analysis of conveying background information through Korean realia in the novel «Daughters of Pharmacist Kim» confirms the theorists’ conclusion that the translator must know background cultural information of the source text. Errors and flaws found in the translation of some ethnographic realia show that those errors and flaws are not likely to affect significantly the novel’s content or its artistic value. At the same time, the fictional quality of the novel is affected by the lack of translator’s knowledge of its dialectal peculiarities and some facts of non-material culture related to customs, elements of cult and public relations among Koreans. All of the above leads to the incorrect perception of some cultural realia of Korea described in the novel of Korean classic writer Park Kyongni.",1,0

"Gone With The Wind ( GWTW ) (1936) merupakan salah satu novel Amerika yang  merekam pengalaman perbudakan kaum kulit hitam dan perang sipil yang dibayangkan terjadi pada era antebelum Amerika  melalui sudut pandang kulit putih. Dengan memusatkan padakarakter protagonist perempuan kulit putih Selatan, pengarang berupaya untuk memberadapkan kehidupan “Old South” yang memiliki institusi ganjil perbudakan, dan mengutuk perang sipil yang telah memporak-porandakan kehidupan harmonis di Selatan. Inilah yang menjadi isu problematik yang ingin dianalisis dalam tulisan ini. Mengapa novel GWTW berupaya memuliakan kehidupan di Old South pada era sebelum perang sipil Amerika? Dengan perspektif hegemoni, penelitian ini menemukan bahwa novel GWTW merupakan salah satu sarana untuk mempertahankan narasi kolonial putih. Melalui representasi kehidupan harmonis di Selatan yang tampak pada tampilan perempuan dan laki-laki kulit putih yang rupawan, hubungan yang harmonis antara budak kulit hitam dan majikan kulit putih, gender, alam Selatan yang kaya raya, serta stratifikasi sosial menegaskan bahwa kehidupan di Old South pada masa antebelum merupakan gambaran kehidupan yang harmonis. Ini berarti bahwa protes terhadap perbudakan dan munculnya perang sipil merupakan hal yang tidak benar karena hal tersebut hanya memporak-porandakan tatanan kehidupan yang sudah mapan di Old South.berdasarkan temuan penelitian ini, dapat disimpulkan bahwa novel GWTW merupakan merupakan kelanjutan dari wacana kolonial kulit putih yang muncul di era pasca kolonial (pasca perbudakan) untuk melegitimasi kekuasaan mereka.  Gone With The Wind(GWTW) (1936) is an american novel which recorded the imagined experience of Black slavery and Civil War in the United States of America (pre and post-1865) based on the eye of WhiteSoutherner.Centered upon the SouthernWhite female protagonist character, the author sought to civilize the Old South life in antebellum Americawhich owned the peculiar institution of slavery and condemned the Civil War as it was rumaging the harmonious life in the Old South. The problematic case to be exposed in study is why and how the novel seemed seeks to glorify the life in antebellum Souththat embraced racism in the odd slavery institution? By hegemony perspective, this study found that the effort to civilize the Old Southin this novel is a way to persist the colonial White narration about the slavery institution. Through the depiction of Southern Belle and gentlemen hero, the natural landscape, the harmonious relation between Black slave and White master affirmed the life in the South was harmoniuos and stable. It means that the protes towards the Black enslavement and Civil War became irrelevant. To sum up, the discourse of White colonialisme to legitimate their power as a ruler in society is continued to be constructed in post-colonial discourse, as this novel appeared in the twenty century.",1,0

"A expansao da Educacao Superior, ocorrida nas ultimas decadas, fez com que o magisterio nas universidades passasse a ser exercido por profissionais das mais diversas areas do conhecimento. Com isso, muitos profissionais acabaram se tornando docentes universitarios de forma improvisada e, por consequencia, tornando precaria sua funcao docente. O presente artigo tem por objetivo analisar de que forma a utilizacao da metodologia investigacao-acao pode contribuir para identificar os limites e potencialidades da docencia universitaria no contexto da improvisacao docente. Tornar a pratica docente objeto de investigacao-acao possibilita o exercicio metodologico qualitativo onde os proprios sujeitos se tornam parte da investigacao.

"Abstract Social media platforms have given rise to diverse ‘reading formations’ (Bennett and Woollacott, 1987) from bespoke reading communities with strong affective bonds to the ‘ambient affiliation’ (Zappavigna, 2014) more typical of followers of reading-related hashtags (#amreading). What makes all of these formations distinctive is that they ‘bring into visibility an entirely new social dimension to reading’ (Pinder, 2012:68), and a sociality that is often reliant as much on the sharing of images as on words. This article will focus specifically on shared acts of reading on Instagram, a social networking service for sharing photographs and videos. In particular, I will explore the phenomenon of the #bookstagram where readers share images of the book they are currently reading aestheticised and personalised through the use of evocative backdrops and objects. Such activities are all too often dismissed as empty displays by narcissistic millennials keen to make their mark in the ‘attention economy’. However, I will argue that the #bookstagram offers a way for readers to share acts of reading with others in a way that evokes the sensory and the sensual, and also provides a form of ‘embodied reenactment’ (Tolins and Samermit, 2016) that can generate discussion and empathy between users. My analysis will focus on the ways in which body parts, especially hands, feature in the images to evoke a sense of an embodied connection between reader and book. I will also examine how the images create a strong sense of reading as a situated activity that is associated with calmness, serenity and being close to nature. My discussion of emerging reading practices is informed by theories which move away from an exclusive focus on reading as a series of mental processes or the decoding of signs, to consider reading as a distributed, embodied activity that involves interacting with others and one's environment. The analysis of the #bookstagram will examine how the activity can be located in relation to culturally and historically grounded practices relating to the book as object of display and to representations of reading bodies from visual art. However, I will also be arguing that the specific affordances of social media help produce readerly interactions that are dialogic and reliant on an ethos of participation where displays of intimate and private acts are routinely commented on and repurposed by others.",1,0

"Abstract It is widely recognized that semantic bleaching is a prominent concomitant of grammaticalization. The reductive process may eliminate the core semantic element and lead to an emergence of a marker of seemingly incongruous notions. This paper addresses one such type of semantic reduction in Korean, the case of the multi-functional connective - cani . Historically, - cani originated from a hortative sentential ending - ca and a connective - ni through morpho-syntactic coalescence eliminating intervening forms. The resultant form - cani was initially used to signal hortative and causal, but later to mark hypotheticality, contingency and incidentality. The development of the hortative-based connective cani- occurred through two channels: (i) the direct quotation channel and (ii) the complementizer channel. One prominent aspect of the development is semantic change, i.e., a progressive reduction of volitionality. At the outset, its semantics had strong volitive element, i.e., imposition of the speaker's volition on the addressee and the speaker together, the defining characteristic of hortative. In its later development into a marker of hypotheticality, the hortative meaning is significantly bleached and the use becomes highly rhetorical. The speaker is strategically invoking a hypothetical hortative pseudo-quotation in order to make his/her statement more dynamic or vivid. As the form acquires the rhetorical and discursive functions, its volitional semantics becomes further bleached, and it is entirely lost when the form reaches the contingency- and incidentality-marking stages. This paper shows how the speaker's discursive strategy has given rise to the emergence of diverse grammatical functions.",1,0

"Guinea-Conakry, West Africa, was one of the only countries of sub-Saharan Africa to reject the colonial language along with colonial rule, at least in basic education. Under its first president, Sékou Touré, Guinea adopted eight major national languages as media of instruction for primary and middle school levels. Language emancipation through education was part of Touré's platform of combining a socialist economy and nationalist ideology. Unfortunately, education in national languages did not survive past Touré's administration but died with him in 1984. Since then, the entire schooling system has depended solely on French, a language that very few Guineans speak at home. Meanwhile, national languages have continued to play a role in other domains, and in current educational, linguistic and political circles there is talk of bringing these languages back into formal education. Using data gathered from various documentary sources, combined with a synthesis of our interviews and discussions with teachers, literacy facilitators, education authorities, linguists and decision makers, this paper discusses the potential for Guinean languages to be re-emancipated in official policy and national practice. We also describe the approach of one NGO to support this re-emancipation through experimental schooling in Soso, one of Guinea's three most widely spoken languages.",1,0

"Kin terms are reconstructed for Proto-Polynesian, Proto-Tongic, Proto-Nuclear Polynesian, Proto-Ellicean, Proto-Ellicean Outlier, Proto-Eastern Polynesian, Proto-Central Eastern Polynesian, Proto-Marquesic, and Proto-Tahitic. The Proto-Polynesian system seems to have contained about as many distinctive terms as some of the more complex systems of today, such as those found in Tongan, Rennellese, Taumako, and Eastern Polynesian languages, where complex refers to a language that names more distinctions. It is suggested that languages with fewer distinctions, such as Samoan and the Ellicean Outliers, have simplified over time. Some of the reconstructions are questionable, especially at the Proto-Polynesian level, because of distributions that are limited to Tongic and languages that have clearly or potentially borrowed from Tongic (East Uvean, Anutan, Tikopian, and, to a lesser extent, East Futunan). Rennellese seems particularly conservative among the Outliers and has a number of agreements with Tongic not known from Nuclear Polynesian-other than languages that have borrowed from Tongic. At least two explanations are possible for the conservatism of Rennellese: the larger scale of its society in terms of numbers of people and in terms of named roles or relations of importance, and (2) it may include undetected borrowings from Tongic or languages that have borrowed from Tongic. Hawaiian kin terms are exclusively Marquesic where such matters are determinate. Hawaiian shares a number of demonstrable sporadic sound changes in kin terms with its Marquesic relatives (Marquesan and Mangarevan). It may share some such changes with Tahitic, but all such cases are indeterminate because the forms concerned are lacking in Marquesan and Mangarevan. This is consistent with comparisons of general vocabulary that suggest that, despite the prominence of Tahiti in the oral history of Hawai'i, Hawaiian remained a language dominated by its Marquesic roots",1,0

提要 本文探析汉语的 “一X 就 Y” 格式的下位类型区分，分别对其中小类的格式意义作了描写，它们不同的格式意义一方面源自 “一” 与 “就” 的原始意义，另一方面是句法环境作用的结果，格式意义形成以后会影响所组成词汇意义的选择。从类型学的角度看，“一X 就 Y” 格式从时间关系发展为条件关系的动因是句内语义环境从现实转为非现实，它表达规律性语义的句法条件主要有不能带已然标记、以类名词作主语、以时段表示事件时间以及添加条件句标记、认识情态标记和频率标记等，这一格式句法和语义的衔接界面，可构拟一个操作性极强的语义生成流程。,1,0

"The goal of this contribution is to research and assess the role of collocations in bilingual dictionaries, based in this case on an examination of dictionaries and their criticism. Along the way B. Steinbügl has to make clear what might become her starting-point, namely what is best considered to be collocations, how to reconcile her findings with current lexicographic approaches and, before arriving at some conclusions, what is the current practice in several existing German-English dictionaries of unequal size. Having briefly examined views of collocations in German linguistics, represented by Hausmann mostly, and in English linguistics (Firth, Halliday, Sinclair) she seems to prefer a wider British approach, based on statistics, although she does not say this in so many words (pp. 3–16, Chapter I). She does point, among other things, at the problem of the collocations ordering in dictionaries. Supposing that collocations should find their way into a dictionary structure, the obvious question the author asks is where and how. Should a binary collocation be given here under its base word or its collocate (collocator) or under both? This question unfortunately implies that the base word is always clear which might be the case with autosemantic words (here the author seems to adopt the views of Hausmann), but hardly with grammar words. Another of several interesting problems she raises touches upon the possiblity of a symmetrical presentation of collocations in a billingual dictionary. Is it possible or advisable to have them on both sides of a dictionary or should one respect the traditional and accepted view that dictionaries should respect their primary goal of coding or decoding (active and passive dictionaries)? Although the question might seem futile and impractical suggesting or, perhaps, only implying that such a dictionary should merge all of the relevant parts of an entry in a similar way to suit equally both Germans and English, it is definitely worth thinking about, though not in the sense of returning to the old indiscriminate practice of past. In such a case, collocations on both sides would hardly be symmetrical and a way of their discrimination and presentation of differences in usage would have to be found. It might well be that one is not equipped so far with descriptive tools to do this. Obviously, a lot of additional context would be needed, among other things.",1,0

"El artículo presenta los resultados de una evaluación aplicada a estudiantes de 3º y 4º año de dos establecimientos de Educación Media Técnico-Profesional (EMTP) de la Provincia de Ñuble, con la finalidad de determinar el dominio en la producción escrita de un ensayo argumentativo. Se realizó una investigación cuantitativa descriptiva con un diseño transversal a una población compuesta por 202 alumnos. Los resultados demuestran un desempeño aceptable en la producción de un ensayo con un 60% de logro en la muestra total, donde la dimensión mejor lograda es adecuación y las más descendidas son partes del discurso y argumentación, revelando dificultades para escribir y comunicar ideas, reconocer y aplicar la estructura básica del discurso argumentativo junto con el desarrollo del pensamiento analítico y reflexivo.",1,0

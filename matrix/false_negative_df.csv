"In this paper, a novel unsupervised speech enhancement algorithm is proposed assuming that both speech spectrogram and its temporal gradient are sparse. This assumption is reliable due to quasi-harmonic nature of speech signals. In the proposed method, speech enhancement is performed by minimizing an appropriate objective function composed of a data fidelity term and sparsity imposing regularization terms. Alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is adapted to solve the proposed model, and an efficient iterative algorithm is developed for speech enhancement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other competing methods in terms of different performance evaluation metrics.",0,1
"The article examines verbs of silence in Ancient Greek and Latin: σιγᾶν, σιωπᾶν, silēre. Following an examination of the usages, probable origins and semantic nuances of each of these verbs, as well as of their cognates and derivatives, it is shown that Gk. σιγᾶν and Lat. silēre probably derive from the PIE hushing interjection *si, whereas σιωπᾶν/σιωπή must result from a contamination of σιγᾶν with a rarer, but well attested, σωπάω/σωπή.",0,1
"The British neurologist Henry Head (1861–1940) in 1926 published a work entitled Aphasia and Kindred Disorders, which has been described as one of the most significant contributions to the field. The paper discusses the background to the appearance to this work. It focuses on Head's claim to have made a startling new departure in the study of aphasia. He is shown to have been among the first workers in the field to have been aware of the bearing of contemporary developments in linguistics on the study of language disorders. Head also insisted on the need to study the condition of aphasic patients in a much more intensive and extensive way than had hitherto been attempted. To this end he developed an elaborate battery of tests designed to assess various aspects of symbolic performance. He was, however, only able to make full use of these techniques due to the fortuitous availability in the aftermath of the First World War of a class of patient able and willing to participate fully in these investigations. Despite Head's claims to have revolutionized aphasia studies, he felt constrained to try to localize the syndromes he had identified in a traditional fashion.",0,1

"Despite increasing reports of pharmaceuticals in surface waters, aquatic hazard information remains limited for many contaminants, particularly for sublethal, chronic responses plausibly linked to molecular initiation events that are largely conserved across vertebrates. Here, we critically examined available refereed information on the occurrence of 67 antipsychotics in wastewater effluent and surface waters. Because the majority of sewage remains untreated around the world, we also examined occurrence in sewage influents. When sufficient information was available, we developed probabilistic environmental exposure distributions (EEDs) for each compound in each matrix by geographic region. We then performed probabilistic environmental hazard assessments (PEHAs) using therapeutic hazard values (THVs) of each compound, due to limited sublethal aquatic toxicology information for this class of pharmaceuticals. From these PEHAs, we determined predicted exceedances of the respective THVs for each chemical among matrices and regions, noting that THV values of antipsychotic contaminants are typically lower than other classes of human pharmaceuticals. Diverse exceedances were observed, and these aquatic hazards varied by compound, matrix and geographic region. In wastewater effluent discharges and surface waters, sulpiride was the most detected antipsychotic; however, percent exceedances of the THV were minimal (0.6%) for this medication. In contrast, we observed elevated aquatic hazards for chlorpromazine (30.5%), aripiprazole (37.5%), and perphenazine (68.7%) in effluent discharges, and for chlorprothixene (35.4%) and flupentixol (98.8%) in surface waters. Elevated aquatic hazards for relatively understudied antipsychotics were identified, which highlight important data gaps for future environmental chemistry and toxicology research.",0,1
"La phrase averbale est une phrase qui comporte un predicat averbal, c'est-a-dire, nominal (substantival, adjectival), pronominal, adverbial ou prepositionnel, passionnant, ce livre! heureux les pauvres! dans notre premiere partie, nous avons evoque les problemes theoriques que peut poser la phrase averbale. Nous avons essaye de comprendre ce qui constitue l'assertion averbale et comment celle-ci se constitue. Nous avons mis en evidence deux types fondamentaux de phrases averbales. Dans l'un, le sujet et le predicat averbal sont relies par la modalite : le sujet est alors explicite ou implicite. Dans l'autre, le predicat averbal est pose par la modalite : le sujet est inexistant. Nous nous sommes demande s'il n'y avait pas un continuum entre ces deux types de phrases. Dans la phrase averbale, les modalites (assertion, exclamation, interrogation, injonction) peuvent se decliner en toutes sortes d'actes de langage. La phrase averbale peut etre concernee par les categories de la personne, du temps, de l'aspect et de la voix, meme si le predicat averbal reste peu touche. Selon nous, la phrase averbale ne doit pas s'analyser systematiquement par rapport a la phrase avec etre : elle appartient a un ensemble plus vaste, celui des phrases statives. Dans la deuxieme partie, nous avons propose une etude detaillee des phrases averbales a deux termes, tout d'abord des phrases nominales (pronominales) attributives et ensuite des phrases prepositionnelles et adverbiales locatives.

"Abstract Post-colonial interactions between indigenous groups in Amazonia have intrigued observers since contact was established between non-indigenous Brazilians and first-nation peoples. Exchanges between different ethnic groups were largely referred to en passant or in an anecdotal manner. Yet an expanding literature dealing with the dynamics of interethnic contact can now help assess the historical precedents and sociolinguistic features between different indigenous communities. In this article we explore the contact history of the Awá-Guajá of eastern Amazonia, and the sociolinguistic variation that developed between their different communities and neighboring indigenous groups. The Awá-Guajá came into permanent contact with Brazilian mainstream society in 1973 and were settled into four communities by Brazil’s Indian Service. They are Tupí-Guaraní speakers and can converse with other members of this language family, namely, the Ka’apor and Tenetehara. This interaction reveals linguistic affinities and a distinct historical engagement between these groups. Loan words and dialects developed from these relationships, and each group was also influenced by the enveloping machinations of mainstream society. The Awá-Guajá defer to the Ka’apor and Tenetehara yet keep a guarded distance from them, exposing an interesting dynamic that remits us to power relations, historical ecology, and the looming influence of the Brazilian state.",0,1
"Comprehension substantially benefits from attending to, thinking about, and mentally representing the sources of any presented information. Such processes require mental effort and unfortunately people do not always engage in such activities. The current article presents a nascent, evolving model of discourse comprehension that formalizes mechanisms to predict and explain people’s strategic use of source information. The discrepancy-induced source comprehension (D-ISC) model and its theoretical assumptions describe the moment-by-moment cognitive processes in which readers engage when they interact with potentially contradictory or controversial messages presented by different information sources. The utility of the model is supported by evidence from a growing research base examining single- and multiple-text comprehension experiences. The D-ISC model is also useful for suggesting future directions that could help build more-nuanced understandings of the ways that diverse readers engage in sourcing activities within everyday discourse contexts.",0,1
"Rancheros are presented as a distinct subgroup of Mexican campesinos ‘peasants’ who enact a liberal individualist ideology that centrally values private property, especially land, and hard work as the legitimate route to el progreso ‘progress’. Both male and female rancheros are tough and independent “ranch” people who construct their identities in contrast to indigenas ‘Indians’ on the one hand (whom rancheros view as communally-oriented), and catrines ‘city people’ (whom rancheros see as fancily-dressed, and acting, “dandies”) on the other. A history of frontier isolation and mobility in la sociedad ranchera ‘ranchero society’ facilitated the development of both autonomy and strong ties of reciprocity for mutual support in hostile conditions, as well as common ways of living, dressing, and speaking. This valuing of both autonomy and affiliation undermines the often-invoked dichotomy between “Mexicans” and “North Americans” as being communal, or group-oriented, and individualistic, or self-oriented, respectively. Rather than predominantly one or the other, rancheros value both autonomy and affiliation. This historically constructed identity is enacted in a particular way of speaking, franqueza ‘frankness’, direct, straightforward, candid language that goes directly to a point. Informal verbal performances by members of these families within their homes, both in Chicago and Mexico, are analyzed for their construction of ranchero identity through franqueza .",0,1

"This article examines constructions involving DP-final demonstratives, possessive adjectives, indefinite quantifiers, and demonstrative reinforcers in several Romance languages. Across these languages the DP-final position of these elements yields a focus interpretation, whereas the prenominal position yields a neutral interpretation. Other approaches to these sorts of facts have (tacitly) treated the two available word orders as equivalent constructions. They have not considered, and so cannot easily account for, the distinct interpretation that each of the word orders yields. Under the assumption that the prenominal position of these elements is basic, the current approach develops the idea that the DP-final element is “stranded” DP finally as a result of the leftward movement of a syntactic phrase consisting of an extended NP. The facts examined here recall those characterizing the expression of focus in the Romance clause, recently analyzed as a case of scrambling (Ordóñez 1997, Zubizarreta 1998). If on the right track, the current analysis therefore provides further evidence for the parallelism between noun phrases and clauses. In certain Romance languages, an intermediate (postnominal) position is also available for these DP elements , although the interpretation associated with this position does not exactly match that of either the prenominal or DP-final position. It is proposed that the intermediate position is derived by crossing the noun over the demonstrative (reinforcer), possessive, or indefinite quantifier, whose base positions within DP are relatively high. The prediction then is that only those languages with robust noun movement (that is, movement to a relatively high functional head) will exhibit this word order.",0,1
"Predication is widely considered to be a fundamental feature of human language and conceptual structure. This article offers a reassessment of the central role that predication plays within current theories of grammar, by calling into question the universality of predication and its nature as a primitive, irreducible notion.

"Even though ASL isnt as easy to learn as it may seem at first, more and more students are enrolling in ASL courses at both the secondary and university levels and choosing ASL as a primary area of study. For this reason the demand for ASL teachers is increasing, and the need for ASL teacher-preparation programs (ASL TPPs) has increased. Therefore, to assess present and future standards, an examination of the current ASL TPPs in the United States was called for. This article compares three ASL TPPs and examines them for compliance with national teaching standards. The analysis of each site highlights four areas: (a) the program, (b) curriculum development, (c) admission and enrollment requirements, and (d) the courses. Following the curricular narratives of these schools is a comparison of their programs with the trends in national standards. The article ends with some recommendations for upgrading the existing and new ASL TPPs.",0,1

"The new concept of heroism, created in the Soviet world in the 1930s, relied heavily on Arctic theme. The plots that make up the domestic Arctic epos are well known. There isn’t full-fledged narrative about the polar heroine among them, although a request for its appearance was formed at a certain period in Soviet culture, and even attempts to create it were made. This lacuna deserves to attract the research interest. The Arctic discourse of the 1920–1930s. largely anticipated the space theme of the 1960s; the absence in the pantheon of the Soviet conquerors of the Arctic “polar Tereshkova” has a certain meaning. In fact, European women in the Soviet Arctic appeared from the beginning of the 1920s. As a rule, these were wives who supported their husbands- explorers and remained in their shadow. In the literature canonizing polar heroes these women are not often mentioned, and their rare stories are noticeably tailored to the plot of the wives of the Decembrists. Nina Demme, “the world’s first woman – polar explorer”, as Soviet media called her, tried to create a completely different story about herself. Demme sought not only to compete with men on an equal footing in the Arctic world, but also to prove her own – female – superiority. However, the legend did not work out. The article discusses the attempt to canonize the woman – polar explorer and the reasons for its failure.",0,1
"In a representative democracy, some decide in the name of the rest. These elected officials are commonly gathered in public assemblies, such as parliaments, where they discuss policies, legislate, and vote on fundamental initiatives. A core aspect of such democratic processes are the plenary debates, where important public discussions take place. Many parliaments around the world are increasingly keeping the transcripts of such debates and other parliamentary data in digital formats that are accessible to the public. This is meant to increase transparency and accountability, but these records are often only provided as raw text or even as images, with little, if any, annotation and in inconsistent formats, making them difficult to analyse.

"1. OVERVIEW OF A THEORY OF AGREEMENT. Any treatment of morphosyntactic agreement must face those aberrant cases of HYBRID or MIXED agreement. In certain situations for example a noun triggers one set of agreement features on adjectives but the NP headed by that noun triggers a different set of agreement features on verbs or coreferential pronouns; or a noun triggers masculine features on adjectives and pronouns but belongs to the declension class normally reserved for feminine nouns, and so on. These exceptional cases also shed light on regular agreement processes. We present a theory of agreement and apply it to Serbo-Croatian, which, like its Slavic relatives, is richly endowed with regular and hybrid agreement. The mixed agreement patterns that are predicted by the theory, and no others, are attested in that language. Our theory may be summarized as follows. An inflected noun has two different feature sets that determine the agreement values it triggers: CONCORD features (case, number, and gender, for Serbo-Croatian); and the person, number, and gender features of the REFERENTIAL INDEX (Pollard & Sag 1994).1 The concord feature of gender for a given noun is closely related to that noun's declension class, as schematized in 1.",0,1

So much renewed emphasis in print brings to mind the experience of the United States Government Printing Office with a simplified spelling list of 300 common words spelled in two or more ways, and with simplified spelling generally. This experience is recited here for whatever value it may have historically, without the slightest inclination to enter into a consideration of the merits of simplified orthography. On August 27, 1906, President Theodore Roosevelt addressed a letter to the Public Printer, Charles A. Stillings, ordering that thereafter he 'direct that in all Government publications of the Executive Departments the 300 words enumerated in circular No. 51 shall be spelled as therein set forth.' The President justified his order by citing some of the arguments advanced in several circulars2 issued by the Simplified Spelling Board. He also stated:",0,1

"Previous research on the acquisition of noun classification systems (e.g. grammatical gender) has found that child learners rely disproportionately on phonological cues to determine the class of a new noun, even when competing semantic cues are more reliable in their language. Culbertson, gagliardi, and Smith (2017) use artificial language learning experiments with adults to argue that this likely results from the early availability of phonological information during acquisition. Learners base their initial representations on formal features of nouns, only later integrating semantic cues from noun meanings. Here, we use these same methods to show that early availability affects cue use in children (six- to seven-year-olds) as well. However, we also find evidence of developmental changes in sensitivity to semantics; when both cue types are simultaneously available, children are more likely to rely on phonology than adults are. our results suggest that both early availability and a bias favoring phonological cues contribute to children’s overreliance on phonology in natural language acquisition.*",0,1

"The paper describes the linear placement of Serbian clitics syntactically depending on an infinitive in the role of verbal, nominal, or adjectival complement (for short, infinitive clitics). Two linear placement options are in principle available for the infinitive clitics: local placement (in the second linear position [2P] of the infinitive phrase, where they form a cluster of their own) and clause-level placement (in the 2P of the clause, where they join clause-level clitics). Syntactic and prosodic conditions licensing these placement options are discussed and the corresponding clitic linearization rules proposed within a Meaning-Text dependency-based approach to syntax (Mel′čuk 1988, 2013; Polguère and Mel′čuk 2009). It is shown that clause-level placement of 2P clitics (unlike that of ad-verbal clitics of the Romance type) does not require the change of the syntactic governor of the clitics and should therefore be set apart from genuine clitic climbing. This is why the corresponding phenomenon is termed ""clitic pseudo-climbing"".",0,1

We described features of Chilean interpersonal arguing among university students, compared those results with others obtained in the United States, and also compared the associations among variables from country to country. Chilean men displayed more aggressive and self-oriented arguing profiles than Chilean women. Compared to U.S. Americans, Chileans were more motivated to argue and saw the practice of arguing as more cooperative and civil. Many results and correlational patterns were recognizable from one nation to the other, but some differences deserve notice. For example, several measures that are routinely seen as opposites in the U.S. (e.g., impulses to approach or avoid arguing) have only modest negative correlations in the Chilean data.",0,1

"I want to thank the ACL for the Lifetime Achievement Award of 2016. I am deeply honored, and I share this honor with the outstanding collaborators and students I have been lucky to have over my lifetime.The title of my talk describes two fields of linguistics, which differ in their approaches to data and analysis and in their fundamental concepts. What I call the garden is traditional linguistics, including generative grammar. In the garden linguists primarily analyze what I call “cultivated” data—that is, data elicited or introspected by the linguist—and form qualitative generalizations expressed in symbolic representations such as syntactic trees and prosodic phrases. What I am calling the bush could also be called “the wilderness.” In the bush they collect “wild data,” spontaneously produced by speakers, and form quantitative generalizations based on concepts such as conditional probability and information content.• The garden:– qualitative generalizations– cultivated data– syntactic trees, prosodic phrases• The bush:– quantitative generalizations– wild data– conditional probability, information contentMy talk will recount the path I have taken from the linguistic garden into the bush.I came into linguistics with a bachelor's degree in philosophy from Reed College, and after a couple of false starts I ended up in grad school at MIT studying formal grammar in the Department of Linguistics and Philosophy with Chomsky and Halle in the heyday of generative grammar. At MIT, Chomsky was my doctoral advisor, and my mentor was Morris Halle, who ran the Department at that time.The exciting goal was to infer the nature of the mind's capacity for language from the structure of human language, viewed as a purely combinatorial set of formal patterns, like the formulas of symbolic logic. It was apparently exciting even to Fred Jelinek as an MIT doctoral student in information theory ten years before me (Jelinek 2009). In his Lifetime Award speech he recounts how as a grad student he attended some of Chomsky's lectures with his wife, got the “crazy notion” that he should switch from information theory to linguistics, and went as far as discussing it with Chomsky when his advisor Fano got wind of it and said he had to complete his Ph.D. in Information Theory. He had no choice. The rest is history.1The MIT epistemology held that the structure of language could not be learned inductively from what we hear; it had to be deduced from innate, universal cognitive structures specific to human language. This approach had methodological advantages for a philosophical linguist: First, a limitless profusion of data in our own minds came from our intuitions about sentences that we had never heard before; second, a sustained and messy relationship to the world of facts and data was not required; and third, (with the proper training) scientific research could conveniently be done from an armchair using introspection.I got my Ph.D. from MIT in 1972 and taught briefly at Stanford and at UMass, Amherst, before joining the MIT faculty in 1975 as an Associate Professor of Linguistics. Very early on in my career as a linguist I had become aware of discrepancies between the MIT transformational grammar models and the findings of psycholinguists. For example, the theory that more highly transformed syntactic structures would require more complex processing during language comprehension and development did not work.With a year off on a Guggenheim fellowship (1975–1976), I began to think about designing a more psychologically realistic system of transformational grammar that made much less use of syntactic transformations in favor of an enriched lexicon and pragmatics. The occasion was a 1975 symposium jointly sponsored by MIT and AT&T to assess the past and future impact of telecommunications technology on society, in celebration of the centennial of the invention of the telephone. What did I know about any of this? Absolutely nothing. I was invited to participate by Morris Halle. From Harvard Psychology, George Miller invited Eric Wanner, Mike Maratsos, and Ron Kaplan.Ron Kaplan and I developed our common interests in relating formal grammar to computational psycholinguistics, and we began to collaborate. In 1977 we each taught courses at the IV International Summer School in Computational and Mathematical Linguistics, organized by Antonio Zampoli at the Scuola Normale Superiore, Pisa. In 1978 Kaplan visited MIT and we taught a joint graduate course in computational psycholinguistics. From 1978 to 1983, I consulted at the Computer Science Laboratory, Xerox Corporation Palo Alto Research Center (1978–1980) and the Cognitive and Instructional Sciences Group, Xerox PARC (1981–1983).During the 1978 fall semester at MIT we developed the LFG formalism (Kaplan and Bresnan 1982; Dalrymple et al., 1995). Lexical-functional grammar was a hybrid of augmented recursive transition networks (Woods 1970; Kaplan 1972)—used for computational psycholinguistic modeling of relative clause comprehension (Wanner and Maratsos 1978)—and my “realistic” transformational grammars, which offloaded a huge amount of grammatical encoding from syntactic transformations to the lexicon and pragmatics (Bresnan 1978) (see Figure 1).As often noted, the lfg functional structures can be directly mapped to dependency graphs (Mel'cuk 1988; Carroll, Briscoe, and Sanfilippo 1998; King et al. 2003; Sagae, MacWhinney, and Lavie 2004; de Marneffe and Manning 2008) (see Figure 2). Some early statistical NLP parsers such as the Stanford Parser were dual-structure models like lfg with dependency graphs labeled by grammatical functions replacing lfg f-structures (de Marneffe and Manning 2008).A key idea in lfg is that both active and passive argument structures are lexically stored (or created by bounded lexical rules) (see Figure 3). Independent evidence for lexical storage is that passive verbs undergo lexical rules of word-formation (Bresnan 1982b; Bresnan et al. 2015); surface features of passive subj(ects) are retained (e.g., in tag questions). All relation-changing transformations are re-analyzed lexically in this way: passive, dative, raising, there-insertion, etc., etc.Figure 4 shows how the lexical features of active and passive terminal strings are mapped into the appropriate predicate–argument relations. The respective subjects of the upper and lower c-structure trees are first and third person singular pronouns, which give rise to the f-structures indexed i. The lexical forms are, respectively, active and passive, mapping each subject f-structure to the appropriate argument role of the verb hit.We soon involved a highly productive group of young researchers in linguistics and psychology (initially represented in Bresnan, 1982a). The original group included Steve Pinker as a young postdoc from Harvard, Marilyn Ford as an MIT postdoc from Australia, Jane Grimshaw then teaching at Brandeis, and doctoral students at MIT and Harvard: Lori Levin, K. P. Mohanan, Carol Neidle, Avery Andrews, and Annie Zaenen.lfg's declarative, non-procedural design made it easily embeddable in what we then considered more realistic theories of the dynamics of sentence production (Ford 1982), comprehension (Ford, Bresnan, and Kaplan 1982; Ford 1983), and language development (Pinker 1984).In 1982 I took a sabbatical leave from MIT at the Center for the Study of Behavioral Sciences at Stanford, where I also spent time at Xerox PARC nearby.At Stanford, the Center for the Study of Language and Information (CSLI) was being launched with a grant from the System Development Corporation. I decided to stay in California by joining the Stanford Linguistics Department and CSLI the following year, half-time. From 1983–1992, I worked the other half of my time as a member of the Research Staff, Intelligent Systems Laboratory, Xerox Corporation Palo Alto Research Center, which John Seely Brown headed during that time. lfg was considered useful in some computational linguistics applications such as MT.In 1984 a Malaŵian linguist on a Fulbright Fellowship came to Stanford as a visitor. I had corresponded with him a few years earlier when I was a young faculty member at MIT and he had received his Ph.D. from the University of London. We both had lexical syntactic inclinations, and he had evidence from the Bantu language Chicheŵa, one of the major languages of Malaŵi. His name was Sam Mchombo.Sam Mchombo arrived at Stanford just as CSLI was forming, and we began to collaborate on the problems of analyzing the (sooo cool) linguistic properties of Chicheŵa in the lfg framework: Chicheŵa has 18 genders (but not masculine/feminine), tone morphemes, pronouns incorporated into verb morphology, relation changes all expressed by verb stem suffixation (which undergo derivational morphology), configurational discourse functions, …!One of Sam's ideas was that the Chicheŵa object marker, prefixed to the verb stem, functions syntactically as a full-blooded object pronoun. In lfg, the formal analysis is simple (see Figure 5). The analysis has rich empirical motivation in phonology, morphology, syntax, discourse, and language change (Bresnan and Mchombo 1987, 1995). Similar analyses have been explored in many disparate languages (e.g., Austin and Bresnan 1996; Bresnan et al. 2015). This and other work by many colleagues and students on a wide variety of languages helped to establish lfg as a flexible and well-developed linguistic theory useful to typologists and field linguists.I wrote National Science Foundation grant proposals for successive projects with Sam and other Bantuists including Katherine Demuth and Lioba Moshi, and in the summer of 1986 did field work in Tanzania. In Tanzania I took time out to celebrate my birthday by hiking up Mt. Kilimanjaro with a group of young physicians from Europe doing volunteer work in Africa.There I was, out of the armchair and onto the hard-packed dirt floor of a thatched home in a village on the slopes of Mt. Kilimanjaro, being served the eyeball of a freshly slaughtered young goat, which I was told was a particular honor normally reserved for men. … But I was still in the garden of linguistics:• The garden:– qualitative generalizations– cultivated data– syntactic trees, prosodic phrasesTwo intellectual shocks caused me eventually to leave the garden and completely change my research paradigm.The first shock was discovery that universal principles of grammar may be inconsistent and conflict with each other. The expressions of a language are not those that perfectly satisfy a set of true and universal constraints or rules, but are those that may violate some constraints in order to satisfy other more important constraints, optimizing constraint satisfaction. This insight came into linguistics from outside the field, from neural network approaches to cognition (Prince and Smolensky 1997). Yet as my former student Jane Grimshaw pointed out, we can see traces of it everywhere, even in corners of English syntax that had seemed exception-ridden.In response to these ideas, I began in the mid-1990s to work out how to do optimality-theoretic (ot) syntax using lfg as the representational basis (e.g., Bresnan 2000). ot-style constraint ranking in large-scale lfg grammars was adopted in standard lfg parsing systems for ambiguity management (Frank et al. 1998; Kaplan et al. 2004; King et al. 2004). And Jonas Kuhn (2001, 2003) solved general computational problems of generation and parsing for ot syntax with lfg representations.Ranked or weighted contraints on f-structures can capture unusual morphosyntactic generalizations. For example, suppose that the grammatical function hierarchy has to align with the person hierarchy (Aissen 1999):Imposing the person-alignment constraints on f-structures either requires or prohibits passivization, depending on who does what to whom. Compare Example (2) and Figure 6.An event in which the first person hits someone referred to in the third person must be described in the active voice of hit, not the passive, because the passive subject would be higher on the function hierarchy than the non-subj but lower on the person hierarchy, contrary to the aligned hierarchies in Example (1). But if the third person hits the first person, the passive is obligatory, because the active voice sentence would violate the alignment of hierarchies. There are person-driven passives like this in Lummi (Salish, British Columbia), Picurís (Tanoan, New Mexico), and Nootka (Wakashan, British Columbia)—all unrelated languages.My former student Chris Manning (who wrote his Linguistics doctoral dissertation at Stanford under my supervision) joined the Stanford faculty as Assistant Professor of Computer Science and Linguistics in 1999, and I began to attend his lectures and meet with him to discuss research. In studies of English using the Switchboard corpus, we found that English has soft, statistical shadows of hard person constraints in other languages: For example, it has person-driven active/passive alternations (Bresnan, Dingare, and Manning 2001), and person-driven dative alternations (Bresnan and Nikitina 2009). As Bresnan, Dingare, and Manning (2001) observe, “The same categorical phenomena which are attributed to hard grammatical constraints in some languages continue to show up as statistical preferences in other languages, motivating a grammatical model that can account for soft constraints.”Examples of such models include stochastic ot (Bresnan, Deo, and Sharma 2007; Maslova 2007; Bresnan and Nikitina 2009), maximum-entropy ot (Goldwater and Johnson 2003; Gerhard Jaeger 2007), random fields (Johnson and Riezler 2003), data-oriented parsing (Bod and Kaplan 2003; Bod 2006), and other exemplar-based theories of grammar (Hay and Bresnan 2006; Walsh et al. 2010).In addition to Chris Manning, another person who helped me go into the bush was Harald Baayen. I first met Harald while attending a 2003 LSA workshop on Probability Theory in Linguistics. The presenters included Harald, Janet Pierrehumbert (with her student Jen Hay), Chris Manning, and others. As I watched the presenters give graphic visualizations of quantitative data showing dynamic linguistic phenomena, I thought, “I want to do that!”My golden opportunity was the English dative alternation. Many English ditransitive verbs appear in alternative dative constructions, with the recipient realized as a dative PP—a prepositional to-phrase—or as the first of two noun phrases—the dative NP. Spontaneously produced alternations occur:Which of these alternative constructions is used depends on multiple and often conflicting syntactic, informational, and semantic properties.Bresnan et al. (2007) collected and manually annotated 2,360 instances of dative NP or PP constructions from the (unparsed) Switchboard Corpus (Godfrey et al. 1992) and another 905 from the Treebank Wall Street Journal corpus, using the manually parsed Treebank corpora (Marcus et al. 1993) to discover the set of dative verbs. With Harald Baayen's help we fit a series of generalized linear and generalized linear mixed-effect models to the data. I read several books on statistical modeling that Harald recommended to me; I learned R, the programming language and environment for computational statistics (R Core Team 2015), which he also highly recommended (stressing that his name is R. Harald Baayen). Then I was able to show that under bootstrapping of speaker clusters and cross-validation, the models were highly accurate.Figure 7 illustrates a quantitative generalization that emerged from the models: The paired parameter estimates for the recipient and theme have opposite signs. I dubbed this phenomenon quantitative harmonic alignment after the qualitative harmonic alignment in syntax studied by Aissen (1999) and others in the framework of Optimality Theory. Figure 8 provides a qualitative schematic depiction of the quantitative phenomena. The hierarchies of discourse accessibility, animacy, definiteness, pronominality, and weight are aligned with the initial/final syntactic positions of the postverbal arguments across constructions. In lfg, the linear order follows from alignment with the hierarchy of grammatical functions in f-structure (Bresnan and Nikitina 2009).Interestingly, there are hard animacy constraints on dative as well as genitive alternations in some languages (Rosenbach 2005; Bresnan 2007a; Rosenbach 2008), and even hard weight constraints (O'Connor, Maling, and Skarabela 2009). The facts suggest that these constraints play a role in syntactic typology and should not be brushed off as external to grammar and out of bounds to the theoretical linguist.In principle, these quantitative harmonic alignment effects could be formulated as constraints on lfg f-structures. Annie Zaenen saw how this kind of work might be useful for paraphrase analysis to improve generation, and she got us involved with Mark Steedman and colleagues at Edinburgh on an animacy annotation project (Zaenen et al. 2004).The second intellectual shock that pushed me further into the bush was realizing that in the garden, we had been relying all along on inconsistent binary grammaticality judgments that can be manipulated by changing the probabilities of the contexts, and we had vastly underestimated the human language capacity.At the suggestion of Jeff Ellman, I used the dative corpus model to measure the predictive power of English language users (Bresnan 2007b). Inspired by Anette Rosenbach's (2003) beautiful experiment on the genitive alternation, and with her advice, I made questionnaires asking participants to rate the naturalness of contextualized alternative dative constructions sampled from our dative data set, by allocating 100 points between the alternatives (see Figure 9).In one set of task instructions I asked participants to rate the choices in accordance with their own intuitions; in another I asked them to guess what the original speaker actually said in the discourse excerpt, and to rate their confidence in their guess in the same way, splitting 100 points between the alternatives. The findings were similar: As the log odds of a PP dative construction increased, the ratings of each participant showed a linear increase as well. The participants could tell which dative construction the original speaker was going to use, and their own ratings matched the corpus probabilities (see Figure 10). This finding has been replicated across speakers of other varieties of English (Bresnan and Ford 2010).A second experiment reported in Bresnan (2007b) used linguistic manipulations that raise or lower probability to see whether they influence grammaticality judgments. Certain semantic classes of verbs reported by linguists to be ungrammatical in the double object construction are nevertheless found in actual usage (Bresnan et al. 2007). For example, whisper is reported to be ungrammatical in the double object construction, but Internet queries yield whisper me the answer, along with whisper the password to the fat lady. The double object context with the pronoun recipient is more harmonically aligned and far more probable. The reportedly ungrammatical examples constructed by linguists tend to utilize the far less probable positionings of argument types, like whisper the fat lady the answer. In the experiment I found that participants rated the reportedly ungrammatical constructions in the more probable contexts higher than the reportedly grammatical constructions in the less probable contexts.I began to find that throughout the grammar, linguistic reports of ungrammaticality had been greatly exaggerated (Bresnan 2007a). Our linguistic intuitions of what is ungrammatical may merely reflect our implicit knowledge of what is highly improbable (see also Manning 2003).The simplifying assumption in the garden of linguistic theory has been that speakers' knowledge of their language is characterized by a static, categorical system of grammar. Although this has been a fruitful idealization, I came to see that it ultimately underestimates human language capacities. My own research showed that language users can match the probabilities of linguistic features of the environment and they have powerful predictive capabilities that enable them to anticipate the variable linguistic choices of others. Therefore, the working hypothesis I have adopted contrasts strongly with that of the garden: Grammar itself is inherently variable and probabilistic in nature, rather than categorical and algebraic.With collaborators, I began to look for implicit knowledge of syntactic probabilities in various areas of linguistics—in phonetic reflexes of construction frequencies and probabilities (Hay and Bresnan 2006; Tily et al. 2009; Kuperman and Bresnan 2012); in language development (de Marneffe et al. 2012; Van den Bosch and Bresnan 2015); in language change (Wolk et al. 2013; Szmrecsányi et al. 2014); and in comparative syntactic variation across varieties of English (Bresnan and Ford 2010; Ford and Bresnan 2015).My research program is taking me even deeper into the bush, as I will now illustrate with several visualizations of wild data.In (tensed) verb contraction, the verbs is, are, am, has, have, will, would lose all but their final segments, orthographically represented as 's, 're, 'm, 's, 've, 'll, 'd, and form a unit with the immediately preceding word, called the host. In Example (3) the host is bolded:Previous corpus studies point to informativeness (or closely related concepts) as an important predictor of verb contraction (Frank and Jaeger 2008; Bresnan and Spencer 2012; Barth and Kapatsinski 2014). Informativeness derives from predictability: More predictable events are less informative, and can even be redundant (Shannon 1948). The less predictable the host–verb combination, the more informative it is, and the less likely to contract.In a corpus, the information content of a word B given the context C is the average negative log conditional probability of B over all instances of C (Piantadosi, Tily, and Gibson 2011). We define the informativity of a host-verb bigramB as in Equation (5):where B is the bigram consisting of a host and a verb in either contracted or uncontracted form (for example, blood's or blood is), N is the total frequency of B, and nexti is the following context word for the ith occurrence of B in the corpus.Figure 11 shows the strong inverse relation between verb contraction and informativity of host–verb bigrams for the verb is/'s in data from the Canterbury Corpus of New Zealand English (Gordon et al. 2004), which I collected with Jen Hay in the summer and fall of 2015.2 Jen and I discussed implications of the informativity of verb contraction. As vocabulary richness grows, local word combinations become less predictable. Average predictability across contexts is what makes a host–verb combination more or less informative. Hence, increases in vocabulary richness would lead to increased informativity of host–verb combinations, potentially causing dynamic changes in verb contractions over time. These implications led me to ask whether children decrease their use of verb contractions in periods of increasing vocabulary richness during language development—a question never before asked, as far as I could tell from the literature.It was not difficult to answer my question. I had already collected verb contraction data from longitudinal corpora in CHILDES (MacWhinney 2000).3 The CHILDES corpora are an invaluable resource. They have been morphologically analyzed, automatically parsed, and manually checked. As a matter of fact, the syntactic parses use dependency graphs derived from lfg functional structure relations (Sagae, MacWhinney, and Lavie 2004; Sagae, Lavie, and MacWhinney 2005). Computational tools are provided, including the CLAN VOCD tool (MacWhinney 2015), which calculates vocabulary richness based on a sophisticated algorithm for averaging morpheme or lemma counts (lemmas being the distinct words disregarding inflections).I used the VOCD tool to calculate the lemma diversity of all of the language produced by each child at each recording session in the longitudinal corpora we selected. The panel plots in Figure 12 show increasing vocabulary richness as age increases between about 20 and 60 months, with the exception of one child (“Adam”), whose vocabulary richness was already high at the time of sampling and shows a dip midway in the recordings.From the relations among verb contraction, informativity, and vocabulary richness we would expect children's subject–verb contractions to decrease as their vocabulary richness increases. Figure 13 shows that this expectation may be met: Overall, the children's contractions are tending to decrease, and only one child shows an increase in contraction during the period from 20 to 60 months: Adam, the child whose vocabulary richness shows the dip in Figure 12.How do the dynamics of contraction in the children's data compare to their parents' contractions in conversational interactions during the same periods? Presumably the parents themselves would not be experiencing rapid vocabulary growth during this period, so they would not show a decline in verb contractions for that reason. Figure 14 shows the aggregated is contraction data by children vs. parents for all host-is/'s bigrams and for the frequent bigrams what is/'s and Mommy is/'s. Strikingly, the children in the aggregate show declines in the proportion of contractions while their parents' proportions remain constant.These data visualizations appear to support a major cognitive role for implicit knowledge of syntactic probability. But they also raise many, many questions for further research—a good indicator of their potential fertility. This will be the focus of my next research project.I am aware that this use of information theory characterizes just one small prosodic island in English syntax, the contractible host–verb sequence. It does make me wonder whether the entirety of hierarchical syntactic structure could somehow reflect a vast topography of overlapping peaks and valleys of informativeness, requiring parallel computations on multiple scales—something that one of you perhaps could figure out how to do.My work now has essentially the same exciting goal as when I started my study of linguistics at MIT: to infer the nature of the mind's capacity for language from the structure of human language. But now I know that linguistic structure is quantitative as well as qualitative, and I can use methods that I have been learning in the bush —• The bush:– quantitative generalizations– wild data– conditional probability, information contentWhat I hope to see going forward are increasingly powerful applications of computational linguistic theory, techniques, and resources to deepen our understanding of human language and cognition.",0,1
"Paragon and antonomasia share identical constructional devices, namely, proper names that participate in an exchange relation with other entities, or proper names that are modified by various constructional devices, such as definite or indefinite articles, of-phrases, determining adjectives, or epithets. The present paper focuses on two main objectives. The first of these is to unveil the conceptual tools required for the expression of paragon and antonomasia, and determine whether or not these two figures are explained exclusively by means of metaphoric and/or metonymic processes, as has been suggested in previous studies. The second objective is to explore the role of constructional devices that account for instances of paragon and antonomasia. In the present study, it is claimed that proper names modified and enriched by constructional devices activate frames which allow for the emergence of intensified and even hyperbolic interpretations. The difference between the two mechanisms lies in the quality and the function of conceptual frames.",0,1

"Abstract In this paper, the second in the pair, we discuss how psychologists, linguists, and computer scientists model emotion from a computational perspective. First, we draw some parallels between the formalization of the emotions in the human body and the development of computational systems. Then we look at three influential schools for formalizing emotion in language, and we use a specific example to show that they do not have the same concerns and expressive power. We give some examples of computational resources for emotions, insisting on why the variety of languages and cultures makes it impossible to apply a monolithic universal approach. We then turn to emotion and opinion and briefly overview opinion mining and emotion generation. Instead of describing techniques and technologies and providing quantitative results, we try to present a “big picture” of emotion processing.",0,1
"Macaulay and Brice (1997:798) surveyed example sentences in eleven syntax textbooks published from 1969–1994 and found that virtually all of the authors 'favor male-gendered NPs as subjects and agents, and regularly stereotype both genders'. In this article, we address the question of whether constructed example sentences in more recent textbooks show similar gender bias. We present an analysis of six syntax textbooks published from 2005–2017, from which we randomly sampled 200 example sentences each. We find that the gender skew and stereotypes reported in 1997 are still present today. Male-gendered arguments are almost twice as frequent as female-gendered ones, and more likely to occur as subjects and agents. In addition, example sentences often perpetuate gender stereotypes. We discuss some broader implications and potential interventions to prevent the implicit perpetuation of gender biases in linguistic materials.",0,1

Bei der Aufarbeitung der Geschichte wird fur alle vier Lander die Rolle der Aktion Suhnezeichen, der jeweiligen Schulbuchkommission sowie der Deutschen Historischen Institute bzw. ihrer Entsprechungen hervorgehoben. Gleichzeitig wird jedoch dahingehend differenziert, dass etwa die Unterschiede in der Entschadigungspolitik gegenuber Israel und Frankreich einerseits und den bis 1989 kommunistisch regierten Staaten Polen und Tschechoslowakei andererseits klar hervortreten. Auch der unterschiedliche Umgang mit dem Thema Vertreibung in Polen und der Tschechischen Republik wird deutlich oder gelegentlich das Verhaltnis zu Russland und auch den USA als Ursache fur Differenzen zwischen Deutschland einerseits und Polen und der Tschechischen Republik andererseits. Die Arbeit beruht auf der Auswertung unzahliger Regierungsdokumente, Erklarungen, Reden, Interviews etc., einer umfangreichen Sekundarliteratur sowie etlichen Dutzend Interviews mit zivilgesellschaftlichen Akteuren und Experten. Die Fulle des Materials wird in mehreren tabellarischen Ubersichten sowie in einem sich uber 16 Seiten erstreckenden Zeitstrahl zusammengefasst, der die staatlichen wie die gesellschaftlichen Beziehungen der Bundesrepublik zu den vier Staaten von 1949 bis 2009 ubersichtlich prasentiert. Sehr gut belegt wird dabei die in der Arbeit vielfach vertretene These, die Beziehungen mit Frankreich seien auch auf der institutionellen Ebene am ausgepragtesten gewesen, gefolgt von Israel und Polen, wahrend trotz einzelner Vorlaufer das Verhaltnis zur Tschechoslowakei bzw. der Tschechischen Republik erst ab 1989 ausgebaut worden sei (und weiter „ausbaufahig“ bleibe). Was bei der umfassenden Analyse vielleicht etwas zu kurz kommt, ist die Bedeutung der strafrechtlichen Verfolgung von Tatern fur die Versohnung. Da die Justiz in den ersten Jahrzehnten der Bundesrepublik „auf dem rechten Auge“ (gegenuber NSund Kriegsverbrechern) haufig blind gewesen ist, konnten, zumindest was die Wirkung ihres Verhaltens betrifft, durchaus auch Teile der Justiz zu den in einigen Unterkapiteln behandelten Gegnern der Versohnung gerechnet werden, auch wenn Organe der Rechtsprechung nicht zu den unmittelbaren ausenpolitischen Akteuren zahlten. Knapp gestreift wird im Schlusskapitel der ganz anders geartete Umgang Japans mit seiner belasteten Vergangenheit. Die neunmonatige Regierungszeit von Yukio Hatoyama 2009/10 zeigte eine gewisse vergangenheitspolitische Offnung, blieb aber ohne politische Folgewirkungen. Auch in Japan liesen sich – freilich spater und weit schwacher als in Deutschland – zivilgesellschaftliche Initiativen beobachten, die der Politik den Weg zu einem vertrauensvollen Verhaltnis zu den Nachbarn zu ebnen versuchten.

"Abstract Cochlear implant (CI) users have been shown to be more susceptible to the variations in speech production encountered in everyday listening, in which speaking rate, amplitude, duration, and voice pitch information may be quite variable, depending on the production context. Such variations may be further enlarged by the background noise, especially dynamic noise. The limited spectral resolution provided by the CI limits perception of voice pitch, which is an important cue for speech prosody and for tonal languages such as Mandarin Chinese. In this study, the effect of varying speaking rates and styles and background noise on speech understanding was investigated in Mandarin-speaking CI and normal-hearing (NH) listeners. Thirteen (5 male and 8 female, age 19–62 years) Mandarin-speaking, post-lingually deafened adult CI patients using their clinical processors and 9 (5 male and 4 female, age 23–59 years) NH subjects listening to unprocessed speech. Five different types of speech variations, including 3 speaking rates (slow, normal, fast) and 2 speaking styles (emotional, shouted) were presented with two masking noises (speech-shaped steady state noise-SSN or six-talker babble). Speech reception threshold, defined as the signal-to-noise ratio producing 50% correct word-in-sentence recognition using Mandarin Speech Perception materials was measured. NH listeners performed significantly better (16.7 dB) than CI patients across all conditions regardless of speech variations and noise types. CI patients’ performance deficit was highly dependent on speech rate and noise type; the deficit was smallest (11.7 dB) when slowly-spoken speech was presented in SSN and largest (20.6 dB) when shouted speech was presented in six-talker speech babble. NH listeners performed significantly better in speech babble than in SSN for all speech variations, while CI patients performed similarly in both noise types. The use of clear and slowly-spoken speech in the laboratory setting may largely underestimate CI patients’ performance deficits in real-world listening conditions, where acoustic variations introduced by speech variations and dynamic noise may present additional challenges.",0,1
"This article proposes that the possible word orders for any natural language construction composed of n elements, each of which selects for the category headed by the next, are universally limited both across and within languages to a subclass of permutations on the ‘universal order of command’ 1, …, n, as determined by their selectional restrictions. The permitted subclass is known as the ‘separable’ permutations, and grows in n as the large Schröder series {1, 2, 6, 22, 90, 394, 1806, … }. This universal is identified as formal because it follows directly from the assumptions of combinatory categorial grammar (CCG)—in particular, from the fact that all CCG syntactic rules are subject to a combinatory projection principle that limits them to binary rules applying to contiguous nonempty categories.",0,1

"The study presented here examines how adult L2 listeners’ L1 phonotactics interferes with L2 vowel perception in different consonantal contexts. We examined Mandarin listeners’ perception of the English /ei/-/iː/ vowel contrast in three onset consonantal contexts, /p f w/, which represent different phonotactic scenarios with respect to the permissibility of Mandarin phonology. L1 Mandarin listeners (N = 42) completed a series of three tasks: a categorisation task, a vowel identification task, and an AXB discrimination task. The results show that English /ei/-/iː/ are perceived as highly contrastive in the /p/ context because both /pei/ and /piː/ constitute a licit sequence in Mandarin phonology. However, participants experience substantial /ei/-/iː/ category confusion in the /f/ and /w/ contexts, where Mandarin listeners repair perceptually by modifying the vowel quality in illicit (unattested) consonant–vowel sequences, i.e., */fiː/ → /fei/ and */wiː/ → /wei/. Further exploratory analyses indicate that L2 listeners’ vowel perception in unfamiliar phonotactic contexts is associated with their target language experience, typically indicated by their L2 vocabulary size. The findings thus suggest that the acquisition of novel phonotactic regularities is tied to increased experience with the L2 lexicon.",0,1
"This article studies the use of linguistic resources to construct an ""imagined community"" in a Chinese gay and lesbian magazine. Four groups of linguistic resources are examined: terminology from gay and lesbian cultures in the West, the women's movement, Chinese revolutionist discourse, and the Chinese kinship system. We show that the producers of the magazine draw on resources from various discourses, but they do not adopt them in their entirety. These resources are reworked and combined to construct an imagined Chinese gay community with its own distinctive style. We argue that to understand how social meanings are expressed through style and how style makes one community distinct from another, it is essential to examine a broad range of symbolic resources that are appropriated and combined by individuals or groups. This process of ""bricolage"" also underscores the agency of language users and the dynamic nature of linguistic practice. In constituting a new discourse of resistance and negotiating community boundaries, language users as social agents act on preexisting linguistic symbols and give them new meanings. Finally, we suggest that, although ideology mediates the manner in which linguistic resources are used, it is also reproduced through language use.",0,1

"Georgian is a Kartvelian (South Caucasian) language spoken by 4 to 5 million people in the Republic of Georgia, with small diaspora communities spread out in a few republics of the former Soviet Union, Iran, and Turkey. Shanidze (1973) distinguishes six groups of Georgian dialects: Dasavluri (Imeruli, Guruli, Rachuli, Lechkhumuri); Ingilouri; Kartlur-Kakhuri (Kartluri, Kakhuri, Javakhuri, Meskhuri, Kizikuri); Mtiulur-Pshauri (Mtiulur-Gudamakruli, Pshauri); Pkhouri (Khevsuruli, Mokheuri, Tushuri); and Samkhret-Dasavluri (Acharuli, Imerkheuli). The Kartluri dialect is considered the basis of standard or literary Georgian. It is spoken in Kartli, an eastern Georgian province where Tbilisi, the Georgian capital, is located. Standard literary Georgian is discussed here. One male speaker from Tbilisi (the second author) was consulted for all the data presented in the illustration.",0,1
"The last decade has seen an explosion in the number of people learning English as a second language (ESL). In China alone, it is estimated to be over 300 million (Yang in Engl Today 22, 2006). Even in predominantly English-speaking countries, the proportion of non-native speakers can be very substantial. For example, the US National Center for Educational Statistics reported that nearly 10 % of the students in the US public school population speak a language other than English and have limited English proficiency (National Center for Educational Statistics (NCES) in Public school student counts, staff, and graduate counts by state: school year 2000–2001, 2002). As a result, the last few years have seen a rapid increase in the development of NLP tools to detect and correct grammatical errors so that appropriate feedback can be given to ESL writers, a large and growing segment of the world’s population. As a byproduct of this surge in interest, there have been many NLP research papers on the topic, a Synthesis Series book (Leacock et al. in Automated grammatical error detection for language learners. Synthesis lectures on human language technologies. Morgan Claypool, Waterloo 2010), a recurring workshop (Tetreault et al. in Proceedings of the NAACL workshop on innovative use of NLP for building educational applications (BEA), 2012), and a shared task competition (Dale et al. in Proceedings of the seventh workshop on building educational applications using NLP (BEA), pp 54–62, 2012; Dale and Kilgarriff in Proceedings of the European workshop on natural language generation (ENLG), pp 242–249, 2011). Despite this growing body of work, several issues affecting the annotation for and evaluation of ESL error detection systems have received little attention. In this paper, we describe these issues in detail and present our research on alleviating their effects.",0,1

"Abstract This article looks at constructions involving optional movement of contrastive foci and argues that this type of reordering cannot be accounted for by assuming that it is driven by a syntactic feature. I maintain that an interface‐based approach that rests on the principles of economy fares better at capturing the data, as it accounts not only for optionality of contrastive‐focus movement, which is found in a wide variety of languages, but also for multiple landing sites for contrastive‐focus movement, which are found in scrambling languages, such as Russian.",0,1
"Web searchers reformulate their queries, as they adapt to search engine behavior, learn more about a topic, or simply correct typing errors. Automatic query rewriting can help user web search, by augmenting a user’s query, or replacing the query with one likely to retrieve better results. One example of query-rewriting is spell-correction. We may also be interested in changing words to synonyms or other related terms. For Japanese, the opportunities for improving results are greater than for languages with a single character set, since documents may be written in multiple character sets, and a user may express the same meaning using different character sets. We give a description of the characteristics of Japanese search query logs and manual query reformulations carried out by Japanese web searchers. We use characteristics of Japanese query reformulations to extend previous work on automatic query rewriting in English, taking into account the Japanese writing system. We introduce several new features for building models resulting from this difference and discuss their impact on automatic query rewriting. We also examine enhancements in the form of rules which block conversion between some character sets, to address Japanese homophones. The precision/recall curves show significant improvement with the new feature set and blocking rules, and are often better than the English counterpart.",0,1
"Abstract ‘Syntactic microvariation’ and ‘microcomparative syntax’ are the terms for a fairly new research approach that applies the theoretical concepts and techniques of modern generative theory to dialectal and other small‐scale variational data. Traditional studies in dialectology aim at a detailed and fine‐grained description of language variants; the ultimate goal being a proper classification of the dialects, their exact areal distribution as well as their historical/diachronic development. For formal generative theory on the other hand, the foremost goal is to model the human language faculty with Universal Grammar as a theory about possible human languages (and how they can be acquired). Microcomparative syntax tries to reconcile these two research traditions by applying the formal theoretical concepts of generative grammar to those ‘minor’, ‘peripheral’, and sometimes kind of ‘squishy’ differences between closely related language variants as they are typically found in dialectal data. Research in microvariation tries to offer new concepts that can account for the range and (limits) of inter‐ and intra‐speaker variation in a principled way while at the same time testing existing formal theories against these microvariational data and thus contributing to the theory of language variation. A profound understanding of microvariation will also open a way to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of language change, given that language change necessarily preconditions variability in the data.",0,1
"This paper introduces a semantics-aware approach to natural language inference which allows neural network models to perform better on natural language inference benchmarks. We propose to incorporate explicit lexical and concept-level semantics from knowledge bases to improve inference accuracy. We conduct an extensive evaluation of four models using different sentence encoders, including continuous bag-of-words, convolutional neural network, recurrent neural network, and the transformer model. Experimental results demonstrate that semantics-aware neural models give better accuracy than those without semantics information. On average of the three strong models, our semantic-aware approach improves natural language inference in different languages.",0,1

"Ultrasound imaging is becoming a practical tool in silent speech recognition. It is a challenge to accurately extract tongue contours due to the soft tissue characteristics of the tongue and the high level of speckle noise in ultrasound images. Based on the U-Net network, an improved network called wUnet is proposed to extract the contour of the ultrasonic tongue. First, upward interlevel jump connections are added to the coding network to extract sufficient tongue contour features at different levels to learn more coarse-grained information. Second, downward interlevel jump connections are added to the decoding network to have richer fine-grained semantics and more obvious image reconstruction effects in the information fusion stage. Finally, VGG16 convolutional blocks with a different number of layers are added between the two interlevel connections, and an end-to-end multilevel context encoder is jointly trained. The binary-cross entropy, IoU, and Dice coefficients are fused to form a composite function to calculate the network loss, which accelerates the process of determining the contour boundary. Extensive experiments on the NS, TJU, and TIMIT datasets show that the proposed approach yields a better extraction result on ultrasonic tongue contour than the baseline models.",0,1

This article contributes to the body of research on reported thought by adding the shift of first-person pronouns as one of the initial linguistic cues indicating the shift of current talk to reported thought in Korean conversation.",0,1

How could a trip which cost her R15 cost a tourist R300? Eventually a taxi operator called in to cut through all the nonsense. It was about misunderstanding the difference between a taxi and a minibus taxi. Using the former means that you pay per kilometre, irrespective of the number of people who get into the taxi, to a destination you decide. Using the latter implies that you pay a fixed cost per person and the drop-off points are predetermined for you along a specific route. And there is little difference in cost for the trip if the minibus taxi were carrying 20 people.",0,1

"We carried out a systematic review of psycholinguistic, empirical, quantitative studies on verbal irony use and individual differences (i.e. psychological, not demographic, traits that significantly differentiate individuals). Out of 5,967 publications screened, 29, comprising 35 studies in total, were included. Following a qualitative content analysis, six thematic clusters were identified, representing areas of research in individual differences in irony use: (a) psychological well-being, (b) personality traits, (c) humor-related traits, (d) cultural factors, (e) social skills, and (f) cognitive factors. The results of the studies in each cluster are summarized and conclusions for further research are presented. In particular, the systematic review suggests that irony and sarcasm should be clearly delineated as separate, yet related phenomena due to differing patterns of correlations with specific individual differences. Additionally, significant methodological heterogeneity between the studies suggests the need for greater standardization of irony use measures.",0,1

"Abstract In this paper, which discusses data from Gargano Apulian Italo‐Romance, I propose that prepositional and non‐prepositional genitives are fundamentally two different types of phrases, and that the interpretation of a non‐prepositional noun as the possessor is not due to a silent preposition or head‐modifier inversion, but rather to an agreement mechanism taking place between the modifier and its head. We propose that, just as a genitive can agree with its head for gender and number features so it can for definiteness, and that agreement for definiteness yields a genitival interpretation of the non‐prepositional noun. I.e., definiteness can externalize the syntactic relation between head and modifier. We also propose that in this Apulian variety, non‐prepositional genitives are syntactic phases (Chomsky 2001), and that the same holds for non‐prepositional ‘qualitative’ predicative phrases in the same language. This would explain the impossibility of accessing the phrase through syntactic operations such as extraction.",0,1

"Abstract The study examined the effects of fixed criteria, training and moderation on reliability of ratings assigned to written scripts. Using an item response analysis, consistency of inter and intra rater reliability of scoring patterns were examined under changing conditions. Ratings were assigned twice under workshop conditions and once under unsupervised isolated conditions. The workshops were used to identify criteria used by raters and then to obtain an agreed set of criteria using a consensus moderation approach. Results indicate that raters are influenced by their backgrounds, the moderation procedure and by the criteria depending on the circumstances under which the ratings were assigned. However a lack of fit of the ratings to a single dimension model over time, suggests that the raters may change their criteria under different conditions. Although similar ratings may be assigned, different criteria are employed by the same rater over time. The results seriously question the use of classical measurement approaches in the assessment of rater reliability.",0,1

Tom McArthur's contribution to English language studies has been immense, and has had a powerful impact at a number of levels. Tom started his life as an educator, gaining crucial exposure to English across the globe very early in his career, when in one of his first jobs teaching English at the Cathedral School in Bombay (Mumbai). After a varied academic career, which included a post at the University of Quebec, Tom returned to the UK to start a new journal for Cambridge University Press, English Today .

"Verb Classification in Mayrinax Atayal1 Lillian M. Huang Abstract Verb classes are examined in Mayrinax Atayal, an Austronesian language spoken in Taiwan, based on certain semantic, morphological, and syntactic properties. Focus markers; negative, imperative, and causative constructions; the tense/aspect/mood system of the language; and a dimension of greater-lesser dynamicity (or stativity) are all investigated. The primary distinction between dynamic and stative verbs is supported by the different behaviors of verbs in the various constructions. Because degrees of dynamicity/stativity of Mayrinax verbs are relative rather than absolute, a continuum is proposed with dynamic verbs and stative verbs appearing at the two extremes. 1. Introduction. Atayal is one of the more widespread of the Formosan languages, ranging from Ilan Prefecture in the northeast of Taiwan to Taipei and Taoyuan Prefectures in the north, and southward through Hsinchu, Miaoli, and Tai-chung Prefectures to Nantou in the central portion of the island. It consists of two major subgroups, namely, Squliq and Cʔuliʔ, the latter of which is considered as being more conservative. The dialectal variant examined in this paper is that of Mayrinax, a Cʔuliʔ dialect spoken in Chinshui Village, Taian Hsiang, Miaoli Prefecture. Of all Formosan languages and dialects, Mayrinax is one of the only two known dialects that show certain distinctions between the male and female forms of speech; the other dialect is Paʔkualiʔ (cf. Li 1980). While such distinctions between the male and female speech forms are still preserved in the older generation's speech, younger speakers tend to ignore these differences and mix the two forms in their speech. This paper attempts to examine verb classes in Mayrinax Atayal. To our knowledge, there are four studies2 that deal primarily with verb classification in certain Formosan languages; namely, Jeng (1981) on Yami, Chen (1987) and Y. Huang (1988) on Amis, and Tseng (1989) on Squliq Atayal. Most of these studies rely heavily on [End Page 364] syntax—case relations, case forms, and distributional properties. In this paper, we attempt to classify Mayrinax verbs on the basis of certain semantic, morphological, and syntactic properties. We first consider how verbs are formed in the language. We then show a primary classification for them, namely, dynamic verbs versus stative verbs.3 While dynamic verbs designate actions, processes, or situations, stative verbs tend to denote properties, states, or resultant states. We attempt to justify such a classification by examining the semantic dynamicity (or stativity) of Mayrinax verbs, and the morphosyntactic behaviors they exhibit in the focus system,4 in negative, imperative, and causative constructions, and in the tense/aspect/mood system. 2. Verb Formation in Mayrinax Atayal. Languages may have various ways of forming verbs. In this section, we will investigate how verbs are formed in Mayrinax Atayal. The language has words that are inherent verbs. As pointed out by Huang (1995), agent-focus verbs appearing in affirmative imperatives are considered to be basic forms5 that are also used in agent-focus realis negative declaratives. These verbs can be further affixed with varying focus markers, tense/aspect/mood markers, and/or causative markers, with or without overt affixation, depending on, among other factors, which argument is in focus (e.g., agent, patient, location, instrument, or beneficiary) and what syntactic construction a given verb is being used in (e.g., declarative or imperative, affirmative or negative). In addition to the above-mentioned inherent verbs and their derivatives affixed with different focus, tense/aspect/mood, and/or causative markers, Mayrinax Atayal has verbs whose basic forms are derived from nouns affixed with either a causative marker, a stative marker, a preposition, or a zero-morpheme focus marker,6 as exemplified in (1-4).7 1. Verbs derived from nouns affixed with the causative marker pa-: a. pa- + qaβuβiŋ 'hat' ⇒ paqaβuβiŋ 'Put on a hat! (AF.IMP)'8 b. pa- + tunaq 'sputum' ⇒ ptunaq 'Spit! (AF.IMP)' [End Page 365] c. pa- + si- + ŋaŋay 'saliva' ⇒ psiŋaŋay 'salivate (AF.NEG)'9 d. pa- + si- + βuq 'sap; juice' ⇒ psiβuq 'juice; suck (AF.NEG)' 2.

"The debate regarding the nature of joint action has come to a stalemate due to a dependence on intuitional methods. Normativists, such as Margaret Gilbert, argue that action‐relative normative relations are inherent in joint action, while non‐normativists, such as Michael Bratman, claim that there are minimal cases of joint action without normative relations. In this work, we describe the first experimental examinations of these intuitions, and report the results of six studies that weigh in favor of the normativist paradigm. Philosophical ramifications and further extensions of this work are then discussed.",0,1

"This essay applies Valerie Flint’s thesis about the adoption of astrology and derivative forms of prognostication by the medieval Catholic Church to Catalan treatises on astrology. Two main arguments against the practice of magic in the Middle Ages actually favored the development of astrology and astrological magic. By demonstrating that astrology does not subjugate free will to celestial bodies or contravene God’s authority, Christian astrologers smuggled it into the mainstream of scientific practice. Catalan scholars contributed to this defense, providing textual evidence from the thirteenth to the late fifteenth centuries. The use of these two arguments to defend astrology will become so embedded in the literature that, by the late fifteenth century, such defenses appear as commonplaces. We find them even in popular texts on astrological lore, far removed from their original context as part of academic and theological discourse.",0,1
"Abstract 4990 bi-syllabic English words were syllabified by about 22 native speakers who choose between different slash divisions (e.g. photon: FOW / TAHN, FOWT / AHN). Results for test items with one medial consonant are reported in Eddington, Treiman, & Elzinga (2013 Eddington, D., Treiman, R. and Elzinga, D. 2013. Syllabification of American English: Evidence from a Large-scale Experiment. Part I. Journal of Quantitative Linguistics, 20(1): 45–67. [Taylor & Francis Online] , [Google Scholar]). In the present paper, the regression analysis of words with two, three, and four medial consonants are discussed. A model in which syllables are made to be as word-like as possible is supported; syllables are made that begin and end in the same phonemes and graphemes that are legal word-initially and finally. Syllabifications also coincide with morphological boundaries. In words with two medial consonants, stressed syllables attract consonants, and a sonorant first consonant is more likely to be placed in the coda than an obstruent. Clusters comprised of /s/C differ from other two consonant clusters that are legal word-initially; the former tend to be divided between syllables while the latter are placed in the onset.",0,1
"The successful acquisition of a heritage language (HL) has been the focus of much of the research on early bi-, tri- and multilingualism in the last years, since it is this language which is generally delimited within the family environment and finds less continuity outside this context once the multilingual child starts socialising in the community (language). Our study contributes to this research by analyzing Spanish and German as HL or majority languages (MaL) and the children’s (receptive) linguistic competence from 86 multilingual children recruited in Germany and Spain (mean age 57.5 months). With the aid of a linguistic background questionnaire, Family Language Policies (FLP), presence/absence of HL in the family, institution and community for 50 of these children were examined. Our study shows that, in early multilingual acquisition, Spanish and German are acquired similarly when enjoying community support, on the one hand, or when being acquired as heritage languages, on the one hand. In these early years, the chosen FLP seems to have an impact on HL-competence, yet up to age 5;0. Other factors, such as the presence of the HL in the institution, act as useful pillars for promoting HL-competence, yet its presence in the family becomes decisive.",0,1
"This paper investigates an unexplored indexical dimension inherent in the mapping structure of metaphor. The empirical focus is on the metaphor of stain but the scope of indexicality in relation to metaphor might be on a more general level. Based on analyses of a political statement as well as transcripts from a therapy session it is argued that previous accounts on the stain metaphor within CMT are insufficient and only covers parts of the cognitive structures and social aspects of the metaphor. Hitherto, the stain metaphor has been analyzed as part of a larger framework on moral reasoning related to the conceptual metaphors GOOD IS CLEAN, BAD IS DIRTY. This cognitive schema relies on a dichotomy between clean and dirty objects claiming that we understand and experience unmoral, or socially unacceptable behaviors in terms of (interaction with) dirty or filthy objects. However, the analyses in this paper clarify that this account only addresses one dimensions of stains, that is, their tendency to be perceived as dirt, and thereby misses their status as traces or signs. Thus, the accounts offered by CMT miss the fundamental indexical constraints of the stain expression. The source domain of physical stains is in itself constrained by a relation of contiguity (spatiotemporal proximity and association) between the stain and the actions leading to the stain. Thus, in a single expression, the stain metaphor indicates temporal and causal relations in an easily accessible way. Further, the figurative use of “stain” can also be captured as a EFFECT FOR CAUSE metonymy allowing for an intuitive sense of causal relations as well. The central claim of the paper is that metaphor research needs to pay closer attention the kinds of perception of reality that metaphors make possible in-and-through their indexical constraint.",0,1
"In the present paper, we investigate the validity and reliability of de-facto evaluation standards, defined for measuring or predicting the quality of the interaction with spoken dialogue systems. Two experiments have been carried out with a dialogue system for controlling domestic devices. During these experiments, subjective judgments of quality have been collected by two questionnaire methods (ITU-T Rec. P.851 and SASSI), and parameters describing the interaction have been logged and annotated. Both metrics served the derivation of prediction models according to the PARADISE approach. Although the limited database allows only tentative conclusions to be drawn, the results suggest that both questionnaire methods provide valid measurements of a large number of different quality aspects; most of the perceptive dimensions underlying the subjective judgments can also be measured with a high reliability. The extracted parameters mainly describe quality aspects which are directly linked to the system, environmental and task characteristics. Used as an input to prediction models, the parameters provide helpful information for system design and optimization, but not general predictions of system usability and acceptability.",0,1

"This study examines the post-middle school educational careers of Mexican immigrant students. 150 Mexican immigrants students from a port-of-entry middle school graduation class were followed through high school. Initially distinctions were made between charter students (students who began formal U.S. schooling in grades K-2.) and late entrants (students who entered U.S. schools in grades three and above). However, a comparison of their relative graduation rate revealed little about the factors associated with persistence in and secession from high school for either group. In exploring factors associated with high school success or secession, including English proficiency, six nongraduate high school careers statuses were identified. These statuses were generated from observing both student and school behavior, including patterns of academic performance, program placement, and school procedures for reclassifying and processing problem students. Our analysis of these educational career statuses, including graduates, helps illuminate the direction of the relationship between length of time in U.S. schools, English, and high school persistence. The analysis will take into account the academic preparation of middle school charter and late entrant students. The characteristics of these statuses will be described, along with the characteristics of the status incumbents. Mexican and Mexican-American Students in Schools Rather than directly study the adaptation of Mexican immigrant students in high school, researchers have favored an indirect approach, attempting to identify recent arrivals in large “Hispanic” data bases. This includes Buriel and Cardoza's (1988) intergenerational study that shows how Spanish language proficiency diminishes among immigrants as educational aspirations rise.",0,1

"This article explores the relationship between low- and high-level aspects of reading by studying the interplay between word processing, as measured with eye tracking, and narrative absorption and liking, as measured with questionnaires. Specifically, we focused on how individual differences in sensitivity to lexical word characteristics—measured as the effect of these characteristics on gaze duration—were related to narrative absorption and liking. By reanalyzing a large data set consisting of three previous eye-tracking experiments in which subjects (N = 171) read literary short stories, we replicated the well-established finding that word length, lemma frequency, position in sentence, age of acquisition, and orthographic neighborhood size of words influenced gaze duration. More importantly, we found that individual differences in the degree of sensitivity to three of these word characteristics, i.e., word length, lemma frequency, and age of acquisition, were negatively related to print exposure and to a lesser degree to narrative absorption and liking. Even though the underlying mechanisms of this relationship are still unclear, we believe the current findings underline the need to map out the interplay between, on the one hand, the technical and, on the other hand, the subjective processes of reading by studying reading behavior in more natural settings.",0,1
"This paper looks at a well-documented form in Irish English, ‘be after + Verb-ing’ (e.g. ‘He's after forgetting to pay her’) which roughly equates to the present perfect aspect in Standard English. The structure, a calque on an Irish form, has been used in the past in literature and cartoons to both characterize and stigmatize Irish English. This paper tests the hypothesis that this structure is still widely used in Irish English today because it has acquired pragmatic specializations which do not have an equivalent in the Standard English form. This paper draws on one million words of Irish English recorded in different parts of Ireland to form the Limerick Corpus of Irish English, recorded between 2001 and 2005. All of the occurrences of the form in the corpus were isolated and analyzed in context. A number of pragmatically specialized functions were identified and discussed. The distribution of the form across gender and particularly across a range of age groups, especially among young adult speakers, suggests that the form is robustly placed within Irish English. It is concluded that because its pragmatically specialized functions do not have an adequate equivalent in Standard English, it has and will remain as part of the core grammar of Irish English.",0,1

"Young children excel at pragmatic inferences known as ad hoc quantity implicatures: they can infer, for example, that a speaker who said “the card with apples” meant the card with nothing but apples. However, it is not known whether children take into account the speaker’s perspective in deriving such inferences, as adults are able to do, and as the received theories of pragmatics claim. In two experiments, we tested children (5–7 years, N = 33 and N = 25) and adults using a picture-matching director task, in which participants played a game giving cards to the speaker, with some cards being in common ground and some in privileged ground. We found that adults can both derive implicatures when all information is in common ground and not derive them when relevant information is in privileged ground. Children also derive ad hoc implicatures when relevant information is in common ground but, crucially, fail to not derive them when it is in privileged ground. Children’s difficulty with integrating perspective-taking with pragmatic inferencing challenges the received theories about the necessity of perspective-taking in pragmatics.",0,1

"Reviewed by: Determiners: Universals and variation Rostyslav Bilous Jila Ghomeshi, Ileana Paul, and Martina Wiltschko, eds. 2011. Determiners: Universals and variation. In the series Linguistik Aktuell 147. Amsterdam/Philadelphia: John Benjamins. Pp. 247. US $149.00 (hardcover). The authors whose papers are included in this collection seek to contribute to answering one of the core questions in modern linguistic theory:Which properties of languages are universal, and which are variable? The main goal of the volume is to identify, based on recent formal and interpretational work, the range of variation in morphological, syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic properties of determiners across a relatively broad range of typologically and geographically unrelated languages. The proposed analysis and theorizing recognize the necessity of separating word class determiners from the syntactic position which hosts the items so classified, namely D, since recent investigations have shown that membership in the word class determiner is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for occupying the syntactic position D. Moreover, determiners not only play a role in the creation of arguments, but they are also associated with the feature of definiteness. The book is divided into three parts, each one addressing one of the following core issues: (i) characterization of the category of Det and of the features it comprises, (ii) function of determiners, and (iii) relation between determiners and the notion of definiteness. Based on the most recent theoretical proposals and interpretations, much of language variation is argued to stem from differences in the properties of features associated with functional heads. Determiners are assumed to occupy a position fixed by the hierarchy of functional categories, allowing for the dissociation between the word class (determiner) and the syntactic position its members occupy (D). In other words, there is no one-to-one correspondence between them, and therefore word classes other than determiners should be able to occupy D (e.g., pronouns, proper names, demonstratives). Although the papers in this collection generally support the idea that features can bundle together in different ways in different languages, the notion of definiteness and its relation with determiners and D are treated as central, apparently because the authors are inclined to believe that any determiner has two key syntactic and semantic roles: it is the head of a noun phrase and the indicator of definiteness. Therefore, the relation between determiners and the [End Page 128] realization of other features, primitive or derived, such as referentiality, specificity, genericity and so on, is given little or no attention throughout the book. The fact is that featural interpretations vary (among linguists) and featural saliency is different in different languages. For example, while specificity is more salient in Ukrainian, definiteness seems to be more salient in English. One could say that just as accusativity is a universally prototypical or canonical marking of internal arguments, definiteness could be a canonical (but not a defining) property of determiners. This generalization allows for the existence of other features equally realisable on different determiners crosslinguistically. In this perspective, referentiality, and argument-hood could be associated with DP only. In Part 1 Wiltschko investigates the morphosyntactic features that make up determiners (i.e., features expressed on D) in Blackfoot, German, and Halkomelem, without addressing the categorical identity of D. Definiteness is not among these features, though. It is shown that the formal properties of these features differ significantly in a way which is independent of feature content. Some features, associated with a binary opposition, enter into an obligatory contrast while others do not, being monovalent. The first type of features corresponds to a head-complement relation. The second set of features is either present or absent. In the latter case, the determiner is simply not specified for this feature. Determiners in the context of proper names are the subject of investigation offered by Ghomeshi and Massam. They take the DP approach (as opposed to the NP approach) towards names appearing with an overt determiner, given that in some languages names can be preceded by regular determiners and can also function as predicates. This analysis supports the idea that there is indeed a phonologically empty D specified for the feature [proper] in languages in which names are not preceded by an overt...",0,1

"En el archivo de Eugenio Coseriu hay un material inédito, consistente en algunas notas, referencias y comentarios, sobre el origen de la expresión española sangre azul (‘linaje noble’).

Coseriu pone en evidencia la vacuidad de otras interpretaciones, a menudo peregrinas, que se han dado con afán más voluntarioso que realista; en particular, la que da una explicación sociológica y étnica del origen de sangre azul, consistente en que la piel pálida, no curtida por el trabajo en el campo, de los aristócratas y miembros de la realeza, sobre todo si eran de linaje godo, deja traslucir el color azulado de sus venas.",0,1
"Abstract This paper discusses the current understanding of what has been called nominal concord , whereby modifiers of a noun match certain features of the noun (e.g., gender, number, or case features). Part I discusses the existing understanding of concord, remaining as descriptive as possible. Concord has been argued to involve gender, number, case, and definiteness, and nearly every word class that can be present inside nominal phrases is capable of showing concord. I consider some questions concerning the typology of concord, which is largely uncharted territory. Part II focuses on existing formal analyses of concord. Analyses of ϕ ‐feature concord are rather varied, but analyses of case concord more or less converge on the same mechanism. Finally, I consider the insight offered by analyses of cases of mixed concord, where modifiers do not all match each other or the head noun in features or feature values.",0,1
"This study examined audience perceptions of a political candidate’s credibility and likeability as a function of varying the candidate’s responses to an opponent’s nonverbal disparagement during a televised debate. 412 participants watched a purported televised debate between candidates for mayor in a small city in Utah. In all six versions, one debater engaged in strong nonverbal disagreement during his opponent’s opening statement. His opponent responded to the nonverbal behavior with one of six decreasingly polite messages. Results indicated that more direct (i.e., less polite) messages increased audience perceptions of the speaker’s expertise and character compared to providing no response. The results also showed a significant interaction between response type and audience member’s level of trait verbal aggressiveness. The “indirect” and “on-record with redress” responses led to stronger perceptions of speaker composure and extroversion for members high in verbal aggression and the “off the record” strategy led to higher perceptions of extroversion and composure for members low in verbal aggression.",0,1

"Two college-age samples, one from the United States (Washington, DC) and one from Spain (Madrid), were studied with mixed methods, phenomenological (with qualitative analyses) and traditional experimental (with quantitative analyses) - regarding the alleged foundational topic of `unfairness'. Participants gave their instantiations of `It's not fair!' (`No es justo'), which were deconstructed and qualitatively analyzed to find and compare the essential types of unfairness. Using traditional experimental methods, unfairness vignettes were rated by severity and quantitatively analyzed, to see whether the two cultural groups make similar or different distinctions among the concepts of `unfairness', `injustice' and `misfortune'. From qualitative analyses, the fairness principles of `equity' and `equality' appeared in both groups, but `honor and dignity' violations were much more frequent in the Spanish group, as different fairness principles interacted in complex ways. From the quantitative analyses, `unfairness' was the broadest of the three concepts, extending beyond `injustice' and both cultural groups viewed `misfortunes' as `unfairnesses'. Implications for a commonsense morality across cultures are discussed.",0,1

"Die linguistische Erklärung oder Kommentierung keltischen Sprachmaterials ist mit vielerlei methodischen und epistemologischen Problemen verbunden. Die Problematik fängt bereits mit dem Gegenstand an, der hier zur Untersuchung steht: keltische Religion. Das Innerliche der Religion als etwas Subjektives und weitgehend Illusionäres ist nicht faßbar; zu erahnen sind religiöse Inhalte nur an ihren äußeren Manifestationen, die aber meist Ausdruck eines in kultischen Handlungen, Gebärden usw. ritualisierten kollektiven religiösen Bewußsteins – oder auch nur seinem Sinn nach nicht mehr bewußten Brauchtums – sind. Wo explizite Beschreibungen des religiösen Systems und seiner Glaubensinhalte nicht vorliegen oder dieses System sich nicht in literarischen Zeugnissen selbst manifestiert (wie in der griechisch-römischen oder der nordgermanischen Überlieferung), ist es sehr schwer, wenn nicht unmöglich, aus den äußerlichen Manifestationen – aus Kultstätten, Altären, Opfern, Weihgaben, Götterstatuen und Götternamen –, die ihrerseits erst der Interpretation bedürfen, auf den wesentlichen Inhalt und den inneren Zusammenhang des Systems zu schließen. Es ist klar, daß unser Zugang interdisziplinär sein, also die verschiedensten Zeugnisse miteinander kombinieren muß in einer Art Beweisführung aufgrund verschiedenartiger Indizien.

"This paper traces the move of the concept of “creolization” from the discipline of linguistics to those of anthropology and history during the second half of the twentieth century, focusing on its uses in New World slavery studies. Two positions are contrasted in recent studies of North American slavery, those of African-Centrists and those of creolists, with the first stressing the continued importance of African heritage and identities in the New World and the second emphasizing the newness of the institutions that enslaved Africans and their descendants created in the Americas. Several exemplary studies of creolization in different parts of the Americas are reviewed. The paper suggests that ideology and subject position often drive historical analyses and that only strict historicization will permit further advances in understanding the complex processes that we call “creolization.”",0,1

"This article reviews the Index of Linguistic Insecurity (ILI) as carried out for New York City by Labov and for Winnipeg by Owens and Baker and compares both to surveys done in southeastern Michigan in 2005, 2006, and 2007. The Michigan results, in spite of the apparent linguistic security there determined in earlier studies, reveal an even stronger insecurity than that reported for New York City. The article concludes that regional security does not imply personal security and shows a predominance of prescriptivist norms for the items surveyed in the Michigan studies as well as a higher incidence of insecurity for items that have poorly established community norms. The idea of linguistic insecurity as established in earlier studies is challenged by proposing instead a principle based on one’s fear of a personal inability to carry out a linguistic task.",0,1
"Our intention in this article is to document and analyse an exceptional period in Flemish linguistic history that has not received a lot of attention thusfar, viz., the 1950s through the 1980s. We will argue that these decades mark a period best described as an era of hyperstandardisation, as they involved a large-scale, propagandistic, scientifically supported and highly mediatised linguistic standardisation campaign that has thoroughly ideologised language use in all corners of Flemish society. We will propose that the Flemish ‘intermediate variety’ ( tussentaal ) ought probably to be seen as an unmistakeable side-effect of this hyperstandardisation process rather than as a transitional stage on the road to full standardisation or the result of a decline in standardisation efforts. In addition to this, we will propose that discourses of declining standardisation efforts are difficult to reconcile with the recruitment of linguistic standardisation in the new global economy.",0,1

"In Amsterdam in 1661, the Dutch missionary Daniël Gravius published a volume comprising his translations of the Gospels of St. Matthew and St. John in a Formosan language, Siraya. Until recently, it was thought that only the translation of the Gospel of St. Matthew had survived. However, a copy of the 1661 publication has now been identified, which contains both Gospel translations. This article aims to provide details of how this discovery was made, to assess its significance, to offer some preliminary comments concerning the language of the translation, and to suggest what future research should be undertaken on the translation. The article makes a start by providing a brief history of the Dutch presence in Taiwan in the seventeenth century and the work of missionaries in translating Christian texts into Siraya and another Formosan language, Favorlang, in order to provide the necessary historical context. The article then analyzes the reception of texts in Siraya since the nineteenth century to assess the value to scholarship of the identification of the translation of the Gospel of St. John by Gravius. Next, it makes some preliminary remarks on the language of the translation, above all the lexis and the lexical category of numerals, using Adelaar's monograph on the translation of the Gospel of St. Matthew into Siraya as a reference point. Several lexical items including 'water jar', 'mud', 'cave', and 'to spit' are identified and analyzed. Where possible, reconstructed Proto-Austronesian forms of which the Siraya words are reflexes are provided, as are cognates in other Formosan languages. Furthermore, the article analyzes Siraya noun phrases that occur only in the Gospel of St. John. In short, this contribution is the first attempt to analyze how this recently discovered text contributes to our knowledge of Siraya.",0,1
"The trope of the ""body politic"" is reproduced in a Bengali popular court, or moot, not only through explicit submetaphors of that master metaphor but through a grammatical example of what Peirce called diagrammatic iconism. The iconism of reduplicated verbs with reciprocal meaning became pivotal in the metacommunicative negotiation of the agenda of a rural Bangladeshi moot. Such forms of iconicity analyzed here play traceable roles in particular imaginations of community and give us an opportunity to explore the accessibility of those imaginations to discursive consciousness. The article concludes that the tropes most powerfully shaping the discourse of the moot are those least accessible to metapragmatic consciousness, those that rhetorically contribute to the veiling of their own rhetoricity.",0,1
"Projective content is utterance content that a speaker may be taken to be committed to even when the expression associated with the content occurs embedded under an entailment-canceling operator (e.g., Chierchia & McConnell-Ginet, 1990). It has long been observed that projective content varies in how projective it is (e.g., Karttunen, 1971; Simons, 2001; Abusch, 2010), though preliminary experimental research has been able to confirm only some of the intuitions about projection variability (e.g., Smith & Hall, 2011; Xue & Onea, 2011). Given the sparse empirical evidence for projection variability, the first goal of this paper was to investigate projection variability for projective content associated with 19 expressions of American English. The second goal was to explore the hypothesis, called the Gradient Projection Principle, that content projects to the extent that it is not at-issue. The findings of two pairs of experiments provide robust empirical evidence for projection variability and for the Gradient Projection Principle. We show that many analyses of projection cannot account for the observed projection variability and discuss the implications of our finding that projective content varies in its at-issueness for an empirically adequate analysis of projection.",0,1

"Abstract Changes in politics, the economy, demographics, and local leadership all led to the establishment of the Potter Thomas Bilingual School in Philadelphia in 1969. This paper examines the school’s history and how it has created, implemented, and sustained various language policies that have constituted its bilingual program over the last 30 years. Using Kaplan and Baldauf’s (1997) model, I will identify how Potter Thomas reconfigured its language-in-education policies to challenge “deficit” discourse and promote “resource” discourse (Ruiz, 1984) toward language diversity and speakers of languages other than English. I conclude with present and future challenges to Potter Thomas’ bilingual education program, including a critique of the role Title VII funding has played in the program’s development.",0,1
"This paper presents a critical evaluation of a recent update to Sagart’s “numeral-based phylogeny” of Austronesian languages. The update takes the form of new evidence, including new etymologies and reconstructions of words meaning ‘six’ and ‘ten’ which differ from conventional reconstructions, and updated and expanded evidence for “Southern Austronesian,” a subgroup that contains Kra-Dai and Malayo-Polynesian. This paper argues that Sagart’s new evidence is unconvincing and does not provide additional support for the numeral-based phylogeny. Rather, this paper details shortcomings in new etymologies for ‘six’ and ‘ten’, as well as issues in the comparisons made between Kra-Dai and Malayo-Polynesian. It is concluded that conventional subgrouping proposals remain superior to the numeral-based phylogeny despite recent updates.",0,1
"This article reports the findings of a single study examining irony in talk among friends. Sixty-two 10-min conversations between college students and their friends were recorded and analyzed. Five main types of irony were found: jocularity, sarcasm, hyperbole, rhetorical questions, and understatements. These different forms of ironic language were part of 8% of all conversational turns. Analysis of these utterances revealed varying linguistic and social patterns and suggested several constraints on how and why people achieve ironic meaning. The implications of this conclusion for psychological theories of irony are discussed.",0,1

"In their reviews, Chater and Oaksford, Dutilh Novaes, and Sterelny are critical of our modularist approach to reason. In this response, we clarify our claim that reason is one of many cognitive modules that produce intuitive inferences each in its domain; the reason module producing intuitions about reasons. We argue that in‐principle objections to the idea of massive modularity based on Fodor's peculiar approach are not effective against other interpretations that have led to insightful uses of the notion in psychology and biology. We explain how the reason module evaluates reasons on the basis of their metacognitive properties. We show how the module fulfils a social function, that of producing reasons to justify oneself and convince others and of evaluating the reasons others produce to convince us.",0,1
"AbstractThis paper analyzes naming behavior in Germany in the context of rapid social change. It begins with an overview of general developments in naming in Germany over the last one hundred years, based on data from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP), which supplies us with almost 45,000 datasets. The paper focuses on the periods of World War II and the Cold War since we conclude that general developments in naming were disrupted by these two phenomena. Wartime brings accelerated social change in its wake and people react to this social change — often on an apparently individual level. Here, our findings are in accordance with established sociological theories.",0,1
"The aim of this paper is to impart the recent efforts of dictionary making in Japan, focusing attention on English-Japanese learners' dictionaries currently used in secondary schools. A brief historical note on bilingual dictionaries leads to a discussion of some of the problems involved in their compilation. Lexicographical devices concerning entry words, arrangement and explanation of meanings, grammatical information are appraised. In respect of arrangement of meanings, two recent achievements are presented. As for meaning description, several examples are examined to support the belief that the translation complement is a useful device that makes a translation of the source word accurate and complete. The importance of grammatical information, namely U and C in nouns, and verb patterns, is discussed from the viewpoint of Japanese users. In the concluding remarks, grading the information into usable levels according to its degree of importance is proposed as a means of promoting effective usage of the dictionary.",0,1
"In Subanon, an underdescribed Philippine language of Mindanao Island, the prefix mo- appears multifunctional, much like its cognate in other languages. Predicates bearing the prefix variously denote accidental action, ability, acts of perception, statives, unaccusatives, locomotion, or properties. By establishing the paradigms in which the mo- prefix appears, I show that these are not disparate functions of this prefix and its paradigmatically related counterparts, but rather that this morphology, which I call ""non-volitional,"" functions consistently to cancel out any entailment of volition by the most agent-like argument of the predicate. I further show that the non-volitional paradigm is paradigmatically related to a volitional paradigm, and I establish that other uses of mo- are either idiosyncratic, in the case of predicates denoting locomotion, or belong to a separate adjectival paradigm, for predicates denoting properties. This analysis highlights problems that can arise from using multiple, potentially conflicting criteria to define a paradigm, and in the case of Subanon, I resolve such conflicts by making reference to argument structure.",0,1
"Abstract In the popular imagination, the status of Franz Joseph Gall (1758–1828) as charlatan extraordinaire remains secure: a man who could purportedly diagnose differential talent, skill, and personality on the basis of ‘bumps’ on the skull might indeed seem to deserve a place with the tabloid horoscope constructors. Nonetheless, both in his own day and in the view of later historians. Gall was seen as a supreme technician who made lasting contributions to our knowledge of comparative neuroanatomy. In like fashion, his reputation as a revolutionary neuropsychologist continued to be decisive in the development of modern accounts of functional localisation within the human brain. More recently, the significance of Gall's attempt to overthrow classical faculty theory has been widely acknowledged; the terms of current theoretical debate on the modularity of mind were established by Gall. There is, however, one aspect of Gall's work that has not been subject to re-evaluation by the neuroscience community. Gall's ‘sociobiology’ (to phrase the matter somewhat anachronistically) has remained the province of historians. When members of the phrenological movement combined brain anatomy with physiognomy, one of their aims was to address ethical and political issues: masks of the famous and the infamous constituted vivid reminders of law and disorder. Collections of early phrenological portraits, one of which is described in the following paper [Kaufman, M.H. and Shaw, J.P. Some interesting portraits from the history of phrenology which were probably used to illustrate lectures on physiognomy. Journal of Neurolinguistics 8 , 295–305. 1994], were likewise designed to illustrate how the interaction of intellectual and affective powers determined the individual's contribution to society. Such collections are a prime resource in our (as yet inadequate) attempts to understand how the nineteenth century set the agenda for twentieth century psychology and neuroscience.",0,1

"This study investigates errors of English usage among younger and older users of educated Nigerian English. Based on an electronic written language corpus of 64 129 words, written by 60 Nigerians and containing four different text types (academic writing, informal letters, formal letters and novels), several syntactic features described as typical errors occurring in Nigerian English (NE) in previous studies were analysed. The Chi-square test, used for the comparison of corpus counts, reveals that most of the syntactic features occur with a very low frequency rate among both groups of speakers and that none of these features is used significantly more frequently by younger compared to older speakers. It further reveals that the low frequency of errors indicates that the written English of educated Nigerians is minimally characterised by errors and that the occurrences of errors are affected by speakers’ age and level of education.",0,1

"Le débat sur le statut grammatical en français (adverbes ou prépositions ?) de certains éléments de la phrase a souvent porté sur le cas des ‘prépositions orphelines’. Dans ce cadre, on s'intéresse au cas particulier des structures du type: ‘il m'a sauté dessus’, ‘je lui ai couru après’, ‘elle me tourne autour’, etc., où un élément prépositionnel (ou adverbial ?) se trouve postposé au pronom qu'il régit. Un examen systématique de ce type de constructions, très fréquentes en français parlé, met en évidence, sur la base d'inventaires et d'un corpus de français parlé et écrit, leur statut particulier, du double point de vue syntaxique et sémantique. Au-delà du strict point de vue syntaxique, l'examen débouche sur plusieurs observations: inventaire et nature des verbes et éléments prépositionnels, domaines sémantiques, statut lexical des unités ‘ VII ’ inventoriées.",0,1

"This paper focuses on designing studies that will compare children with developmental language disorders (DLD) drawn from several syndromes in which there are primary impairments in the acquisition of language. This kind of research can be used to address four key questions: (a) What are the developing language phenotypes that characterize specific disorders? (b) What factors are key precursors and predictors of language acquisition in DLD? (c) What are the genes that contribute to DLD in different syndromes? (d) What environmental factors influence the trajectories of language development in DLD? Several design issues are discussed including an overall study design, subject selection and recruitment, matching and comparisons across groups, and methodologies. A number of important challenges to the design and implementation of these kinds of studies are presented in the final section of the paper.",0,1

"This article addresses the claim that superordinate categories tend to be indicated by mass nouns and that this tendency represents a linguistic universal. However, the study that first advanced this claim (Markman 1985, 1989) investigated an inadequate sample of language groups. Testing a under variety of languages, the current study, using the methods applied in that original study, showed that the tendency for superordinate categories to be indicated by mass nouns was not universal. Moreover, we discuss how the method itself, based on the morphosyntax of the mass‐count distinction in English, may not apply cross‐linguistically. Specifically, the nature of the mass‐count distinction involves more than the presence or absence of preceding numerals, classifiers, and quantificational phrases. Consequently, we conclude that the claim of a universal tendency for superordinate categories to be indicated by mass nouns remains open to question.",0,1
"“Adamorobe signing is sweet ,” “The signing in Adamorobe is hard ,” “Adamorobe’s deaf people should sign in an eye‐hard way.” These are discourses about signing in Adamorobe Sign Language (AdaSL), a sign language used in Adamorobe, an Akan farmer village in southern Ghana distinguished by a history of hereditary deafness. By calling AdaSL sweet , hard and so on, deaf people in Adamorobe attribute qualia (sensuous qualities which can include hardness, lightness, dryness, and so on) to different forms of signing. Based on fieldwork stints in Adamorobe spread over a period of 10 years, I analyze how qualic evaluations of AdaSL are expressed differently by deaf people from different generations who have had different rates of exposure to Ghanaian Sign Language in addition to AdaSL. Qualic evaluations of AdaSL are related to qualic evaluations of behavior (Gal 2013; Harkness 2015): there are parallels in discourses about AdaSL being hard and deaf people being hard of character and being hardworking strong farmers. Qualic evaluations of language and social relationships permeate discourses about intergenerational differences, constituting a recurrent theme in the language ideological assemblage (i.e., clusters of language ideologies and other ideologies that impact on language) (Kroskrity 2018).",0,1

Kirkeby's English-Swahili Dictionary is a bilingual dictionary of more than 50 000 entries. The most laudable feature of the dictionary is its attempt to be user-friendly especially in the way the entry words have been arranged and the amount of information given. However, a clear objective for the compilation of the ditionary is lacking. The compilers do not seem to know the lexicographical gap they want to fill, the users they are targeting, and their dictionary-using skills. In discussing the strong and weak points of the dictionary, the article will refer to theories of dictionary criticism. Three criteria set by McMillan (1949) will guide this review article: (1) the quantity of the information in the dictionary; (2) the quality of the information presented; and (3) the effectiveness of the presentation of the information. Questions posed in the course of this article will include: Does the dictionary give the information required by the user? Is the information transparently accessible?

"Computer-based interviewing systems could use models of respondent disfluency behaviors to predict a need for clarification of terms in survey questions. This study compares simulated speech interfaces that use two such models–a generic model and a stereotyped model that distinguishes between the speech of younger and older speakers–to several non-modeling speech interfaces in a task where respondents provided answers to survey questions from fictional scenarios. The modeling procedure found that the best predictor of conceptual misalignment was a critical Goldilocks range for response latency–hat is, a response time that is neither too slow nor too fast–outside of which responses are more likely to be conceptually misaligned. Different Goldilocks ranges are effective for younger and older speakers.",0,1
"Linguists in the past two centuries have, for the most part, approached language as an autonomous entity; their practice has been to study languages without considering the culture, society, or beliefs of the speakers. Autonomous has been attacked from both the left and the right. Critics on the left (in particular Marxists) argue that the separation of language from its societal context reinforces the status quo by downplaying the role of language as an instrument of ideology and social control. Critics on the right object to the value-free analyses of individual languages required by the autonomous approach and to the idea that all languages merit equal attention.The Politics of Linguistics surveys two centuries of debate over autonomy. The discussion includes the political implications of the birth of the modern field of linguistics in the Romantic movement, the views of Marx and Engels on language, the attack on structural linguistics by both Hitler and Stalin, the role of Christian missionary groups and the military in building the field in the United States, and the relation between Noam Chomsky's linguistic theories and his political views.Frederick J. Newmeyer demonstrates that external political demonstrates that external political currents have often influenced the relative popularity of the autonomous approach to language. He argues that autonomous linguistics, far from being inconsistent with progressive political goals, can be creatively applied to the fulfillment of such goals.",0,1
"Abstract There is growing interest in approaching research on language contact and change through an epidemiological, population-based model which takes 'linguistic items' or equivalent as a key unit of analysis. This paper explores a number of elements of such a model, with particular attention to a set of biases which may act as conduits or filters for the transmission of linguistic items in populations. These include a number of such biases introduced in recent models of cultural transmission: a threshold bias, a sociometric bias, a model bias, a conformity bias, and a frequency bias. A further bias is of particular relevance to language, but is argued to be equally important for models of cultural transmission in general. This is a context bias, which takes into account the kind of structural context which a given item or variant presupposes for its function. The presence or absence of a relevant structural context will determine the likelihood that the item will be transmitted, and if so to what degree of faithfulness. These biases may help toward characterising an anatomy of cultural epidemiology which makes explicit the relation between individual cognition, social processes, and population-level structure.",0,1
"Abstract The timing and coordination of articulatory movements is essential to producing speech. A considerable body of literature explores the cognitive and motor control mechanisms involved. This review provides an accessible introduction to that literature, while highlighting articulatory phenomena that challenge prevailing views. We begin with the concept of dynamic articulatory gestures, and their role in the coproduction account of coarticulation. We then outline prominent accounts of gestural coordination. These accounts generally assume that speech planning involves the selection of coarsely grained units, which then unfold involuntarily. Later we consider evidence that speakers rapidly adapt to surprising acoustic feedback, that they plan around the expected timing of upcoming acoustic consequences, and that they reshape the articulatory time course on the fly. These findings suggest that movements can be flexibly modified, and that execution can considerably overlap planning. We advocate for speech models that permit speakers fine‐grained control over unfolding articulation.",0,1

"In the way of commentary, I offer a brief, summative reflection on the complex, multifarious nature of people’s semiotic engagements in and with space. Against the backdrop of three snapshot case studies, I suggest there are actually few neat boundaries to be drawn between the linguistic and non-linguistic, between the semiotic and the spatial, and between the creative and non-creative. These kinds of binarized ways of understanding linguistic-semiotic landscapes are neither helpful nor accurate. In a world of ‘context collapse’, we also need to attend to the ways creativity is often leveraged for its commercial indexicalities and possibilities, blurring the boundaries between play and work, and between communication and commerce. Similarly, we ought not to romanticise ‘grassroots’ and ‘vernacular’ actions as necessarily creative, reflexive or benign. It certainly behoves us to stay mindful of the political economies and class ideologies which shape semiotic landscapes and, indeed, our scholarly approaches to them.",0,1

We recommend ways that could be helpful to obtain a return to reason. These possibilities lead us to a moderately optimistic conclusion.",0,1

"The terminology used to describe people living in socially or legally ambiguous housing conditions is contradictory and contested in often unpredictable ways. Homeless people, as well as the laws and government discourses designed to limit their behavior, frequently choose language that is at odds with what their bodies are actually doing in the spaces they occupy. In this essay I will discuss the oxymoronic verbal formulations for how transients, especially transient women, move through and live in social space by looking at two texts that focus on homeless women and their social power, Marilynne Robinson’s novel Housekeeping, and the biblical Book of Ruth (on which it is partially based). By placing these works in the context of the legal discourses of homelessness and squatting, and gender analyses of mobility, I hope to identify a mode of gendered embodiment based in the language of motion.",0,1
"In this paper I argue that eastern Romance (Italian and Romanian) plurals are underlyingly similar to their western Romance equivalents (e.g. Spanish and old French): they are built from an unmarked (singular) stem and a plural morpheme. Throughout history, this morpheme has fundamentally preserved its formal shape: Romance plural corresponds to the morphophonological feature /coronal/. This feature is realized both in the vocalic alternations of eastern Romance plurals, and in the consonantal [s] plurals of western Romance.",0,1
"This paper examines the status of space and place as notable features of contemporary linguistic research in Oceania. We focus on languages of the insular Pacific because of the relatively well-studied role of space in this region and because of their key role in the broader discipline’s engagement with spatial linguistics. Through an extensive analytical review, we suggest that while space has become an enormously generative domain a strong program has yet to emerge. We argue that the literature reflects a plurality of centering foci, what we have called coupled language-space domains (CLSDs), that guide the disciplinary conversation. Further, we conclude that although authors rarely explicitly discuss and define space and place patterns of implicit agreement around treatments of these key terms are observable. Finally, we note that a focus on the grammatical features of spatial language differentiates spatial analysis in linguistics from other disciplines. We note that research concerned with understanding how space and place manifest in spatial language should be critically centered in broader discourses investigating the nature of space, place, and the significance of either for the human condition.",0,1

Finally, the procedure for structuring the domain of verbs is explained. Suggestions are made for the use of the resulting method for the description of social acts, consisting of 45 verb scales",0,1

Through the use of published sources as well as personal interviews, we trace the origins of the argot to the late nineteenth century, when it may have been used exclusively as a secret language to conceal the illicit activities of some carnival and circus employees, then illustrate the many functions it has served since: as a means of delimiting and maintaining social boundaries; as a children's play language; as a secret language among family members, among the members of various noncircus and noncarnival underworld subcultures, and among penitentiary inmates; and as the show business language of a popular rock and roll disc jockey.",0,1

"Foreign accent syndrome (FAS) is a speech disorder of abrupt onset in which the affected person's spoken output is altered such that it is perceived to have the quality of a foreign accent. FAS has most frequently been reported following stroke or trauma, but the diagnostic label has also been used to capture the clinical presentation of cases of suspected psychiatric origin. We describe here the case of a 37-year-old woman, DR, admitted to emergency for slurred speech, left-sided weakness, headache, and photosensitivity. On clinical grounds, her presentation was of sufficient concern to administer thrombolytic therapy. On day 9 of her admission DR began to speak with a French accent. Over the following months DR's speech alternated between at least five different accents, accompanied by associated behavioural changes. Neuropsychological evaluation and structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging studies conducted four months after her initial presentation revealed no evidence of disrupted language function or a likely causative lesion. This is, to our knowledge, the first description of FAS encompassing multiple distinct accents within a single individual. While the aetiology of DR's initial admission remains obscure, the course and features of her FAS over the following months are characteristic of disorders on the somatoform/factitious spectrum. This case highlights the limitations of a strict division between organic and functional disorders.",0,1

"This squib analyzes a type of ellipsis in Japanese, which I dub particle-stranding ellipsis (PSE). This elliptic pattern, first documented by Hattori (1949, 1960), has been discussed in subsequent work (Arita 2009, Hayashi 2001, Sato 2008, Sato and Ginsburg 2006, 2007, Vance 1993, Yoshida 2004) but has not received due attention in the literature. PSE is used as a truncated reply in colloquial dialogues, as shown in (1).1 In this dialogue, where Speaker A’s question introduces Tanaka as the topic of conversation, Speaker B’s response begins with the noncontrastive topic marker -wa.Rizzi (2005b) proposes within phase theory (Chomsky 2000, 2001, 2004) that the edge of the root may remain unpronounced while still being accessible to semantic interpretation, and he applies this analysis (“the privilege of the root” (PoR)) to topic drop in German (Ross 1982). I propose that PSE instantiates the PoR phenomenon; it arises when the topmost phase head is spelled out at the end of the phase it defines, together with its complement, for phonetic interpretation at PF, while the entire structure is transferred to LF for semantic interpretation.Yoshida (2004) observes that PSE has three distributional properties. First, it can apply only to a sentence-initial topic, as the contrast between (2a) and (2b–c) shows.Second, PSE is a root phenomenon, as shown in (3a). (3a) becomes grammatical with Taroo-wa in the embedded CP, as in (3b). This minimal pair thus shows that (3a) is judged ungrammatical not because there is an embedded topic but because the embedded topic is null.Finally, PSE can occur only once in a clause, as shown by the contrast between (4a) and (4b).PSE is different from so-called argument ellipsis (AE) in Japanese (Kim 1999, Oku 1998, Saito 2004, 2007, Takahashi 2008) because AE exhibits none of the properties that characterize PSE. First, AE can target a non-sentence-initial element, as in (5b–c).Notice that the surface order in (5a–c) itself does not conclusively tell whether AE occurs in the positions indicated by Ø, because Japanese is a free-word-order language. Unless evidence to the contrary is presented, I simply assume that the ellipsis of an NP occurs in the surface positions it would occupy were it pronounced. Indeed, the variants of (5a–c) with an overt pronoun in the gap are grammatical, as shown in (6a–c).Second, AE is not a root phenomenon; it can occur in an embedded clause, as in (7).Finally, AE can occur more than once in a clause, as illustrated in (8).The distributional differences between PSE and AE therefore suggest that the former needs a different treatment from the latter (e.g., LF copy in Kim’s (1999) and Oku’s (1998) theory).Within the standard version of current phase theory (Chomsky 2000, 2001, 2004), Spell-Out applies to the complement of a phase head. Rizzi (2005b) argues that the PoR phenomenon obtains when an element in the specifier of the topmost phase escapes Spell-Out. Consider how this theory applies to German topic drop, illustrated in (9b–c).In (9b–c), a topic moves overtly into Spec,Top. “Topic drop” arises when the phase head Top spells out its complement, leaving the topic inaccessible for pronunciation.As pointed out by Yoshida (2004), this construction exhibits the same patterns as PSE. First, it can only occur in the sentence-initial topic position, as illustrated in (10a–b).Second, as observed by Cardinaletti (1990) and Rizzi (1994, 2005a), German topic drop is a root phenomenon. A null topic cannot occur in an embedded clause even when it occupies the clause-initial topic position. This point is illustrated in (11a–b).Finally, German topic drop can occur only once in the root clause, as shown in (12).I propose within a minimum modification of the standard phase theory that PSE obtains when the phase head Top may optionally be sent to PF at the end of the phase it defines, together with its complement TP. This analysis is shown in (13) for Speaker B’s answer in (1).In (13), the noncontrastive topic marker -wa occupies the Top phase head (see Kayne 1994 and Whitman 1997 for evidence for the clause particle analysis of -wa). The size of the syntactic object sent to the interfaces is different in (13). The Top head and its complement are spelled out to PF for phonetic realization whereas the entire structure including the specifier of the phase head is transferred to LF for semantic interpretation.2The three properties of PSE follow straightforwardly. If the TopP in the root clause is preceded by any other element in the specifier of a higher discourse-functional head in the left periphery (e.g., Foc; see Rizzi 1997), the noninitial TopP is inevitably contained in a higher phase. Hence, the specifier of Top is spelled out in the higher phase. This analysis correctly blocks the derivation for utterances like Speaker B’s shown in (14) where TopBBis first spelled out, leaving the specifier of Top unpronounced, followed by the spell-out of the PP in the specifier of a higher functional head (such as Foc).Similarly, PSE cannot occur in an embedded context because then the specifier of TopP would be spelled out in the next higher phase and would necessarily be phonetically realized. For the same reason, there cannot be more than one PSE in a single clause because the second instance would be within a higher phase.Sato and Ginsburg (2006, 2007) observe that the complement NP of a postposition may also be elided, as shown in (15).Following Abels (2003) and Van Riemsdijk (1978), suppose that PPs are phases. Since phases are associated with the EPP feature, the NP complement of the P is moved to Spec,P. Then, the string Ø -kara-wa results when Spell-Out applies to the P head (i.e., kara ‘from’) as well as to the Top head plus its complement, as represented in (16).3Note that this analysis also correctly predicts that kara ‘from’ may also be elided in Speaker B’s utterance in (15) because the spell-out of the phase head itself is optional.This squib has argued that PSE exemplifies the PoR phenomenon. It has proposed that stranding of the noncontrastive topic marker -wa arises when the Top phase head is optionally spelled out to PF, together with its TP complement, for phonetic interpretation at PF whereas the entire syntactic structure including the topic is transferred to LF for semantic interpretation. This analysis lends support to a nonsimultaneous transfer model of grammar (e.g., Marušič 2005) according to which linguistic interfaces target different parts of the derivation at a phase level.",0,1
"Most English-Japanese learner's dictionaries indicate the importance and vocabulary level of specific entries by attaching one, two, or three stars to each word. Using one monolingual (COBUILD) and four bilingual (Genius, Lexis, Wisdom, and Progressive) learner's dictionaries, the researchers compared the star-rated words with (a) junior/senior high school (JSH) vocabulary to determine denotation validity, (b) high frequency words in the British National Corpus to assess similarity to present-day English, and (c) other materials such as university exams, TOEIC tests, magazines and news broadcasts.

"This article outlines a new approach to data access in electronic encyclopaedias. Contrary to most of the existing research, which treats access as a lexicographer-dominated, structural concept, access is viewed here as a process which is essentially user-driven. The role of the lexicographer is to facilitate this process, so that it can become rapid and unimpeded, but their control of it should be reduced to a minimum. This can only be achieved if access to data is adjusted to the specific type of need for information. Accordingly, the article examines three forms of data access applicable in situations in which the user experiences the need for a finite, specific amount of information. The results of the examination confirm that access to data is indeed a process whose success depends on the interaction between the user, the data, and the type of need for information which the given reference work aims to satisfy.

This article is an attempt at examining the difficulties inherent in translating certain utterances, namely religious expressions, praise names and proverbs, from Cilubà into French and English. It tries to show that once the Biblical message has been indigenized in Cilubà, it becomes very difficult to translate it back again into the European languages, in this case French and English. In fact, it contains""Africanisms"" or local realities which draw on African cosmology which is not always in conformity with the Christian faith. Finally, the use of the ethnography of communication of Cilubà during religious ceremonies leads people to turn to metaphors, proverbs and other aspects of figurative language. Unless turning to functional translation, the interpreter cannot assist French and English speakers to participate in these speech events.Keywords: UTTERANCE, PRAISE NAME, CONTEXT, INDIGENIZATION, LITURGICALREVIVAL, TRANSLATION, TRANSLATION THEORY, PROVERBS, ETHNOGRAPHY OFCOMMUNICATION, FIGURATIVE LANGUAGE",0,1

Abstract: The Lexicographic Corpus in Languages with an Oral Tradition: The Case of the Dialect Fang-Mek?. Corpora form the basis of most linguistic and especially lexicographic research. The compilation of a corpus is a specialised activity on which depends the result of the research to be undertaken. The subject of this article is the compilation of a lexicographic corpus in languages with an oral tradition which requires a different approach from those having a long written tradition. Because of this fact, the latter have an important documentation which can serve as basis for many subjects of research. The author proposes an analytic approach which will allow better to account for lexical and semantic particularities of languages with an oral tradition. Through the method of free oral production, the author bases her hypotheses of research on an experiment in the Fang-Mek? dialect, a language variant of Gabon. The results make it possible to stress two essential factors in the compilation process of languages with an oral tradition: the informants and the representativeness of the corpus. The latter which must encompass varied but also balanced lexical fields, would allow the planning of dictionaries in which the speakers who are the first users, can recognize themselves.

"Abstract This study examines the political discursive construction of the “Chinese Dream” and its representations in global media by drawing on the methodological combination of the discourse-historical approach, corpus linguistics, and framing analysis. The data for analysis consists of Chinese President Xi Jinping’s official speeches and news coverage on the Chinese Dream by the China Daily , the South China Morning Post , and The New York Times for around six years (2012–2018). The analysis identified that the Chinese Dream discourse largely aims to serve toward Chinese nationalism, the reinforcement of the ruling Party’s legitimacy, and the Chinese leadership’s authority. Meanwhile, it was also found that the three media adopted different dominant frames to reshape the Chinese Dream, namely China Daily ’s Chinese national-centric frame, South China Morning Post ’s multiculturalist-oriented frame, and The New York Times ’ US-centric “othering” frame. These news frames were tactically designed to serve their sociopolitical and ideological interests. Through corpus-assisted discourse analysis, the article aims to 1) reveal the discursive strategies and patterns of the Chinese Dream; 2) shed light on the discursive representations of the Chinese Dream in specific global media; and 3) bridge the gap between the original political discourse and its discursive reproduction in media representation.",0,1

The focus is on scholars' ethnic/racial coding of African American, which is used interchangeably with the label Black. While there has been a growing body of research that shows African American English (AAE) varies both regionally and across social lines (e.g., age, gender, class), slow to follow is work addressing variation within the ethnic/racial category African American/Black in and of itself. This paper argues the field of sociolinguistics and related fields are at a crossroads in terms of how we categorize people within ethnically diverse African American/Black communities in the United States and offers methodological solutions.",0,1

"THE GENERAL THEORY OF TERMINOLOGY: A BASIS FOR THE PREPARATION OF CLASSIFIED DEFINING DICTIONARIES Wolfgang Nedobity Specialized languages are the tools for subject communication by which modern society conveys its achievements and experience from generation to generation and from people to people. The specialized languages are characterized by using clearly defined concepts to which preferably unambiguous terms are assigned. The concepts form systems of concepts in the individual subject fields. Together with their assigned terms they constitute the respective terminology, which reflects the state of human knowledge about the subject field in question. Terminologies have an influence on scientific, technical, and economic progress. Deficient terminologies endanger the information flow not only between people but from people to machine and machine to machine as well. Therefore the terminological problem has to be solved at the right time before it causes an impairment of information flow. At the beginning ofthe century, Eugen Wüster realized that unified standards and guidelines are necessary for the solution of the terminological problem. In order to provide a theoretical basis for such guidelines for terminology work, he developed the General Theory of Terminology. A first step in this direction was his thesis with the title International Standardization of Technical Languages (1931). In his later years he also gave a lecture on this subject at the University ofVienna (Wüster 1979). The Essence of the General Theory of Terminology Wüster combined in his theory the findings of logic, epistemology, linguistics, information science and various other subject fields with the aim to create a workable and 69 70The General Theory of Terminology practice-oriented basis for the ordered development and documentation of subject vocabularies (Wüster 1973). He suggested that vocabularies should be presented in a systematic or classified way. This is only possible if a concept-oriented approach is chosen which outlines the relationships between the elements of the vocabulary. Thus research in the field ofconceptology is a prerequisite for work in systematic terminology. Conceptology: The Key to Efficient Terminology Work In special languages meanings are formulated by means of concepts and conveyed to others by means of terms. Concepts refer to objects of the inner or outer world. Individual objects can be as concrete as a stable or as abstract as the pain one perceives. Concepts can refer not only to things and events but also to properties and relations. A concept, however, is only a mental construction derived from objects. In order to communicate that mental construction, a symbol is assigned to the concept that represents it, usually a term in technical communication. What is found to be common in a set of individual objects is summarized or abstracted mentally and expressed by a concept. In this way the concept is an element of thinking which comprises the characteristics common to a number of objects. The aggregate of characteristics of a concept is called its intension. Every concept is a member of a class of concepts and can itself form a class of concepts which are encompassed by it. The aggregate of all subordinate concepts (species) on the same level ofabstraction or of all individual objects which belong to the concept in question is called extension. The aggregate of all individual objects is also called class. The characteristics of concepts help us classify concepts and construct systems of concepts (see Felber 1982:4). Concepts are formed, not simply inductively, that is, Wolfgang Nedobity71 through observation of environmental regularities, nor simply deductively, through the application of alreadyformed cognitive structures to events and objects, but through the reciprocal interaction of cognitive structures and environmental events. We develop concepts through testing them against reality and we develop a knowledge of the world through the elaboration of concepts and conceptual systems (see Bolton 1977:10-14). Classifying Concepts in Subject Vocabularies In order to make subject terminologies accessible to the users, they are published either as terminological standards or simply as dictionaries. In these publications the entries consisting of terms and their definitions are arranged following the meaning ofterms (systematic order) or in alphabetical order ofthe terms. Terminological standards and dictionaries can be systematic or alphabetical. The systematic order is to be preferred. If full classification is not...",0,1

"Abstract In a broad, sociologically based view of pragmatics, historical pragmatics is a field of study that wants to understand the patterns of intentional human interaction (as determined by the conditions of society) of earlier periods, the historical developments of these patterns, and the general principles underlying such developments. It is based on an empirical study of historical data in all the diversity in which it has survived. Written texts are seen as communicative acts in their own right and they are taken to comprise a broad range of varieties of language that can be located on several different variability scales, such as the scale from the language of immediacy to the language of distance. The field of historical pragmatics can be split into subfields on the basis of the linguistic unit under investigation; from expressions to utterances, discourses, and discourse domains. Future work in historical pragmatics is expected to rely even more heavily on corpus‐linguistic methodologies and to increase the sophistication of such analyses, particularly in terms of pattern searches for functional elements and the inclusion of contextual features.",0,1
"Evidentials, which introduce the speaker’s perspective regarding information being presented, can be divided into at least two classes in Cree: CP‐external (with illocutionary force) and IP‐external (with temporal or modal force). Cree dialects differ in their deployment of evidentials. CP‐external evidentials include quotative verbs (attested in all Cree dialects) and reportative particles (in Plains Cree). IP‐external evidentials include dubitative particles (in Plains Cree) as well as affixal indirect evidentials that are temporally conditioned (in Cree/Montagnais/Naskapi).

"Reviewed by: Sociologie du monde des sourds by Diane Bedoin Olivier Le Guen (bio) Sociologie du monde des sourds, by Diane Bedoin (Paris: La Découverte, 2018, softcover, 128 pages, €10, ISBN: 978-2707193155) Sociologie du monde des sourds, or Sociology of the Deaf World, by Diane Bedoin, provides an extensive summary of the sociological situation of deaf people in France up to the 2010s. One thing the reader should be aware regarding French books such as those of the Collection Repères is that they are designed for a large audience of nonspecialists who want to quickly grasp a specific matter. In this sense, Bedoin's book complies with its goal. Chapter 1 deals with the definition of Deaf and deafness internationally and in the French context, specifically looking at how deafness is categorized—who the deaf people are. The chapter provides much qualitative (typological information) and quantitative (statistical) information. What constitutes a deaf person? This question is central in the first chapter and reminds us (especially scholars working on sign language) that deafness goes much beyond deaf signers. First, not everyone is equally deaf, and three categories are used to categorize ""hard of hearing"" in terms of hearing loss: light (between 21 and 40 dB), medium (between 41 and 70 dB), and severe (between 71 and 90 dB). In France, the vast majority of people categorized as deaf are actually not signers, and of the 5.5 million with profound deafness (i.e., superior to 90 dB), 88 percent became deaf or are elderly. Declared users of LSF (French Sign Language) are estimated to total around 283,000—that is, only 5.15 percent of the deaf people in France. Chapter 2 has a more historical focus, looking at how the figure of the ""Deaf"" has been created in the West. Although the description starts in antiquity, more discussion focuses on the last century or so. Interestingly, Bedoin writes, in the medieval period, deaf people were not discriminated against and lived autonomous lives. This was [End Page 631] possible mostly because they were considered productive members of the society and because of a positive attitude towards gesturing (many monastic orders who vowed silence used a gestural system of communication, now called alternate sign language). Such a context reminds us of the current cultural settings of many so-called ""emerging sign languages"" around the world; see, for instance, Johnson (1991) and the summer 2018 issue of Sign Language Studies focusing on rural sign languages. The Renaissance sees some interesting attempts at teaching some form of visual system of communication, mainly because the ""deaf-mutes"" (as they were called then) who would benefit it were born in elite families and for legal reasons (mostly inheritance). During the eighteenth century, many schools for deaf people arose (the most famous by L'abbé Charles Michel de L'Épée (1712–1789) in France) grounded in new philosophical ideas promoted by scholars like Diderot and Rousseau regarding the origin of language and the possibilities of education of the disabled. These were the first steps at formalizing what are now (institutionalized) sign languages, like LSF or American Sign Language (ASL). Although these efforts were promising first steps for the promotion of sign languages, progress was interrupted by the international congress of Milan in 1880 that, on the basis of biological, medical, religious, linguistic, and political arguments, promoted oralism instead. Interestingly, some resistance emerged for and by the Deaf, in informal gatherings (or banquets), art (paintings, poetry, literature), written press, and even sports. It is, however, really from the 1970s that Deaf culture started to rise again and began being recognized, especially with televised programs, creation of interpreters' curriculum, and the inception of bilingual education. In 2010, a degree (CAPES) in LSF was created for teaching in high schools. However, many deaf people do not comply with the exigencies of the exam entrance, and only two positions are opened each year for the whole country. Chapter 3 discusses the consequences and dilemma between two opposite approaches towards deafness: one stigmatizing it as a handicap (the medical approach) versus the other that promotes it and sees Deafness as a culture and sign language as a...",0,1
"We consider the influence of two types of contextual information, background information available to users and users’ goals, on users’ views and preferences regarding textual explanations generated for the outcomes predicted by Decision Trees (DTs). To investigate the influence of background information, we generate contrastive explanations that address potential conflicts between aspects of DT predictions and plausible expectations licensed by background information. We define four types of conflicts, operationalize their identification, and specify explanatory schemas that address them. To investigate the influence of users’ goals, we employ an interactive setting where given a goal and an initial explanation for a predicted outcome, users select follow-up questions, and assess the explanations that answer these questions. Here, we offer algorithms to generate explanations that address six types of follow-up questions. The main result from both user studies is that explanations which have a contrastive aspect about a predicted class are generally preferred by users. In addition, the results from the first study indicate that these explanations are deemed especially valuable when users expectations differ from predicted outcomes; and the results from the second study indicate that contrastive explanations which describe how to change a predicted outcome are particularly well regarded in terms of helping users achieve this goal, and they are also popular in terms of helping users achieve other goals.",0,1

Ademas, se usan una jerarquia de conceptos (WordNet) y reglas heuristicas basadas en los patrones semanticos de VerbNet para apoyar a las operaciones. El conjunto resultante de grafos representa al resumen del texto a nivel conceptual. El metodo se evaluo con la coleccion de datos DUC 2003. Los resultados muestran que el metodo es efectivo para resumir textos cortos EnglishIn this study, we propose a model for generating single-document abstractive summaries, based on the conceptual representation of the text. Although there are studies that take into account the partial syntactic or semantic representation of the text, so far, a complete semantic representation of texts has not been used for generating summaries. Our model uses a complete semantic representation of text by means of conceptual graph structures. In this context, the task of generating the summary is reduced to summarize the set of corresponding conceptual graphs. In order to do this, a set of operations on graphs is applied: generalization, join or association, ranking, and pruning. Furthermore, a hierarchy of concepts (WordNet) and heuristic rules based on the semantic patterns from VerbNet are used in order to support such operations. The resulting set of graphs depicts the text summary at the conceptual level. The method was evaluated on the DUC 2003 data collection. The results show that the method is effective for summarizing short texts",0,1
"L'idee que la co-jonction est une operation fondamentale qui consiste a associer deux objets syntaxiques au moyen d'un « jonctif » dans la construction de certaines structures complexes est developpee ici dans deux domaines empiriques distincts sur une base non-transformationnelle. Dans la premiere partie, il est montre que les PHRASES COMPLEXES de l'ancien francais composees d'une subordonnee disloquee a gauche et d'une principale qui la suit - et qui crucialement, peut etre « introduite » par un adverbe ou une conjonction - peuvent etre analysees dans le cadre de la syntagmatique X-barre comme l'association du specificateur et du complement structuraux d'une tete (con-)jonctive (realisee par cet adverbe ou cette conjonction), tete qui, sur le plan semantique, joue un role soit de reperage, soit de connecteur logique: les circonstancielles, conditionnantes, et meme les relatives libres disloquees de l'ancien francais illustrent ce type, et suggerent que l'absence, toujours possible, de jonctif segmental peut s'interpreter comme la presence d'un jonctif zero. Dans la seconde partie, la MODIFICATION NOMINALE par des propositions relatives, des syntagmes adjectivaux, des syntagmes prepositionnels, et meme des syntagmes nominaux qui denotent des possesseurs, est examinee dans des langues typologiquement tres differentes, dans lesquelles un morpheme special apparait entre le nom et le modificateur: la contribution semantique de ce morpheme peut alors s'analyser typiquement (dans les cas d'interpretation restrictive) comme celle d'un connecteur permettant de construire l'intersection de l'ensemble denote par le nominal et de celui denote par l'expression modifiante (une autre interpretation etant disponible dans le cas des interpretations dites appositives).

"This paper looks at Erazm Rykaczewski’s A Complete Dictionary English and Polish … (1849), one of the milestones in the history of English-Polish / Polish-English lexicography. Despite its significance for the bilingual user in Poland and English-speaking countries with large Polish diasporas, where it came to be reprinted over the next century, it has attracted little scholarly attention so far. Based on a comparative analysis of the bilingual dictionary and its assumed sources, the paper sheds some light on the methodology of compilation in which borrowing, adaptation, and translation turn out to have been the lexicographer’s main working practice. The findings are presented in a framework which describes the macro- and microstructural strategies employed to create a successful learning tool.",0,1

"ABSTRACT Singapore's Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) railway system is a highly effective and rather inexpensive way of getting around the Lion City, although locals sometimes complain about overcrowding in the carriages and about noise levels experienced in apartment blocks situated near the lines. Generally speaking, passengers are well provided with information too, including maps of the MRT system in the stations, screen data about train arrivals, and clearly enunciated announcements (in English, Mandarin, Malay and Tamil) inside the carriages about upcoming stations and connections. However, one quibble can be raised about the English version of these announcements, which sometimes features the verb ‘to alight’. This is explored.",0,1
"AbstractNaming practices are significant communicative acts. Given names convey aspects of identity, social circumstances, and cultural conditioning. In this study, several issues regarding naming practices in China are considered. The results show that given names possess multiple levels of meanings, including parental expectations, birth circumstances, lineage, parental affection/love, commemoration, and gender qualities. Although the impact of a given name on a person's everyday life is viewed as mostly symbolic, a given name is believed to have the power of motivating and inspiring individuals. Good given names are meaningful, bear parental wishes, hopes, and love, and are pleasant to hear.",0,1
"The World Wide Web (WWW) today is so vast that it has become more and more difficult to find answers to questions using standard search engines. Current search engines can return ranked lists of documents, but they do not deliver direct answers to the user. The goal of Open Domain Question Answering (QA) systems is to take a natural language question, understand the meaning of the question, and present a short answer as a response based on a repository of information. In this paper we present QARAB, a QA system that combines techniques from Information Retrieval and Natural Language Processing. This combination enables domain independence. The system takes natural language questions expressed in the Arabic language and attempts to provide short answers in Arabic. To do so, it attempts to discover what the user wants by analyzing the question and a variety of candidate answers from a linguistic point of view.",0,1
"The aim of this paper is twofold. On the one hand, it attempts to explore several machine learning models for pronoun resolution in Turkish, a language not sufficiently studied with respect to anaphora resolution and rarely being subjected to machine learning experiments. On the other hand, this paper offers an evaluation of the classification performances of the learning models in order to gain insight into the question of how to match a model to the task at hand. In addition to the expected observation that each model should be tuned to an optimum level of expressive power so as to avoid underfitting and overfitting, the results also suggest that non-linear models properly tuned to avoid overfitting outperform linear ones when applied to the data used in our experiments.",0,1
"An experiment was conducted to investigate whether variation in articulation rate has a specific domain in spontaneous Czech speech. Three types of unit were examined as candidate domains: the interpause stretch, the intonation phrase, and the clause. Articulation rate within these units was measured for each phonological word. The analysis showed that articulation rate was not constant in any of these candidate domains. However, a regular pattern was found within the intonation phrase, consisting of a slowing down (rallentando) with the first or the second phonological word being the fastest word in the majority of intonation phrases. Although phrase-final lengthening contributes to the decrease at the end of the intonation phrase, other factors contribute to the overall pattern. As one possible determinant of articulation rate, the size of phonological words was considered. Only a weak tendency was found for the articulation rate of the word to increase with its size expressed in the number of syllables. The hypothesis that the interpause stretch and/or clause might constitute hierarchically higher domains of variation in articulation rate was not confirmed. The intonation phrase seems to be a domain of articulation rate variation, specifically, phrase-final lengthening. Some evidence was also found for the interpause stretch as a superordinate domain of phrase-final lengthening.",0,1
"1. In OE,' long consonants are fully established in one and only one position: between a fully stressed or a half-stressed SHORT vowel (or diphthong) and a following unstressed vowel, as in clyppan, settan, reccan, ebba, middel, hycgan, frogga, fremman, spinnan, spillan, steorra, sifban, missan, hliehhan (hlxhhan), and (after a half-stressed short vowel) in bliccettan 'glitter', oretta 'challenger', faranne (inf.), westenne 'wilderness'.2 In MSS of the 10th century, double letters are written with great consistency in such words, whereas in other words single letters appear with equal consistency in the same position, e.g. in witan 'know', sunu 'son', stelan 'steal'. The consistent writing of double letters in some of these words and of single letters in others makes it clear that between a short stressed or half-stressed vowel and a following unstressed vowel long and short consonants are in phonemic contrast in OE. To support this inference from the spelling, one may cite such minimally differentiated pairs as sittan 'sit' : witan 'know', sellan 'sell' : stelan 'steal'.",0,1

"There is accumulating evidence that readers continually evaluate the consistency, congruence, and coherence of text by processes of validation. Validation is initiated immediately on stimulus presentation, may proceed nonstrategically, and serves as a criterion for representational updating. However, validation exhibits a variety of deficiencies. Readers tend to overlook presupposed anomalies and are prone to both endorse text misinformation and to retain previously encoded misinformation. Here, several challenges concerning validation processing are considered against the backdrop of refinements of Kintsch's construction-integration model. Predictions about upcoming text might facilitate comprehension but demand validation. Conversely, the spillover of processing beyond the current text segment reflects processes subsequent to construction and integration and likely contributes to validation. This theoretical framework raises questions about the staging of comprehension processes and about their possible automaticity. Certain contemporary theories tend to highlight either the successes or deficiencies of validation, but they exhibit enough convergence to offer the promise of an effective analysis.",0,1

"The nature of attention has been the topic of a lively research programme in psychology for over a century. But there is widespread agreement that none of the theories on offer manage to fully capture the nature of attention. Recently, philosophers have become interested in the debate again after a prolonged period of neglect. This paper contributes to the project of explaining the nature of attention. It starts off by critically examining Christopher Mole's prominent “adverbial” account of attention, which traces the failure of extant psychological theories to their assumption that attending is a kind of process. It then defends an alternative, process‐based view of the metaphysics of attention, on which attention is understood as an activity and not, as psychologists seem to implicitly assume, an accomplishment. The entrenched distinction between accomplishments and activities is shown to shed new light on the metaphysics of attention. It also provides a novel diagnosis of the empirical state of play.",0,1
"Metaphors pervade discussions of critical issues and influence how people reason about these domains. For instance, when crime is a beast people are more likely to suggest enforcement-oriented approaches to crime-reduction (e.g., by augmenting the police force); reading that crime is a virus, on the other hand, leads people to suggest systemic reforms for the affected community. In the current study, we find that extending metaphoric language into the descriptions of policy interventions bolstered the persuasive influence of metaphoric frames for important issues. That is, in response to a crime virus people were even more likely to endorse social reforms that were described as “treatments,” while in response to a crime beast people were even more likely to endorse “attacking” the problem with harsh enforcement tactics. Of note, people were not simply drawn to extensions of previously instantiated metaphors: when extended metaphors were paired with a conceptually incongruent policy intervention (e.g., “treating” a crime [virus] by augmenting the police force), we found no preference for the policy response.",0,1
"This paper introduces a typology of adjectives and adjective uses in French that is based on a division between NP-internal and NP-external adjectives. These two classes may be distinguished by their lexico-semantic relationship to the noun, and also by their syntactic properties. I argue that adjectives entering into a close relation with nouns exhibit positional properties that leads to the idea that they are NP-internal. It is shown that, in contrast, regular qualificatives admit postcopular use and thus occur NP-externally. The last part of the paper sets up a syntactic analysis of postnominal NP-external adjectives according to which these adjectives enter into a marked predication relationship with the noun they qualify.",0,1
"ABSTRACT An exploration of how technology is making English – and the human race – evolve. In The Dead Emcee Scrolls , poet and rap artist Saul Williams describes how his writing was transformed by a dance club experience in which the club's beats reset his biorhythms. He writes, Hail Mary. Mother of God. / Got the whole host of angels in my iPod (Williams, 2006:16). Then, later, Neck back jump kiss BREAK. / Uprock freeze pop lock BREAK. / Don't stop don't stop snap BREAK (30). These lines illustrate a growing use of urban hip-hop vernacular that has been distributed with alarming efficiency by the global music trend, through downloadable music and ipods. Music and its beats have created a rhythm to which this iGeneration dialogues, both internally and externally. Technology has given way to a continuum for emotional highs that can be sustained at any place and time. The technological revolution influences the way we socialize, collaborate and exchange acoustic information. Our changing and globalized subjectivities, as well as increasingly powerful acoustic technology, have exerted changes on the English language, making visible a significant revolution in the shaping of language within an increasingly mobile and technological world.",0,1
"Previous research suggests that toddlers can rely on distributional cues in the input to track adjacent and nonadjacent grammatical dependencies. It remains unclear whether toddlers understand the hierarchical phrase structures that determine the corresponding grammatical dependencies. We addressed this question by testing toddlers on two different phrase structures in French that govern distinct patterns of grammatical gender feature agreement. We first show that the two structures are in fact extremely infrequent in children’s input. Then we report on a preferential looking experiment in which French-learning 30-month-olds were presented with French sentences in the two structures, and the grammaticality of the feature agreement was manipulated. Crucially, the contrasting structures contained the same sequentially ordered feature-bearing words in our design (e.g., correct agreement: La bananeFEMININE dans le chapeauMASCLINE, elleFEMININE … ‘The banana in the hat, it …’; incorrect agreement: *La bananeFEMININE et le chapeauMASCLINE, ellesFEMININE … ‘The banana and the hat, they …’). Thus, children must go beyond those words and distinguish the structures hierarchically in order to determine the grammaticality of the different agreement patterns. We predicted that if toddlers rely solely on input support to acquire the structures and the agreement, they should show no discrimination of feature grammaticality. If, however, they can rely on mechanisms beyond linear input, such as the principle of structure dependence in the universal grammar (UG), they should show a grammaticality effect. The results confirmed the latter prediction, demonstrating the possible influence of the learner’s internal system, suggesting that UG knowledge might guide early language development.",0,1
"PurposeThis study investigates the effects of different stimulus repetition rates and multiple electrode recording montages (ipsilateral, contralateral, horizontal, and vertical) on the auditory brainstem response (ABR) wave V amplitude and latency in infants.MethodologyEleven healthy infants with the mean age of 4.36 ± 1.95 months were involved in this repeated-measure design study. Prior to the actual data collection, several preliminary audiological assessments (otoscopic examination, tympanometry, otoacoustic emission and ABR screening at 35 dB normalized hearing level (dBnHL)) were conducted to ensure that all participants had normal auditory functions. Once qualified, the participants were tested with the ABR using 100-microsecond clicks recorded under the four electrode montages at two stimulus repetition rates (19.1 and 61.1 Hz) and at an intensity level of 35 dBnHL.ResultsThe ABR was shown as present in all participants in all four electrode montages and both stimulus repetition rates. The largest wave V amplitude was recorded in the vertical montage for both stimulus repetition rates. No significant changes (P > 0.05) were noted in the wave V amplitudes in all electrode montages when the stimulus repetition rate was changed from 19.1 to 61.1 Hz.ConclusionThis study confirmed that combining the vertical montage with high stimulus repetition rates of 61.1 Hz at 35 dBnHL has the potential for detecting auditory dysfunction in infants, because of the larger and more stable wave V amplitude.",0,1
"Three experiments explored how well children recognize events from different types of visual experience: either by directly seeing an event or by indirectly experiencing it from post-event visual evidence. In Experiment 1, 4- and 5- to 6-year-old Turkish-speaking children (n = 32) successfully recognized events through either direct or indirect visual access. In Experiment 2, a new group of 4- and 5- to 6-year-olds (n = 37) reliably attributed event recognition to others who had direct or indirect visual access to events (even though performance was lower than Experiment 1). In both experiments, although children’s accuracy improved with age, there was no difference between the two types of access. Experiment 3 replicated the findings from the youngest participants of Experiments 1 and 2 with a matched sample of English-speaking 4-year-olds (n = 37). Thus children can use different kinds of visual experience to support event representations in themselves and others.",0,1
"Abstract This study explores the persuasive attack strategies used by participants in the ‘Opposite Direction’ program to attack actions and characters. In particular, the study examines the differences (if any) between the attack strategies directed at actions and those at characters. To this end, 299 utterances which were taken from 30 episodes were analyzed quantitatively using SPSS Base and qualitatively by adopting Benoit’s and Dorries’ (1996), Legge et al.’s (2012), and Benoit’s and Glantz’s (2017) frameworks. The analysis shows that the participants attacked actions more than characters and that these attacks were accomplished by means of two main strategies: 1) increasing the perceived responsibility for the act and 2) increasing negative perceptions of the act. The former was enhanced by using three sub-strategies and the latter by seven sub-strategies. Furthermore, the study found that the participants attacked characters by utilizing two main strategies: 1) enhancing perception that the target possesses a trait and 2) enhancing perception that the trait is offensive. The former was enhanced by means of four sub-strategies and the latter by two sub-strategies. The study provides implications for media and political discourse analysts and researchers of how persuasive attacks are conducted in interactive programs.",0,1

"This paper proposes a three-stage feature selection algorithm by exploring the wavelet packet (WP) decomposition, statistical, and Information Gain (IG) feature ranking algorithm based on high IG entropy for the automatic classification of speech emotions (SE). Effective frame-level vocal tract systems and the excitation source parameters are initially extracted from a few significant WP sub-bands containing emotionally relevant information based on Eigenvalue decomposition. Further, Several intelligent amalgamations of the derived optimal feature vectors are formed for improved performance in a low-dimensional feature space. The fundamental argument is that in case the identification errors of any system subjected to individual feature streams transpire at separate points, there exists a probability that the inclusion of complementary information can nullify a few of these inaccuracies by increasing the available information. The models of the Cost-Sensitive-Decision Tree (CS-DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Decision Tree (DT) have been validated and tested with the proposed setup for their efficacy. Results indicate the superiority of the proposed algorithms compared to other published articles cited in the literature with the CS-DT outperforming others. The proposed low-dimensional amalgamation vectors have witnessed more than 20% improvement in recognition performance with greater speed of response, savings in cost, and lower F- rank hence is a significant achievement in this direction. The link to compute the Hurst parameter for the feature amalgamation is available at (https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/9842-hurst-exponent).",0,1

"Korean is widely known for its extremely elaborate system of honorification. This paper attempts to capture and articulate Korean cultural scripts about social relationships and associated communicative norms pertinent to the honorific system and in numerous fixed expressions. Relevant components include a “vertical” model of society in which people are commonly thought of as ‘above’ or ‘below’ oneself, a recognised category of revered senior people (Korean noin), and the importance of relative age differences in one-to-one interaction. In addition, the paper tries to articulate the shared understanding behind the existence of honorification as a social practice, namely, that differential usage of words can send specific social messages about how interactants regard each other. The descriptive technique is the cultural scripts approach, using conceptual primes proposed in the Natural Semantic Metalanguage theory. The cultural scripts are presented in both English and Korean metalanguages. The study demonstrates the possibility of describing cultural values and the related communicative norms in simple terms from an insiders' perspective.",0,1

"Although the delta and RASTA methods have been widely used in extracting the temporal properties of stationary features for robust speech recognition, there is still a need to investigate new temporal features for better performance. In this paper, we present two new temporal features for robust processing of speech signals with emphasis on microphone variations. First, the temporal feature is derived from a bank of RASTA-like filters, in which the parameters of each filter in this bank are estimated according to the statistical properties of the speech signals. Secondly, a parametrized temporal filter (called a PTF) is proposed. The filter can be described by four parameters: the passband, the beginning transition, the ending transition and the smoothness of the magnitude of the filter response. Together, these parameters determine the magnitude of the frequency response of the PTF, and a transformation algorithm is then used to derive the temporal coefficients with real and causal characteristics. The discriminative ability of the PTF features can be further enhanced using the minimum classification error (MCE) algorithm. Experimental results show that the RASTA features are inferior to the PTF features both in quiet conditions and in the presence of microphone variations.",0,1

"Cough reflex testing evaluates the sensory integrity of the laryngeal cough reflex and has recently been applied for the evaluation of patients with dysphagia. It involves brief nebulization of citric acid through a sterile reservoir, mask, and tubing which are disposed of after use. Nebulizers used for drug delivery or humidification are reported to become contaminated with bacteria, leading to patient colonization and consequently increasing the risk of chest infection. No research has been undertaken to evaluate whether nebulization used for cough reflex testing poses similar threats. This study analyzed whether pathogens colonize in the disposable products used for cough reflex testing in the short duration of usual clinical practice as a component of the clinical swallowing assessment. Samples taken from both ends of the tubing, the reservoir and the mask, pre- and post-nebulization, were smeared onto blood agar plates, then incubated at 37°C in candle jars. After 48 hours the plates were removed and bacterial colonies were counted. No colonies grew from either end of the tubing for any trial. Evidence of bacterial colonization was found in samples from the reservoir and the mask and single-tailed paired t tests were completed for these datasets. For the reservoir and the mask data, there were no significant differences between pre- and post-nebulization bacteria counts. These results suggested that the clinical methods used for cough reflex testing do not result in significant colonization of bacteria on test materials.",0,1
"This paper presents a novel ''pseudo-one-mass model'' of the vocal folds, which is derived from a previously proposed two-mass model. Two-mass models account for effects of vertical phase differences in fold motion by means of a pair of coupled oscillators that describe the lower and upper fold portions. Instead, the proposed model employs a single mass-spring oscillator to describe only the oscillation of the lower fold portion, while phase difference effects are simulated through an approximate phenomenological description of the upper glottal area. This approximate description is derived in the hypothesis that 1:1 modal entrainment occurs between the two masses in the large-amplitude oscillation regime, and is then exploited to derive the equations of the pseudo-one-mass model. Numerical simulations of a reference two-mass model are analyzed to show that the proposed approximation remains valid when values of the physical parameters are varied in a large region of the control space. The effects on the shape of the glottal flow pulse are also analyzed. Comparison of simulations with the reference two-mass model and the pseudo-one-mass model show that the dynamic behavior of the former is accurately approximated by the latter. The similarity of flow signals synthesized with the two models is assessed in terms of four acoustic parameters: fundamental frequency, maximum amplitude, open quotient, and speed quotient. The results confirm that the pseudo-one-mass model fit with good accuracy the behavior of the reference two-mass model, while requiring significantly lower computational resources and roughly half of the mechanical parameters.",0,1

"On the basis of experimental evidence this paper shows that in Serbian pre-nominal possessive modifiers modifying a noun phrase in subject position can be interpreted as coreferential with a clitic or a strong pronoun in object position. This finding speaks against a condition B violation in these contexts as has been assumed in previous analyses of Serbian (cf. Despić 2013). It implies that possessive noun phrases in article-languages like English and articleless languages like Serbian may receive a parallel analysis (Universal DP hypothesis, Bašić 2004; Progovac 1998): in both languages, the modifier occupies a position in the noun phrase structure from where it does not c-command out of the noun phrase, leading to free covaluation in these contexts (cf. Reinhart 2006). Interestingly, clitics are more likely than strong pronouns to be interpreted as coreferential with the possessive modifier in our test. This may be attributed to the fact that clitic forms in general are more easily bound in non-c-command configurations. In addition, the discourse conditions in the test, where the possessor represented given information, could have contributed to the fact that it was more likely associated with a clitic than with a strong pronoun.",0,1

"This book presents a theoretical and methodological approach to specialized lexicography defined by the authors as ‘the branch of lexicography concerned with the theory and practice of specialised dictionaries, i.e. dictionaries, encyclopaedias, lexica, glossaries, vocabularies, and other information tools covering areas outside general and cultural knowledge and the corresponding Language for General Purposes (LGP); it represents mainly, but not exclusively, disciplines related to technology, industry, trade, economic life, law, natural and social sciences, and humanities.’ (p. 7) The focus has been placed on electronic specialized lexicography and online resources but part of the ideas and principles presented can be applied to printed media. The approach taken is deeply rooted in the function theory of lexicography that will be briefly described below. The first author, Pedro Fuertes-Olivera, professor at the University of Valladolid (Spain), has applied the function theory to specialized lexicographical projects and is the author or editor of other books on specialized lexicography (Fuertes-Olivera 2010; Fuertes-Olivera and Arribas-Baño 2008); the second author, Sven Tarp, professor at the University of Aarhus (Denmark), is also a lexicographer and is the main advocate of the function theory (Tarp 2008).",0,1
"Abstract This new study of two bilingual inscriptions from Tamassos (ICS 265; ICS 215) provides information on the political status of this Cypriot city-state in the fourth century BC. In these years, Tamassos had remained independent, before king Pasikypros sold it to Pummayaton king of Kition (Duris, FGrH (BNJ) 76 F 4). Language and content of the bilingual texts are analysed and a few changes are made as compared to the previous editions. The inscriptions’ dating formulas with the name of king Milkyaton, king of Kition, provide evidence of the presence of Kitians in Tamassos already in the decades before the sale. Although Tamassos was landlocked and did not have a harbour, it may have entered into trade agreements with Kition in order to use its port to export copper productions. This may have laid the foundations for the future sale.",0,1
"Reviewed by: Issues in formal German(ic) typology ed. by Werner Abraham, and C. JanWouter Zwart Kleanthes K. Grohmann Issues in formal German(ic) typology. Ed. by Werner Abraham and C. JanWouter Zwart. (Linguistik aktuell/Linguistics today 45.) Amsterdam: John Benjamins, 2002. Pp. xvii, 334. ISBN 1588111024. $110 (Hb). As Werner Abraham frames it in his ‘Introduction’ (ix–xvii), this volume ‘focuses on German and its closest linguistic relatives, English and Scandinavia [in languages] both genetically and areally’ (ix). As such, the present collection of papers fits one part of the premise of its title well: ‘German(ic) typology’. The ‘formal’ part of the premise concerns the treatment of the various ‘issues’ discussed and, as can be expected from the ‘blue series’, offers the latest in generative theorizing applied to a number of Germanic languages and dialects. Abraham identifies a coherence in the articles regarding content, and the contributors investigate this coherence from syntactic and semantic angles throughout, as the one-sentence summaries below illustrate. The collection revolves around two issues that set German apart from its genetic and areal relatives yet allow in-depth comparisons on the search for explanations. On the one hand, German displays a distinct discourse-prominence, setting it apart from the other Germanic languages (viz. scrambling, refocusing, and issues dealing with theme/rheme discourse functions). On the other hand, it allows considerable freedom in passivization, which can take place irrespective of transitivity and aspectual constraints as long as the predicate is agentive (yielding obligatory insertion of an expletive when intransitives are passivized to satisfy the verb-second constraint). If all contributions do indeed deal with these two issues, the majority of articles arguably falls into the first class. Werner Abraham and László Molnárfi investigate ‘German clause structure under discourse functional weight: Focus and antifocus’ (1–43) and propose an ‘accent-syntax’ by linking theme/rheme to the clausal structure on the basis of systematic clause-accent distribution. In ‘Reconsidering identificational focus’ (65–84), Jocelyn Cohan proposes to derive two core properties of identificational focus, exhaustiveness and contract, rather than positing them as inherent properties; she bases her investigation on recordings from spontaneous spoken English. Britta Jensen studies ‘Polarity items in English and Danish’ (127–40), first comparing polarity items in these two languages and then offering a licensing proposal that involves feature checking and a locality constraint. Jürgen Lenerz connects ‘Scrambling and reference in German’ (179–92), critically inspecting the oft-voiced constraint that indefinites in German do not scramble and replacing this too strong generalization by capitalizing on referential properties of indefinites. Enrique Mallen investigates ‘Attributive adjectives in Germanic and Romance’ (193–222) and proposes a uniform analysis in which attributive adjectives are maximal projections in the nominal specifier projection, in Germanic the highest and in Romance the lowest NP of a multiple NP-shell. In the only German-language contribution to this volume, ‘Die Negationsklammer im Afrikaans—Mehrfachnegation aus formaler und funktionaler Sicht’ (223–61), László Molnárfi proposes that multiple negation in Afrikaans is not only subject to a Neg-Criterion but also involves the minimal lexical identification of functional domains. John te Velde considers ‘Phases in the derivation of elliptical coordinate constructions’ (307–29) and proposes a derivational analysis of common forms of ellipsis in English and German, integrating recent developments in minimalist theorizing, in particular the distinction between pure merge on one hand and merge and move on the other. The other third of the articles fall into the above-mentioned second class of issues addressed and issues related to this property. Cedric Boeckx reflects ‘On the co-occurrence of expletives and definite subjects in Germanic’ (45–64) and replaces traditional accounts of the ‘definiteness effect’ (which does not hold equally among the Germanic dialects) with a minimalist analysis, derived from independently motivated lexical parameters. Christine Czinglar’s ‘Decomposing existence: Evidence from Germanic’ (85–126) deals with impersonal existential constructions in German and Scandinavian languages and divides these into ‘locative’ and ‘pure’ existentials, a distinction she demonstrates to hold crosslinguistically and which she supports (syntactically and semantically) within a neat...",0,1
"The main title of this work might be a bit misleading, because it creates the impression that a very wide and general topic will be discussed. The subtitle, however, is much more to the point, since the author specifically investigates English and French monolingual dictionaries in view of certain aspects. The author makes it clear (2001: 210) that she does not want to describe general ""influences"" of a socio-cultural nature on the contents of dictionaries, but rather how socio-cultural trends and traditions had an impact on the methodological aspects of lexicography in Britain and France. This means that generalisation for other languages will only be possible after further in-depth studies.",0,1
"The domain of money and finance is frequently represented in Spanish by terms drawn from the semantic fields of the three states of matter: solid, liquid, and gas. That material metaphors describe money is demonstrated by such terms as suma redonda, 'round sum' (solid); flujo de capital, flow of capital (liquid); and inflacion, inflation (gas). Solids are associated with long-term security and indivisibility; liquid, with transferability and instancy of access; and gas, with uncontainability, unpredictability, and loss.",0,1
"This study explored how language proficiency influences the Stroop effect and the reverse-Stroop effect. The result indicated that both the Stroop effect and the reverse-Stroop effect in the dominant language context were greater than the effects in the non-dominant language context, respectively. However, language proficiency influenced the two effects with different mechanisms. The influence of language proficiency both on the Stroop effect and on the reverse-Stroop effect is associated with the processing automaticity of the distractor and the binding between target and distractor. However, the two factors act synergistically in the Stroop test, whereas antagonistically in the reverse-Stroop test. The results also suggest that the non-dominant language is relatively harder to attract attention. While once it catches attention, the attention will be in a state of high concentration and poor flexibility. Hence, in term of the non-dominant language, it is neither easy to cause interference nor easy to be interfered. It seems that the difference between the downward interference and the upward interference has a slight impact on the conflict resolution, whereas the binding of different information has a greater impact. Additionally, the left DLPFC and the right DLPFC were found to play different roles in the bilingual color-word tests. The connection on the right DLPFC and the left DLPFC was more sensitive to the difference between languages and to the difference between tasks, respectively.",0,1

"Little empirical research has focused on what people say that triggers the salience of age for older adults, let alone for other age groupings. In this study, 570 American respondents (young adult, middle-aged, and older adult) wrote about events that made them “feel my age,” “feel younger,” and “feel older” and also rated the frequency and valence of these events. This generated many thousands of expressed events that coders subsumed under 28 generic categories. Very different patterns of age salience emerged for the three generations. Among these, “feeling younger” was rated as less frequent and favorably by young adults, but much more positively by the two samples of older adults. The latter rated “feeling older” less positively than the younger sample, especially the older group who rated it negatively. There was some overlap between events that triggered “feeling my age” and “feeling older,” most of which were associated with physical and cognitive decline for the two older samples. The findings were discussed and future research directions indicated.",0,1
"BOOK NOTICES 205 retical topics addressed but are loosely united in their attempt to ask how well current versions of generative theory (either the principles and parameters framework or the minimalist program) fare in their treatment of linguistic phenomena in different languages . The emphasis of the volume rests far more on adjusting the apparatus of generative theory than attempting to discover the full range ofrelevant typological variation. As a whole, however, the book asks intriguing questions about how differences between languages might be unified with the proper syntactic theory. Hubert Haider (17-33) addresses the issue of head-complement ordering. He provides a number of empirical problems for the position promoted in recent years by Richard Kayne and Noam Chomsky. He offers an alternative view which generates verbs on the periphery of clause structure and then moves the verb, rather than its nominal arguments, to achieve the surface order of basic constituents. Anoop Mahajan (35-57) demonstrates that ergative case marking correlates with two other linguistic properties. First, an ergative system is restricted to verb peripheral languages. Second, ergative languages typically lack a distinct verb have. Mahajan proposes that the correlations are derivable from a deeper organizing principle of grammar. Specifically , he argues that the auxiliary verb have is actually an oblique form of the verb be and is created by adposition incorporation. In certain languages, the incorporation is blocked, so have cannot be derived. In these cases the adposition arises either as an ergative particle or affix. Chris Wilder (59-107) supplies an overview of ellipsis phenomena in English coordination. He identifies two primary types of ellipsis—backward and forward—and demonstrates constraints on their formation . He provides several arguments that ellipsis structures are not created by movement but rather are produced by phonologically empty elements generated at deep structure. David Adger (109-34) examines how the structural position of weak quantifiers is involved in their interpretation. Using data from Germanic languages and Scottish Gaelic, he suggests that the interpretation of certain weak quantifiers is accomplished by lowering at LF and that the lowering is governed by a restriction on derivations called effability. M. Rita Manzini (135-53) elaborates on her previous work on the notion of locality. She argues that all movement is subject to the same restrictions, essentially operating between adjacent minimal domains . This conception differs from work on relativized minimality which treats adjunct WH-movement distinctly from argument WH-movement. Manzini employs evidence from English WH-movement as well as polarity items in Italian and Albanian to exemplify how her definition of locality can unify various sorts of dependencies. Paul Law (155-79) focuses on subject/object asymmetries in Malagasy, which are seemingly opposite of what one finds in English. Law accounts for the Malagasy facts in terms ofageneral constraint on argument binding and justifies the constraint by demonstrating that it also accounts for a correlation between voice morphology and word order. Since Malagasy manifests a basic VOS constituent structure and has a three-way voice distinction (active vs. passive vs. circumstantial), both of which are typologically unusual, Law's article is particularly effective in pointing out types of variation that are not easy to account for undercurrent assumptions in generative theory. Elly van Gelderen (181-96) argues that there are strong features in AgrO which must be checked in the course of a derivation, either by an NP or by an expletive. She offers evidence from French, other Romance languages, Germanic, and Indie to support her claim. She also briefly raises the utility of her account for agreement in Uto-Aztecan but concedes that it only works well for languages like Hopi which have a relatively fixed word order. Jamal Ouhalla (197-218) discusses genitive subjects in Berber. He proposes that such subjects arise in clauses which contain the functional projection AGRgen whereas nominative subjects arise in clauses which lack this feature. In order to avoid complete circularity in his argument, he identifies certain word order facts which also receive some account under this analysis. Finally, Gaberell Drachman (219-48) argues that the syntactic properties of clitics provide evidence for different projections in clause structure: operator projections, agreement projections, and lexical projections. His primary evidence...",0,1
"Liberia is situated on the Pepper Coast of West Africa, some six degrees north of the equator opposite the northeastern coast of South America, and represents the last of four attempts to establish African homelands for freed slaves from the Americas.2 The first three, in 1811, 1815 and 1820-21, were unsuccessful because of ill health among the colonists and lack of adequate funds. The attempt at settlement made by the American Colonization Society in late 1821, however, proved to be successful, and with the gradual purchase of more and more land in the Mesurado River area, the colony grew. By the time of the Confederate War in this country, over 1 1,000 Afro-Americans had been established in Liberia.",0,1

"Investigating dictionary use is not only essential to the process of dictionary compilation and evaluation but equally to establishing a best practice of strategic dictionary consultation. User research of the past few decades has tended to focus either on pedagogical lexicography or the evaluation of specific lexicographic resources. In particular, the proportion of investigations in specialised settings seems comparatively low. In order to redress the balance, the present study evaluates the resource selection process and consultation strategies of 430 L2 learners of five languages studying university courses in business and economics. Data were gathered by a three-tiered method combining a self-report questionnaire, a text production and translation test with observation, and guided interviews. The study’s results suggest a general lack of awareness of existing specialised resources and alternative strategies for handling specialised texts.",0,1

"The New Zealand accent belongs to the British group of English accents. There are three main divisions: General New Zealand, which is spoken in most parts of the country, and the accents of Otago, in the south of the South Island, and on the West Coast of the South Island. The three divisions follow the original pattern of settlement. In the North Island, settlement was directed by the New Zealand Company, which founded Auckland and Wellington in 1840; other settlements followed in the late 1840s. In the South, the Anglican Church founded Christchurch and Nelson in the early 1850s. These settlements had the common aim of reproducing English society as it existed in the south of England and drew most of their settlers from persons dispossessed by the Industrial Revolution. The difficulties of life in early New Zealand effectively levelled out social differences, with important effects on the language. Otago was founded in 1848 by the Scottish Free Church. The West Coast was not settled until the Gold Rush of the 1860s attracted miners from the goldfields of Victoria and California. Since that time there has been considerable immigration from the British Isles, at first a mere trickle from Europe and then a flood of Central European refugees after the Second World War. In general the willingness of the average New Zealander to travel for reasons of work or promotion has prevented the growth of regional accents; but the West Coast and Otago tend to keep to themselves, isolated by rough country and their own sense of community.",0,1

"Any glo bally circulating piece of research that flags up a particular national-language context as its centre of attention is bound to raise a twofold expectation in this day and age: To discuss a specific state of affairs in a particular language/society, and to use this as a case in point to cast light on wider theoretical, methodological or empirical issues. The contributions to this issue take their cue from recent sociolinguistics and discourse studies to address aspects of Greek language and discourse, culture and identity in Greece, Cyprus, and the Greek diaspora. In reflecting on the preceding four papers, I shall be asking what they tell us as about Greek and Greekness, whether this Greekness is made relevant as discursive process or interpretive motif, and also how these Greek cases may contribute to our understanding of wider processes of language, society, identity and communication technologies.",0,1
"This article examines the historical, institutional, and interactional processes by which “Poly” (i.e., Polynesian) has come to be understood as a race and language within a context in the California Bay Area. Rather than understanding “races” as discrete categories—as well as sociolinguistic features as permanently attributable and patterned to specific racialized groups—I argue that racialization is ever‐changing and rooted in power relations that are (re)produced from interaction to interaction, and moment to moment. I primarily draw upon a semi‐structured interview with a Tongan young woman (“Maklea”), and more broadly ethnographic research conducted within her local language context, and argue that a racialized Polyness (i.e., Polynesianness) is becoming raciolinguistically enregistered due to experiences with White supremacy and processes of colonialism. That is, Polyness is in the process of being rendered mutually perceivable as a racial category and coherent set of semiotic practices as Polynesian diasporic peoples in this community are confronting policing, gentrification, and an ideology of oppressionlessness. The raciolinguistic enregisterment of Polyness is occurring as Maklea, and more broadly Polynesian young people, are grappling with and challenging the ways White supremacist institutions and systems are seeking to violently structure their lives and ways of knowing, being, valuing, and speaking.",0,1
"This paper examines the true nature of the reduplicant vowels in the two major types of reduplication in Truku, Cə- reduplication and CəCə- reduplication, which have been previously assumed to involve monosyllabic and disyllabic copying, respectively. The reduplicants of the two patterns (i.e., Cə- and CəCə-) contain schwas that are always considered as reduced vowels derived from the pretonic vowel reduction rule. Drawing evidence from three types of reduplication forms that have not been previously noticed/documented, that is, reduplication forms showing CəC- ∼CəCə- variation, as well as reduplication taking place on monosyllabic words and on CV.ʔ- initial words, this paper argues that the schwas in the reduplicants of the two reduplication patterns do not always come from vowel reduction. Although the first schwa in the CəCə-reduplicant does come from vowel reduction, the final schwas in the CəCə- and Cə- reduplicant are actually inserted vowels that function to break up CC clusters. The findings also show that Cə- reduplication only copies consonants from the Base. Therefore, Truku, just as Squliq Atayal, also involves bare consonant copying.",0,1

"Thermosetting resins (TR) are organic compounds that form rigid solid polymers that under heating, decompose with no plastic state or melting. Such an aspect is useful for their application in refractory systems. Despite their technological importance, few works have systemically discussed how TR composition and molecular architecture, the curing conditions and the presence of additives influence the properties of carbon-containing refractories after pyrolysis, graphitization and sintering processes. The present paper review the benefits and drawbacks of applying TR to produce carbon-containing refractories. The first sections present general aspects of TR synthesis and chemical modification. The influence of the processing conditions, raw materials and additives on the pyrolysis of organic material, carbon yield generation and phase transformations are discussed. Additionally, important aspects about toxicity and safety issues of several types of TR, the use of different grades attained from sustainable raw materials, and future challenges for TR-bonded refractories’ production are pointed out.",0,1
"Abstract We review a new perspective for analyzing linguistic variation, diffusion, and change, by introducing into this ‘arena’ the economists' perception of strategic individual interactions. We invoke basic game theory principles to explain linguistic outcomes of individual speech production in a variety of interactional social settings. We present real‐life examples that illustrate our game perspective regarding linguistic interactions and present a number of mappings into well‐known game constructs such as the Prisoners' Dilemma, iterated dominance, and extensive form games. Our purpose is to suggest a game theory ‘prism’ as a plausible methodology for analysis of individual interactional linguistic situations.",0,1

"The eagerly awaited revision of the Association's Principles will no doubt incorporate a less controversial statement than the present (paragraph 11) remark that THE positions of THE tongue in the articulation of cardinal [i, a, α] and [u] have been determined . The old form of diagram introduced by Daniel Jones, and still surviving as the only official IPA shape must surely be now discarded. Its form implied excessive optimism both about the universality of the applicability of the X-ray photography data on which it was based, and about its practical usefulness. It can only be said to have flourished for about the decade 1919–29. Since the early ‘thirties it has been overwhelmingly rejected in favour of Jones's second choice, which many would perhaps be surprised to hear has as yet absolutely no explicit official IPA sanction. This seems to have first appeared in 1929 in Ida Ward's The Phonetics of English . Jones himself never made use of the present official IPA diagram in any new or fully re-written book after 1932 not even in The Phoneme . So far as one knows he never formally abandoned it but his discarding of it seems to leave little doubt that he himself would have been in sympathy with authorization in the new edition of the de facto current version. If anyone still considers the older version preferable it would be very interesting to hear their arguments and to hear of any evidence on the basis of which such an opinion were held. Now is clearly the time for speaking up on this topic.",0,1
"This volume brings together a revised selection of papers presented at the Workshop ‘Wright's English Dialect Dictionary and Beyond’ convened by the editors and Alexander Onysko at the 15th International Conference on English Historical Linguistics (Munich, August 2008). The Workshop was an initiative of the research project SPEED (Spoken English in Early Dialects) in Innsbruck, whose main purpose is to produce an electronic version of Joseph Wright's English Dialect Dictionary (1898–1905) (henceforth EDD) that enables research into this lexicographic milestone. Published on completion of the initial stage of the project, this book is the first comprehensive approach to Wright's masterpiece, with sixteen contributions by established and young scholars that put the dictionary, its electronic version and its unearthed linguistic treasures in the very centre of interest. The chapters are preceded by a Preface by the editors in which the rationale of the project and the organisation of the book are presented. They are arranged into three themed sections reporting on the genesis of the EDD, its structure, and what has come after it.

"Bilinguals have been shown to differ from monolinguals especially in the realization and interpretation of phenomena that operate at the syntax/discourse interface. Hungarian has a well-known interface structure—identificational focus—which has been widely studied in the theoretical literature but never with bilinguals. The present article fills that gap, using three acceptability judgment experiments to test the realization and interpretation of identificational focus by heritage speakers and L1-dominant native speakers of Hungarian. The results reveal that both groups pattern similarly, showing some vulnerability at the syntax/discourse interface with regard to focus interpretation but less so with its realization. Further, the findings bear on the description of Hungarian focus in the theoretical literature, providing experimental evidence that focus is realized preverbally and that its interpretation is the result of a pragmatic implicature rather than part of the sentence’s semantics.",0,1
"Text comprehension involves the ability to understand how texts relate to the situation they describe and to each other (i.e., a Document model). Research into Document models has emphasized the role of information sources in structuring readers’ mental models of situations. The present article reviews research on source comprehension and examines new hypotheses regarding source encoding during text comprehension. Two experiments examined college students’ evaluation and recognition of two embedded sources as a function of the consistency of their statements (Experiments 1 and 2) and the demands of the reading task (Experiment 2). Sources were introduced either with a knowledge feature (e.g., how the source knew what they knew) or a control feature. Readers were more likely to select the knowledgeable source as more competent and to justify their selection by referring to the knowledge feature (Experiment 1). Experiment 2 found that readers’ preference for knowledgeable sources was stronger when the content statements were discrepant. Preference for knowledgeable sources was also stronger when the task focused on source knowledge, as compared to a control evaluation task or a baseline reading task. The source knowledge evaluation task distinctively enhanced participants’ integration of the source designations with their respective statements, as compared to the control and baseline conditions. Results are discussed in light of current theories of single and multiple document comprehension.",0,1
"This paper proposes a scalar analysis of polysemy of Russian verbal prefixes. The lexical entry remains constant throughout all uses of a given prefix: it relates the event, denoted by the prefixed verb, to a scale. The specific kind of transition denoted by the prefix is the source of the similarities in meaning. The structure, into which the prefix is inserted, varies and determines the scale along which the event is measured out, which may be a path (with verbs of motion), a scale of change, or the temporal trace of the event. It is demonstrated that the semantic differences go hand in hand with structural differences and that the meaning of a prefix is predictable based on the event structure of the verb it attaches to. If the verb lexicalizes a scale of change, the prefix must measure out the result, mapping the event onto a scale, which is the complement of the result. If the verb contains conflated material and is incompatible with a result, the only available position is above aspect, where the superlexical prefix measures out the time of the event. A direct object may serve either as the resultee undergoing a change of state or as the measuring scale (as in the case of spatial and consumption verbs). Many verbs are flexible, and then the prefix may take on different meanings and the structure depends on whether the event is interpreted as involving a change of state or an unbounded activity.",0,1
"The reproduction of culture in dictionaries constitutes one of the fundamental prob-lems of lexicographers today. What is the nature of cultural data in dictionaries? To what extent should cultural aspects be transferred from one language to another? How should this transfer take place? This article attempts to discuss the relevance of the reproduction of Gabonese cultural aspects in dictionaries in French and the Gabonese languages. One of the main problems the compilers of these dictionaries encountered was the transfer and the translation of some cultural aspects. In order to discuss the nature and extent of cultural information in Gabonese dictionaries, this article will restrict itself to the following points: — The translation of different realities — The role of culture in the change of meaning — Dictionaries and cultural activities — Dictionaries and cultural ethics — Dictionaries and language registers — Dictionaries and culture maintenance — Dictionaries and the standardization of culture Prior to a discussion of the above-mentioned points, a brief description of the dictionaries investi-gated will be given. After a description of the influence of cultural contexts on lexicographers in the choice of macrostructural elements and their treatment, cultural differences between source and target languages in the dictionaries of Gabonese languages are discussed. The article concludes with the observation that the majority of existing lexicographic works tend to survey the full vocabulary of the language. The lexicographic treatment of some words is satisfactory because an account of the underlying worldview of the people is given. For example, in this article, the fol-lowing themes are considered: dietary practices, sexuality, mythology, traditional pharmacopoeia, the kinship system, hospitality, and respect for traditional authority and elders. However, to be used in the most efficient way, these lexicographic publications need to be revised. Keywords: culture, dictionaries, target user, translation, cultural",0,1
"The gender relations of power embedded within the urban landscape and materialized in street nomenclature remain an underexplored topic in place-name studies. This paper situates the gendered spaces of street names within the broader investigation of identity politics played out in the public space. Drawing on scholarship from “critical toponymies”, this article diachronically examines the gender patterning of urban nomenclature in a city from Eastern Europe (Sibiu, formerly Hermannstadt, Romania). For this purpose, a dataset was compiled from the entire street nomenclature of the city across seven successive historical periods, from 1875 to 2020 (n = 2,766). The statistical analyses performed on this dataset revealed a “masculine default” as a structuring principle underpinning Sibiu’s urban namescape for the two centuries investigated. As this analysis demonstrates, contrary to the overall democratization of the Romanian post-socialist society, Sibiu’s streetscape continues to tell a patriarchal story informed by hegemonic masculinity.",0,1

"The pediatric population with dysphagia is diverse, ranging from premature infants to fully grown adolescents. A variety of medical conditions cause swallowing disorders in pediatric patients. Complications of swallowing disorders can have severe and even fatal consequences. Swallowing disorders have a direct impact on nutrition, and adequate nutrition is required for growth and development of all body systems in infants and children. Infants and children may not have the same symptoms and signs as adults with dysphagia do and learning to identify pediatric patients at risk for dysphagia is critical. The diagnosis must be thorough and accurate. Furthermore, management of swallowing disorders and nutrition must be aggressive and immediate because of the reduced nutritional reserve and high needs of the infant and child. This article discusses the following three areas for optimal care: identification of infants and children at risk for dysphagia, diagnostic procedures, and management.",0,1
"The requirements of evidence-based practice in 2017 are motivating new theoretical foundations and methodological tools for characterizing neonatal feeding behavior. Toward that end, this article offers a complex dynamical systems perspective. A set of critical concepts from this perspective frames challenges faced by speech-language pathologists and allied professionals: when to initiate oral feeds, how to determine the robustness of neonatal breathing during feeding and appropriate levels of respiratory support, what instrumental assessments of swallow function to use with preterm neonates, and whether or not to introduce thickened liquids. In the near future, we can expect vast amounts of new data to guide evidence-based practice. But unless practitioners are able to frame these issues in a systems context larger than the individual child, the availability of ""big data"" will not be effectively translated to clinical practice.",0,1

"On a toujours considéré, semble-t-il, que la nasalisation vocalique régressive procède habituellement par étapes, c’est-à-dire que certaines voyelles se font nasaliser avant d’autres, soit à cause de leur nature même ou à cause du contexte plus ou moins propice dans lequel elles se trouvent. Or, voici qu’après avoir effectué une étude exhaustive sur le développement des voyelles nasales, George Entenman en est arrivé récemment à la conclusion tout à fait opposée. Son hypothèse peut se résumer ainsi: “A language cannot nasalize some vowels before nasal consonants without nasalizing all vowels in this environment” (1977:1). C’est ce qu’il a baptisé le principe “tout ou rien” (the “all-or-nothing” principle) . Bien que les arguments qu’il présente en faveur de ce principe semblent en général solides et bien motivés, je vais tenter de démontrer qu’il y en a un d’entre eux qui s’effondre complètement. L’argument en question découle d’une tentative de rendre compte d’un phénomène de toute évidence phonologique, à savoir la dénasalisation vocalique en français, en des termes morphologiques. Avant d’aborder ce problème particulier, cependant, il est essentiel de le situer dans le contexte de sa théorie.",0,1
"Una de las principales dificultades en el estudio de los llamados «marcadores conversacionales» (Martin Zorraquino y Portoles 1999) es su marcado caracter polifuncional.

Analogic change can be defined as a process whereby one form of the language becomes more like another with which it is associated. Analogic change is a synchronic and a diachronic process which operates on the following levels: (1) a redistribution or simplification of coallomorphs; (2) a replacement whether it is grammatical or semantic or some kind of association; and (3) rule levelling and rule extension. The interdependence between sound change and analogic change has been explained because of the mutual effect; sound change is regular and produces irregularities; analogy is irregular and causes regularity.,0,1
"On comparative concepts and descriptive categories: A reply to Haspelmath Frederick J. Newmeyer In his discussion note (Haspelmath 2010), Martin Haspelmath (henceforth ‘H’) proposes a radical disconnect between the grammatical analyses of individual languages and crosslinguistic (typological) generalizations about grammatical patterning: ‘The analysis of particular languages and the comparison of languages are thus independent of each other as theoretical enterprises’ (p. 682). In an earlier publication (Haspelmath 2007), H had argued, along with Dryer (1996, 1997), Croft (2001), and others, that it is impossible to provide unambiguous and reliable tests for identifying a particular grammatical entity in one language (‘subject’, ‘noun’, ‘dative’, or whatever) as being ‘the same construct’ as in another language. Hence, ‘[e]ach language has its own categories, … [which] are often similar across languages, but the similarities and differences between languages cannot be captured by equating categories across languages’ (p. 664). In his view, typology is carried out by means of universally applicable ‘comparative concepts’, which include conceptual-semantic concepts, general formal concepts such as ‘precede’, ‘identical’, and ‘overt’ (which he assumes ‘to be unproblematic’, p. 670), and other comparative concepts. Interestingly, H claims that ‘in practice typologists generally work with such special comparative concepts’ (p. 663), an assertion that applies equally to generative typologists, who ‘have in practice used comparative concepts, rather than crosslinguistic categories whose instantiations in individual languages are well motivated’ (p. 676). I argue below that universal comparative concepts and language-particular descriptive categories are each highly problematic in and of themselves. It is only by means of working out the interplay between the language-particular and the language-independent that we can hope to understand either. This is just the sort of interplay that H steadfastly rejects. The great irony is that the more successful H is at proposing a set of useful comparative concepts, the more he undercuts his assertion that they ‘cannot be right or wrong’, but can ‘only be more or less productive’ (p. 678). If the comparative concepts that enter into a typological generalization are ‘productive’, then we want to know why they are productive. The answer might possibly be due to an innate universal grammar (UG), or possibly be a consequence of a complex interplay of cognitive and functional factors. But there has to be an answer—productive hypotheses and lines of research derive their productivity from the fact that they shed light on the essential nature of the phenomena being investigated, while nonproductive hypotheses and lines of research do not do so. In simple terms, a productive hypothesis is closer to being right than a nonproductive one. H’s outlook reminds me of that of the post-Bloomfieldian linguists of the 1940s and 1950s. They insisted that their procedures for linguistic analysis were arbitrary, yet, as Chomsky and Halle pointed out in many publications, they were careful to choose only those procedures that led to results that were revealing about how grammars actually work. Their practice was better than their theory, as I would argue is the case for H. H devotes space in his discussion note to repeating arguments that Subject is not a crosslinguistic category. The problem, as H sees it, is that subjects in English are not definable by the same criteria as subjects in Tagalog, which are not definable by the same [End Page 688] criteria as subjects in whatever other language one might name. Since the criteria devised for identifying subjects differ from language to language, we need to ‘[return] to the structuralist position that each language has its own categories and that there are no crosslinguistic categories’ (p. 667).And yet, two of his typological generalizations—one about adjective order (p. 670) and one involving reflexive pronouns (p. 673)—refer to the notion ‘subject’ (and one of them refers to the notion ‘object’ as well). I see no way to avoid the conclusion that H is guilty of extreme inconsistency. If H is correct that no single criterion identifies subjects crosslinguistically, then how can he go ahead and formulate such a criterion, which he must do in order to capture the two generalizations referred to above? Here and elsewhere, H undermines his own position that there is a total disconnect...",0,1
"Although emotions are pervasive phenomena in human experience, their study in the linguistic and social sciences has been relatively neglected until recently. They have been difficult to define and measure. In experimental contexts, their free expression is limited, and in naturalistic studies, their often fleeting and subtle expression has been difficult to capture and record for subsequent analysis. Some recent progress, however, has been made. A summarizing definition of emotions is presented and prototypical emotions are identified, building on the differential emotions theory of Izard and the psychoevolutionary theory of emotions by Plutchik. Emotions serve internal regulatory functions for individuals, and their expression, reflective of internal state, are adaptive within a social framework through their communicative value for members. The ontogeny of the emotions as expressed facially and vocally is summarized in terms of major findings to date, and a model for research on ontogenetic development is proposed. The model relies on Sroufe's concept of tension — environmentally related cumulative arousal in an infant — and emphasizes the role of caretaker behavior in the modulation of tension. Engagement of an infant in social interaction assists in tension regulation and the development of positive and negative affect associated with the regulation. In the interactional contexts, caretakers express emotions facially and vocally, which serves a dual purpose of attracting an infant's attention such that interaction can proceed and of providing a model for infant association of expression and emotion.",0,1

"Abstract We provide an update on the state of research on phonation (the production of sound by the vocal folds) since Gordon and Ladefoged's, Journal of Phonetics, 2001 29, 383–406 overview, focusing on the acoustics of breathiness, creak, and other linguistic voice qualities. We highlight cross‐linguistic variation, introduce measuring techniques, and discuss the relationship between phonation and other phonological dimensions (e.g., tone, vowel quality). We also review perceptual literature, an area of phonation research that has greatly expanded recently. Taken together, the studies reviewed demonstrate that phonation types indeed lie not just on a single continuum, but in a multidimensional space.",0,1
"“Radical” templatic phonology is a template-based approach to segmental phonological representation. The central hypothesis is that the segmental phonological structure of words is represented as language-specific phonotactic templates, in the sense used in the developmental literature. Template-based organization of the early lexicon has been identified in children acquiring several different languages. It is the result of a usage-based abstracting or “induction” process based on both babbling practice (phonetic production) and input experience with specific adult phonological patterns. The resulting templates thus constitute patterns that reconcile (or “adapt”) the model provided by target words with the child's own phonetic repertoire of syllables or word shapes — typically extending or building on the forms initially “selected” for first word production, in which adult and child forms show a close match. In adult phonology segment categories — natural classes, or features — are best defined in terms of their occurrence in positions in the templates in individual languages, not as independent universal categories. After reviewing the status of segment categories and their phonetic basis in contemporary phonological theory we present crosslinguistic evidence of pervasive variation in both phonetic realization and phonological distribution patterns, evidence that supports the template construct.",0,1
"It has been claimed that the perceptual accuracy with which people comprehend distal pointing gestures is low. But this claim is at odds with research showing that detection of other indexical signals, e.g., eye gaze, is very accurate. We conducted three experiments to assess people’s detection accuracy of targets of distal pointing gestures, using a paradigm adapted from the study of eye gaze. Pairs of people were seated next to each other. One person pointed at targets among 70 points arranged in a horizontal (Experiment 1) or vertical line (Experiment 2). The other person guessed the target. Bias in detection was substantially less than previously shown (approximately 3° in vertical and horizontal conditions), and comparable to levels of accuracy for eye gaze detection. Furthermore, and contrary to previous research, detection accuracy was lower for peripheral targets than for central ones. Experiment 3 replicated Experiments 1 and 2 within one study and further demonstrated that partial occlusion of the pointing arm (from shoulder to elbow) did not adversely affect accuracy.",0,1
"The most satisfactory method of collecting data concerning speech habits demands that a trained fieldworker conduct personal interviews with representative informants. Since, however, the time and money required for carrying out such interviews are seldom available, the investigator must often turn to less satisfactory but more practicable methods; one of these is the multiple-choice questionnaire of the type used to gather the information for this limited survey of Ontario speech habits. The fundamental weakness of the circulated questionnaire is self-evident: the informant must substitute for the trained field worker and observe his own usage. His success in making reliable observations will depend on his native intelligence and level of education, his understanding of the significance of the survey, and his conscientiousness with regard to answering the questions.",0,1
"RESUME Dans l’objectif de contraster deux sous-genres du roman contemporain, l’article analyse les réalisations lexicales, syntaxiques, sémantiques et discursives de 8 constructions lexico-syntaxiques (CLS) dans un corpus français constitué de romans historiques (HIST) et de romans de littérature blanche (GEN) postérieurs à 1950. Ces unités phraséologiques récurrentes ont été repérées grâce à la technique des ALR développée dans le Lexicoscope, un outil de linguistique de corpus créé pour fouiller des textes. Les 8 CLS retenues pour cette étude interviennent dans (ou initient) une interaction verbale. Notre propos est de démontrer que ces CLS représentent bien des motifs qui occupent des fonctions discursives (FD) précises dans chaque genre sous-romanesque qu’elles permettent de mieux définir. Nous verrons ainsi que ces motifs de l’interaction verbale peuvent occuper des FD narrative, descriptive et pragmatique dans HIST et GEN mais que seule la FD cognitive est représentée dans GEN.",0,1

The core data may now be used as a minimal test set for models of lexical cohesion; we present an example suggesting that models based on mutually exclusive lexical chains will not suffice. In addition, we believe that procedures for revealing and analyzing sub-group patterns of agreement described here may be applied to data collected in other studies of comparable size.",0,1

The aim is to show the use and the process of grammaticalisation of these interjections in both languages. We also demonstrate that they aren&#8217;t simple discursive particles within lexical meaning seeing that it&#8217;s their polysemy that creates most of the problems in translation.

"In this paper a restricted sample of motion imperatives is treated within the framework of discourse representation theory. In order to pave the way for this treatment, the concept of path and linguistic aspects of path connection are discussed. The semantic analysis is then extended in the pragmatic direction: It is shown how semantic inferences may be filtered out via pragmatic considerations. We suggest that a level of execution structure is needed to supplement the level of semantic representation. Motion imperatives are evaluated against maps, and aspects of executability are discussed. It is finally shown how the deontic function of motion imperatives can be fulfilled by texts in the indicative mood and that the criteria of adequacy valid for motion imperatives then have to be met by motion indicatives.",0,1

"This paper analyzes the content of the proceedings of the Language Resources and Evaluation Conference (LREC) over the past 17 years (1998–2014), with the goal of gaining a picture of the LREC community and the topics that are most relevant to the field. We follow the methodology used in similar studies, including the survey of the IEEE ICASSP conference proceedings from 1976 to 1990, the survey of the Association of Computational Linguistics conference proceedings over 50 years, and the survey of the proceedings of the conferences contained in the ISCA Archive over 25 years (1987–2012). We expand on results originally presented at LREC 2014, but include the proceedings of LREC 2014 itself in the study together with an analysis of various citation graphs. We show the evolution over time of the number of papers and authors, including their distribution by gender and affiliation, as well as collaborations and citation patterns among authors and papers, funding sources for reported research, and plagiarism and reuse in LREC papers; results for LREC are compared with similar results for major conferences in related fields. We also consider the evolution of research topics over time and identify the authors who introduced key terms. Finally, we propose and apply a measure of a researcher’s notability and provide the results for LREC authors. The study uses NLP methods that have been published in the corpus considered in the study. In addition to providing a revealing characterization of the LRE community, the study also demonstrates the need for establishing a system for unique identification of authors, papers and other sources to facilitate this type of analysis.",0,1

"In Postmodernism or, the Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism, Fredric Jameson speaks to the legitimacy of the claim that we have entered the postmodern era. He also notes, however, that cultural artifacts often contain elements of a previous social structure while, at the same time, revealing one in its early stages of development. In this article I argue that Montserrat Roig’s 1977 novel, El temps de les cireres, supports Jameson’s premise. Through the motifs of photography and time, Roig not only chronicles some of the significant social changes took place in Barcelona during the 1960s and 1970s, she also conjures up the city’s more remote past for an older generarion that had been denied it, as well as for a younger generation that no longer recognized it. In so doing, her novel not only documents events leading up to Spain’s transition to democracy, it also grapples with the broader historical transition from modernity to postmodernity in Spain.",0,1

The major advantage of this technique, which has been used in medical contexts, is that it is especially geared towards dealing with time as a variable of interest, while it still allows one to look at the effect of several covariates. In this proof-of-concept article, we look at morphological shifts in preterites in Dutch, from 800ad to 2000ad (n = 14,314). This is a well-researched field, allowing us to investigate the performance of the multi-state Markov model.",0,1

"Language and conflict - Selected issues Karol Janicki (2015) London and New York: Palgrave and Macmillan. Pp. xiii + 228. ISBN 978-1-137-38140-8Reviewed by Beatriz ChristinoProfessor at the Department of Foreign Languages of the University of Bergen (Norway), where he has developed the research project 'The language of peace and non-aggression', author of Language misconceived - Arguing for applied cognitive sociolinguistics (2006) and Confusing discourse (2010), Karol Janicki has produced an admirable work with his new book, Language and conflict - Selected issues (2015). Being a well-founded analysis also accessible to the general public (as well as undergraduate students), this volume tackles a central question of linguistic fields like pragmatics, sociolinguistics, and applied linguistics, addressing almost everyone's experience: 'What roles do language and communication play in conflicts?' (p. x).Defined by its author as devoted to 'micro questions' such as 'how the use of certain words or grammatical constructions may allow us to manipulate people, how it may arouse emotions, or how it may lead to unintended confrontation' (p. 5, italics as in the original), the book assumes an enlightening perspective of inquiry on language use. Furthermore, it establishes a dialogue not only with works written by influential linguists (e.g., Lakoff, Fillmore, and Hymes), but also with those produced by other scientists such as Leonard Mlodinow and those belonging to a long philosophical tradition, discussing positions of, among others, Plato, Spinoza, Locke, Schopenhauer, and Voltaire.Its structure is, to a significant degree, responsible for this combination of a work most worthy of respect and a useful guide for whoever is interested in avoiding conflicts by enhancing his/her own linguistic awareness. Each of the volume's eight chapters contains a real story (most of them experienced by the author himself) that works as a meaningful and tangible illustration of the key concepts, followed by a section entitled 'Summary and practical advice'. Readers searching for more information about specific issues can count on the 'Suggestions for further reading' which close each chapter. In addition to that, a two-page glossary (pp. 203-204) clarifies the terminology that may appear challenging to non-specialists.The first chapter deals with the widespread misconception that words and their referents in the real world have a 'natural' connection. As the author demonstrates, it is crucial not to forget that 'words activate concepts in the mind' (p. 16) and that this operation inevitably leads to a different result for each individual since personal experiences diverge. Particularly evident in the very common borderline of non-typical cases and fuzzy situations - which encompass highly abstract concepts - this complex process receives attention throughout this book. In fact, a main idea of this chapter (recurrently reaffirmed and complemented in the following ones) is that 'When we differ and are not aware of it, things may easily go wrong. When we differ and are aware of it, and possibly discuss the differences, we are less likely to get involved in conflict' (p. 16).Describing more precisely the activation of concepts in the human mind corresponds to the topic of the second chapter. It shows us that 'words evoke whole scenarios' (p. 32) and explains that alternative framing makes us imagine and talk about the same thing in different ways. Furthermore, it characterizes various kinds of framing processes: for example, through metaphors such as categorization and binary opposition. The last one, centered on the contrast us vs. them (the enemy), often takes place in the political domain, being particularly conducive to conflict. As far as framing effects are concerned, the author informs us that negation cannot suppress the images evoked by words (something which structures like 'Don't think about an elephant! …",0,1
"When people understand metaphors, irrelevant information must be filtered out; for example, to say that one's lawyer is a shark should not be taken to mean that he or she could breathe underwater. We employed a variant of the independent cue paradigm to determine whether metaphor-irrelevant information is inhibited. Consistent with earlier findings of inhibitory processes in idiom comprehension, we found evidence of inhibition of irrelevant information in metaphor comprehension. We also demonstrated that these inhibitory effects were not attributable to lexical priming per se. Overall, the pattern of data implicates active inhibition as a mechanism for filtering irrelevant information during figurative language comprehension.",0,1
"Can concepts be acquired by testing hypotheses about these concepts? Fodor famously argued that this is not possible. Testing the correct hypothesis would require already possessing the concept. I argue that this does not generally hold for mathematical concepts. I discuss specific, empirically motivated, hypotheses for number concepts that can be tested without needing to possess the relevant number concepts. I also argue that one can test hypotheses about the identity conditions of other mathematical concepts, and then fix the application conditions based on those hypotheses—under the assumption that the neo‐logicist view on abstraction principles is correct.",0,1

"What do we mean when we talk about “multilingual voice” in the post-apartheid sociolinguistic context of South Africa? In this paper, I explore this question by reporting on an ethnographic fieldwork project that involved the participant-observation of Rastafarian-herbalists trading goods in an informal marketplace. I focus in the paper on Rastafarian-herbalists’ language practices and participation in ideological debates surrounding the ethics of Rastafarian religious practices as they navigate the complex yet regimented linguistic landscape of the informal marketplace in which they trade their goods. Furthermore, I explore in the paper how the marginalized trading lives of the Rastafarian-herbalists are characterized by the daily negotiation of power and diversity discourses as they try to define their voices. Their engagement with diverse multilingual populations, I argue, not only provides them with excellent opportunities to expand their multilingual repertoires, but also teaches them to manage strategically “multilingual voices” in interaction in order to sell their products. I argue further that although we cannot take stock of all types of marginalization, we should develop sociolinguistic approaches that are not only sympathetic to the marginalization of people and languages in the everyday, but also attune our methodologies to accurately capture experiences in small places such as the ones where Rastafarian-herbalists trade.",0,1
"Vocal indicators of psychoactive drug effects were investigated in two experiments with normal subjects. In the first study antidepressants were administered, and in the second antihypertonics. Speech samples were collected at different stages during medication. Based on the known muscle-relaxing effect of these drugs, a decrease in average fundamental frequency (F0) and an increase in the proportion of spectral energy below 500 Hz (LFR) were expected. LFR showed the expected effect in both experiments. F0, on the other hand, only decreased in the first experiment, while in the second it showed a slight tendency to increase. The suitability of these two measures as indicators of emotional state is discussed. In zwei Experimenten wurde an normalen Versuchpersonen die Wirkung psychoaktiver Medikamente untersucht. In der ersten Studie wurden Antidepressiva, in der zweiten Studie Antihypertonika verabreicht. Zu unterschiedlichen Zeitpunkten in bezug auf die Einnahme wurden Sprechproben erhoben. Ausghend von der bereits bekannten muskelentspannenden Wirkung der untersuchten Präparate wurde ein Absinken der mittleren Grundfrequenz (F0) und ein Anstieg des Anteils spektraler Energie unterhalb von 500 Hz (LFR) hypostasiert. Der LFR zeigt den erwarteten Effekt in beiden Experimenten. Das Absinken der F0 war nur im ersten Experiment zu beobachten, im zweiten Experiment trat stattdessen eine leichte Tendenz zu einem Anstieg auf. Die Brauchbarkeit der beiden Maße als stimmliche Indikatoren emotionaler Zustände wird diskutiert. Deux expériences ont été realisées en vue d'étudier avec des sujets normaux les effets de substances psychoactives. Dans la première étude, la substance administrée était antidépressive, dans la seconde, antihypertonique. Des échantillons de parole ont été recuellis à différentes étapes du traitement. A partir de l'effet connu de ces subtances sur le relâchement musculaire, on peut prédire une diminution globale de la fréquence fondamentale (F0), et, à l'inverse, une augmentation de la proportion d'énergie spectrale au-dessus de 500 Hz (LFR). Le LFR montre l'effet attendu dans les deux expériences. La F0, par contre, décroît dans la première expérience mais tend à augmenter légèrement dans la deuxième expérience.

"It is argued in this paper that proper names are linguistic signs, and, just like other denoting lexical units, they are also carriers of some formal linguistic restrictions regarding, e.g., gender and number.

Thus their inclusion in an unabridged dictionary is a must and should not be considered as a bonus.",0,1
"Due to historical conditions, and in contrast to other Romance areas, a common standard language appears quite late in Italy. In the 16th century Tuscan definitively establishes itself as a literary language, but it is only after the political unification of the country in the second half of the 19th century that the foundations are laid for its linguistic unification. This has led to a multiform linguistic history and the persistence of an uncommonly high level of diatopic variation in the Italo-Romance area. Dialect dictionaries bear witness to these historical events and to the vitality which dialects still have in modern Italy, despite the increasing pressure of the standard language. The present article aims to describe briefly the various typologies of dialect dictionaries, focusing on the way they select and organize the linguistic material, the targets they set themselves, and the results they achieve.",0,1
"1. Analysis of the grammatically complete sentence in Ukrainian reveals, as elsewhere in Indo-European, the familiar 'logical' polarity of subject and predicate. The nucleus of the subject is preponderantly a nominal element, that of the predicate a verbal one; apart from their characteristic suffixes of derivation, the first is defined morphologically by a system of declension, the second by a system of conjugation, i.e. by two contrasting patterns of flexion. The fact of flexion itself serves as a criterion to discriminate between the inflected and the uninflected lexical constituents (lexemes) of the language. The nominal system is, if anything, rather more involved than the verbal and covers the expression of a series of notional categories, only some of which (e.g. person and number) it shares with the verb. Selected case-relations are represented by more or less characteristic morphemes, and the variety of these is multiplied by the demands of gender and number. The clarity of the Ukrainian system of declension is somewhat obscured by the intrusion of the category of gender into a slowly disintegrating complex of variant paradigms. The predominance of gender inflexion is so obvious that synchronic grammar prefers a generic classification of declensional types to the earlier diachronic classification by stems defined partly in hypothetical terms (o-declension, d-declension, etc.). Nominal flexion implies the expression of several sets of correlations of varying scope: NUMBER, pointing a contrast between singular and plural; GENDER, here a complex of four antitheses (animate/inanimate, personal/impersonal, feminine/non-feminine, masculine/neuter) expressed in three overlapping generic groups; SYNTACTIC POSITION, opposing attributive to predicative function; and CASE, which presents the dichotomy of nominative (casus rectus) and oblique (casus obliquus), the former regarded as fundamental and amorphemic (merkmallos'), the latter embodied in a paradigm of semantically associated endings. The category of number shows vestiges of a dual, which has complicated the syntax of the genitive singular without affecting the correlation of singular and plural. This antithesis, however, is not uniform, as it does not possess the same connotation in the substantive and its immediate congeners on the one hand and the personal pronoun on the other (see below), and even in the substantive the plural may be conceived as either collective or multiplex. Gender, notionally, is more than the customary grammatical trinity of masculine, feminine, and neuter; it represents the intersection of the categories of animateness, person, and sex with their characteristic polarities. As for the case paradigms, they offer only a few instances of the correlatives nominative and oblique (e.g. sto",0,1
"Speech signal contains the emotional state of a speaker along with the message. The recognition of the emotional state of a speaker helps in determining the true meaning of a message and allows for more natural communication between humans and machines. This paper presents the design and development of a dyadic emotional speech corpus for the Urdu language. The corpus is developed by recording dialog scenarios for anger, happy, neutral, and sad emotions. The performance of frame-level features, utterance-level features, and spectrograms have been evaluated in this work. Emotion recognition experiments have been conducted using classifiers including Support Vector Machine, Hidden Markov Models and Convolutional Neural Networks. Experimental results show that the utterance-level features outperform the frame-level features and spectrograms. The combined feature set of cepstral, spectral, prosodic, and voice quality features performs better than the individual feature sets. The unweighted average recalls of 84.1%, 80.2%, 84.7% have been achieved for speaker-dependent and speaker-independent and text-independent emotion recognition, respectively.",0,1

"Contemporary Chinese has only one form of first-person pronoun; by contrast, there are at least four different first-person pronominal forms used in Classical Chinese. This makes Classical Chinese first-person pronouns noteworthy to investigate. This co-existence of forms with similar meaning of self-referencing raises two issues, namely the reason behind this co-existence and the relationships among these pronominal forms in terms of sociopragmatic use. Unlike what has been previously argued in the field that address forms rather than pronouns are politeness-related (e.g., Kádár 2007; Pan & Kádár 2011), first-person pronominal forms in Classical Chinese express a diverse set of contextually-situated politeness-related meanings. Furthermore, these pronominal forms are socially indexical, in the sense that they are allocated to speakers depending on their social status. Thus, a central argument of this paper is that the pronominal forms studied reveal information about both the person who uses them and the context in which they are used. The paper compares pronominal forms used in the Lunyu 論語 or The analects of Confucius (475 BC–221 BC) and Shishuo Xinyu 世說新語 (A new account of the tales of the world) (200 AD–400 AD), to understand the pragmatic implications and politeness values of these different first-person pronominal forms over a time-span of 400–600 years and also to provide a glimpse of how eventually only one form came to exist in contemporary Chinese.",0,1
"During the Sixties there were a series of social, cultural, political and economic factors that led to the emergence of an underground theatre movement localized in New York's Greenwich Village and Lower East Side. This counter-cultural theatre was born under very specific historical conditions, (coinciding with the rise of the Civil Right's movement, the emergence of youth culture, etc.), and it only lasted for several years. Yet, its vitality would turn out to be essential in the development of contemporary American Drama in promoting the work of young playwrights such as Shepard, Wilson or Fornes, whose experimentations opened the way for future generations of dramatists. One of the key elements in order to understand the emergence and promotion of the playwright's work is the notion of community, that is, the acknowledgement of the importance of belonging to an urban community; this paper will thus explore in which ways did the urban context shape an often transgressive aesthetic experience characterized by an unconditional freedom of expression.",0,1
"This study illustrates why preschool children who are dual language learners (DLLs) are not a homogeneous group. An empirically developed model of preschool DLL subgroups, based on latent class analysis, was presented. The model reflects three separate subgroups of DLL children present in many classrooms where DLL children are served: Bilinguals, Emergent Bilinguals, and Heritage Language Speakers. Differences in standard scores based on teacher ratings of the developmental progress of preschool children were detected between the DLL subgroups and, relative to non-DLLs, at the beginning and throughout the preschool year. Differences were also found among classrooms having varying concentrations of DLLs. These findings highlight the importance of classroom composition to the development and learning of all children and suggest that policy makers and administrators should strive for classrooms that represent balanced diversity considering DLL status, race, ethnicity, economic status, and children with special needs.",0,1

"Cognition is thinking; it feels like something to think, and only those who can feel can think. There are also things that thinkers can do. We know neither how thinkers can think nor how they are able to do what they can do. We are waiting for cognitive science to discover how. Cognitive science does this by testing hypotheses about what processes can generate what doing (“know-how”).This is called the Turing Test. It cannot test whether a process can generate feeling, hence thinking — only whether it can generate doing. The processes that generate thinking and know-how are “distributed” within the heads of thinkers, but not across thinkers’ heads. Hence there is no such thing as distributed cognition, only collaborative cognition. Email and the Web have spawned a new form of collaborative cognition that draws upon individual brains’ real-time interactive potential in ways that were not possible in oral, written or print interactions.",0,1

"Geopolitical borderlands such as the moving frontier of the Christian reconquest in medieval Iberia and today's mexican-U.S. border call to mind complex cultural and linguistic dimensions that internal nonbordering areas do not. Peoples living in border or liminal cultural areas are often characterized as having hard-to-define and multiple identities, a situation often reflected in their linguistic performances. Although political borders may be well defined, linguistic borders are not. On either side of political borders we find an overlapping and intermixing of languages within a small geographical space, and the contact between two or more languages along border areas has produced widely different linguistic outcomes, such as continued development of each individual language, language mixing or shift, or language extinction of at least one of the languages. The linguistic circumstances of Spanish and english along the mexican-U.S. border today in many ways parallel those of the border areas of medieval Iberia and the Arabic and Romance languages. Given the many similarities between Al-Andalus (711–1492 c.e.) and the Southwest, a comparative analysis of the sociolinguistic developments within Al-Andalus and those of the American Southwest may further our understanding of underlying linguistic processes that may contribute to or hinder the successful maintenance of languages in border areas.",0,1

"Webster's Third and the Pronunciation of Hawaiian Loanwords in English: A Different View of Usage T AlbertJ. Schütz University of'Hawai'i at Mänoa he last line in a well-known hapa-haolè song contains what is undoubtedly the longest Hawaiian borrowing in English:2 Where the humuhumunukunukuäpua'a go swimming by.3 Ifyou were a singer, unfamiliar with Hawaiian and learning this song from the sheet music, how could you find out how to pronounce the word? The standard advice is: look it up in a dictionary. And the word does indeed appear in the 2003 electronic version of Merriam-Webster III (MW), with the following pronunciation transcription (followed by the original, divided into measures (stress units), which are explained later): \ihüm3lhüm3inük3lnük31äp3lwälä\4 (humu humu nuku nuku ä pua'a)5 1 As a musical genre, hapa haole refers to a song whose lyrics are on Hawaiian themes, but are mainly in English, usually with a few Hawaiian words or phrases included. 2 Mahalo (thanks) to Carolyn Andrews, who inspired this study by requesting that I write an article on pronouncing Hawaiian words borrowed into English for her website, Carolyn's Corner (Schütz 2006). For their help with editing, mahah to Laurie Durand, George W. Grace, and 'Öiwi ParkerJones. 3 Cogswell, Harrison, and Noble 1933. 4 The MWpronunciation symbols that are cited in this paper are: a hl, â Ici, ä IaJ, au/ au/, e /e/, ê /i/, i hl, ï /ai/, ö loi, ü IvJ. Other conventions used are: italics for orthographic forms, square brackets for phonetic transcriptions, // forward slashes for phonemic transcriptions, and W back slashes for MW transcriptions. 5 This line shows the accent units for this especially long word. Dictionaries:Journal ofthe Dictionary Society ofNorth America 30 (2009), 1-17 Albert J. Schütz Here are the problems with the MW pronunciation. (1) The five unstressed uvowels would never be pronounced as [o] . (2) A primary stress would better reflect /ä/. (3) The \w\ is unnecessary. (4) English does not permit a sequence of identical vowels (\ä(ä\) within a word. (5) The alternating stress levels represent neither the usual Hawaiian or English pronunciation . Turning to a different genre, volcanology, we check the dictionary pronunciations of two well-known terms for types of lava: pähoehoe and 'a'??. MWgives: \po'höe|höe\ and Va1 ä, ,ä'ä\ (pä hoe hoe)('a'ä) The first pronunciation is recognizable, but would be more so if the first syllable were transcribed as Apä/ (with a secondary stress) and the final vowels in the next two syllables as \a\ or \e\. As for the rendering of 'a'ä, the second alternate better represents the final long and stressed vowel of the original, but as in #4 above, this sequence runs counter to English phonological and phonetic patterns. In this article, I discuss how MWhas represented the pronunciation of Hawaiian words borrowed into English. It is not entirely a catalog of errors; many words are handled satisfactorily. But the data do not appear to have been approached systematically. To correct those that have not, I recommend ways in which the transcription can more accurately reflect an authentic Hawaiian pronunciation and still stay within the phonological system of Standard English. And, just as important, I explain why in 2009 — as opposed to 1961, when MWwas published — it is advisable to do so. Introduction Most studies of borrowing concentrate on the direction of the major flow, as it were — that is, words borrowed from the introduced language into the local language. Perhaps one of the reasons is that the figures for the lexical exchange in that direction are so much higher. For example, there are anywhere from 1800 to 3,000 loanwords from English to Hawaiian (ParkerJones forthcoming; p.c., 27/5/08) .6 This is a striking 6 This topic has also been the topic of studies by, e.g., Denzil Carr (1951) and AlbertJ.

"This paper presents findings from a pre–post study on pre-service teachers’ beliefs about multilingualism and language use. A full cohort of pre-service middle school teachers in Germany (n = 259) was surveyed before and after completing a compulsory module on multilingualism using a validated instrument that captures participants’ beliefs about (a) multilingual language use in the home, (b) multilingual language use in the classroom, and (c) teacher responsibility for language support in teaching and learning. While mean average scores of the respondents’ beliefs are not as high as in comparable studies, the results show a significant increase between the pre- and post-test. Multivariate statistics are employed to explore different dimensions of beliefs improvement as well as predictors of positive beliefs. With a critical view about the Likert-scale type items, the quantitative dataset was expanded by structured interviews with five participants. The results of qualitative content analyses of these interviews make it possible to show different facets of the survey’s constructs of beliefs as well as individual backgrounds making them explainable, and thus help to gain a more nuanced picture of the respondents’ beliefs.",0,1

The search for a good initial phase estimate leads us to consider synchronized overlap-add methods which are further optimized to eventually arrive at WSOLA, a technique based on a waveform similarity criterion. In diesem Tutorium über Zeitverlaufsskalierung wird ganz besonders der Gedanke an ein aufwandsgünstiges und hochqualitatives Verfahren verfolgt. Wir favorisieren eine Zeitverlaufsskalierung auf der Basis von Zeit–Frequenz-Darstellungen vor modellbasierten Ansätzen und betrachten eine iterative Phasenrekonstruktionsmethode für zeits- kalierte Spektrogramme des Amplitudenbetrags. Die Suche nach einer geeigneten initialen Phase führt uns zu einer Betrachtung von synchronisierten Overlap-Add Verfahren, die bei weiterer Optimierung schließlich zu WSOLA führen, eine Technik, die auf dem Kriterum der Signalfosrmähnlichkeit beruht.□ Dans cet exposé sur la modification de la structure temporelle du signal de parole, nous opterons pour l'utilisation des représentations temps–fréquence du signal, plutôt que pour des représentations par modèles. Nous examinerons une méthode itérative permettant de reconstruire une fonction de phase pour spectrogrammes d'amplitude modifiés. La recherche d'une bonne condition initiale pour démarrer l'itération nous ammènera aux méthodes de recouvrement-addition synchronisées et notamment à WSOLA, une technique basée sur un critère de ressemblance entre formes d'ondes.",0,1
"In 2016, Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen officially apologised to the island’s indigenous peoples. This national apology not only plays a persuasive role in informing the general public about the historical wrongdoings inflicted on the Taiwanese aborigines, but also constitutes a therapeutic and restorative role in the process of reconciliation with the indigenous victims. This article provides a critical discourse analysis of President Tsai’s apology. In particular, it examines the power and ideology embedded in both the speech and the related ceremony, and is supplemented with extracts from interviews with a cross-section of key stakeholders, such as a former Constitutional/Supreme Court Justice, indigenous/tribal leaders and members/staff/advisers from the Presidential Office Indigenous Historical Justice and Transitional Justice Committee. The analysis reveals that, despite President Tsai’s apology and reconciliation policies, instead of facilitating reconciliation, the apology appears to exacerbate the long-standing latent tension between indigenous and non-indigenous groups. While the apology opens a window for reconciliation, a higher level of commitment is required to promote structural and systemic changes, such as land restitution, before the apology can be deemed adequate.",0,1

"Abstract Romance clitic pronouns appear to the left of the verb in I and to the right of the verb in C. This alternation correlates with: (a) allomorphy, specifically l‐ vs. zero; (b) stress shifts; and (c) reordering of the clitic string. The alternations in (a)–(c) are also observed between non‐negative and negative contexts. The key points of our analysis are: (i) the l ‐ segment is associated with definite content; (ii) interpretively, pronouns scope out of modal/non‐veridical operators; (iii) syntactically, the exponent for modality/non‐veridicality may have the pronoun in its domain; (iv) externalization of the l‐ segment is found when semantic scope (ii) and syntactic configuration (iii) are mismatched. Therefore allomorphies (including stress), far from being morphophonological quirks, contribute to the externalization of syntactico‐semantic notions of non‐veridicality. In dealing with clitic (re)ordering we propose a model based on the dissociation between Merge and linear order. Phrasal constituents are ordered to the right of the verb in Romance; clitics mirror them in that they are ordered to the left, while keeping the Merge relations constant.",0,1
"Among the main lip-geometry measures such as: - frontal: width, height, area; - lateral: upper, lower and corner protrusions; lip horn opening and depth; some relations are of interest for acoustic, articulatory and practical modeling. In order to maximize the proper movements of the lips themselves, a corpus was designed to explore the maximum lip manoeuvre space for French vowels (5 speakers) using naturally close jaw conditions (consonantal [s] and [∫] contexts). Since Fromkin's (1964) “[i,a,u] angle”, it has been well known, that for front views, both width and height are needed for calculation of lip area: Area/(Width × Height) = constant (somehow speaker dependent: around 0.75). Proposals to calculate are from width or height alone are thus discarded. Profile protrusions are naturally strongly correlated, and so is lip horn depth with corner protrusion. So we can choose corner as the pivot in lip horn profile modeling. But, for such a modeling, the most interesting relation between front and profile views is the inverse correlation between width and protrusion (on condition that corner protrusion is chosen). Hence prediction of area is possible through profile measurements namely with height (or opening) and corner protrusion: Area/[Height × (Ref - corner protrusion)] = constant (where Ref. is the chosen reference for protrusion measures). Die Modellierung des Ansatzrohrabschlusses im äußeren Lippenbereich zu akustischen, artikulatorischen und auch rein praktischen Zwecken erfordert Einsicht in die Beziehungen zwischen den beiden Dimensionen der Lippengeometrie: - Aufsicht: horizontale Breite, vertikaler Abstand, Querschnittsfläche; - Profil: obere und untere Protrusion sowie Vorstülpung des Lippenwinkels; öffnung und Tiefe des äusseren Lippenbereichs. Das benutzte Untersuchungsmaterial gestattet die Auswertung des maximalen Bewegungsraumes der Lippen bei der Produktion französischer Vokale (5 Sprecher) in Verbindung mit Konsonanten, die durch einen engen Kieferwinkel (Kontexte [s] und [∫] die Eigenbewegungen der Lippen deutlich hervortreten lassen. Seit Fromkins “[i,a,u]-Winkel” ist bekannt, dass in der Aufsicht Breite und Abstand zur Bestimmung der Querschnittsfläche herangezogen werden müssen: Querschnittsfläche/(Breite × Abstand) = konstant (sprecherabhängig: etwa 0.75). Methoden zur Querschnittsernittlung mit nur einer dieser Größen werden daher nicht berücksichtigt. Die Protrusionen aus der Profilsicht sind natürlicherweise eng miteinander korreliert; dasselbe gilt für die Tiefe des äusseren Lippenbereichs und die Protrusion des Lippenwinkels. Wir haben daher den Lippenwinkel als Angelpunkt der Profilmodellierung gewählt. Für eine Modellierung des gesamten ässeren Lippenbereichs ist zweifellos die inverse Korrelation von besonderer Bedeutung, die wir zwischen der horizontalen Breite der Lippen und der Protrusion des Lippenwinkels beobachtet haben. Die Querschnittsfläche lässt sich also auch auf der Grundlage der Profildaten Abstand (korreliert mit der Lippenöffnung) und Protrusion des Lippenwinkels berechnen: Querschnitt/[Abstand × (Ref. - Protrusion des Lippenwinkels)] = konstant (wo Ref. die gewählte Bezugsgrösse für die Protrusionsmessungen bedeuter). La modélisation de la sortie du conduit vocal nécessite que soient connues les relations qu'entretiennent les dimensions de la géométrie des lèvres: - de face: l'écartement, la séparation, l'aire; - de profil: les protrusions supérieure, inférieure, du coin; l'aperture du pavillon et sa profondeur. Ceci pour des raisons acoustiques, articulatoires et tout simplement pratiques (liées à l'exploitation des données). Le corpus utilisé explore l'espace maximum de manoeuvre sur les lévres du française (5 locuteurs), avec des consonnes qui requièrent naturellement un contrôle précis de la mandibule (contextes [s] et [∫], et qui, par leur influence fermante, maximisent les mouvements propres aux lèvres. Pour les mesures de face, il est bien connu, depuis Fromkin (1964), que “l'angle [i,a,u]” des lèvres impose de calculer l'aire à partir de l'ecartement et de la séparation: Aire/(Ecartement × Séparation) = constante (dépendante quelque peu du locateur: autour de 0.75). Ainsi les propositions tendant à calculer l'aire avec une seule de ces mesures ne peuvent être retenues. De profil, les protrusions sont naturellement très corrélées; et il en va de même pour la profondeur du pavillon avec la protrusion du coin de la fente labiale. Nous pouvons donc choisir ce coin comme un pivot de la modélisation de profil. Mais le plus crucial pour la modélisation de tout le pavillon est sans doute la corrélation inverse que nous avons pu observer entre l'écartement et la protrusion (à condition de bien choisir la protrusion du coin). On peut donc calculer l'aire à partir de mesures de profil, avec la séparation (corrélée à l'ouverture du pavillon) et la protrusion du coin: Aire/[Séparation × (Ref. - protrusion du coin)] = constante (où ref. est la référence choisie pour les mesures de protrusion).",0,1
"To cope with the COVID-19 pandemic, various policy measures accompanied by health crisis communication were adopted in China to engage publics. In this study, we investigated how People’s Daily communicated COVID-19 messages on Weibo. Drawing on the Appraisal Framework, we developed a three-stage mixed method approach to study 400 COVID-19 posts to identify the attitude resources employed and their association with public engagement. We found that attitudinal posts were more engaging than non-attitudinal posts. Judgment, both positive and negative, was positively associated with public engagement, whereas the use of positive Affect and Appreciation could be ineffective. These findings contribute to the understanding of how public engagement on social media can be enhanced through the use of attitudinal messages in health emergencies.",0,1
"Building on investment theory, this study analyses the language attitudes of secondary school students in Songea, Tanzania, with a focus on identity and access to digital technology. The study involved 467 secondary school students aged 14–21 years. The data were collected through questionnaires and interviews. Less than half of the students had access to digital technology. Most of them lacked the required linguistic resources. English, a challenge to most students, and, to some extent, even Swahili, are seen as tools for future possibilities and success. Students invest in learning English and want to go abroad. Lack of resources notwithstanding, students’ decisions to invest in learning a particular language is mostly influenced by imagined possibilities. Structural inequalities and socioeconomic differences impact both language skills and the use of digital tools. Consequently, digital resources using mainly English and difficult Swahili terminology become an exclusion mechanism for many Tanzanian secondary school students.",0,1

"This paper demonstrates the existence of the Greater West Bomberai family, bringing the Timor-Alor-Pantar language family of the Lesser Sunda islands into a genealogical unit with the Papuan languages of the western part of the Bomberai peninsula in New Guinea. Applying the comparative method to the increasingly available data from these languages, we demonstrate their relatedness on the basis of 47 lexical cognate sets with largely regular sound correspondences. Grammatical evidence in the form of pronouns is further invoked to demonstrate the relatedness of these languages. Loans from Austronesian languages have been identified and eliminated from our comparisons. Establishing the family has repercussions for our view of Island Southeast Asian prehistory, entailing the existence of maritime Papuan-language speaking groups from an early time.",0,1

"The theory of ritual presented in this article is based on the notion of “territory.” Ritual performance encompasses a set of techniques to affect the identity of participants: away from individuality and by communal demarcation of a symbolic territorial model in space or time. The form of ritual is seen as autonomous, i.e. as relatively independent of meaning. As a set of identity-affecting techniques, the elements of ritual can be integrated into both religious and secular settings. There is a natural tension between individuality, responsibility and the potentially totalitarian implications of ritual discourse. Ritual is claimed to be relatively harmless with respect to the symbolic territories of designated “sacred spaces”, while it is considered dangerous under conditions of “overflow”, when the elements of ritual are brought into public space. The harmful secular religions of the past two centuries are discussed, culminating in a plea for the separation between Ritual and State.",0,1
"This paper presents a study on text complexity of Open Educational Resources (OER) in Brazilian Portuguese. In a data analysis of the Brazilian Ministry of Education Integrated Platform (MEC-RED) carried out in September 2020, 86% of the resources on the platform did not have any grade level classification, making it difficult to find, use, and expand them. The text complexity task in the Natural Language Processing research area can be used to identify texts that have adequate linguistic complexity for specific grade levels, allowing to complete the stage of education metadata in MEC-RED. However, some types of MEC-RED’s resources do not present any information about their stage of education, making it unfeasible to compile a balanced dataset of OER for training a text complexity predictor. This study is driven and enabled by a recently created corpus of transcribed spoken narratives produced by fourth graders to first graders of high school which were collected to evaluate the development of language abilities. A multi-task learning (MTL) approach via hard parameter sharing of hidden layers was adopted to train three models that share all parameters in their hidden layers. The main objective of this study was to explore the relationship between three text complexity tasks by jointly learning to predict text readability, using coarse and fine-grained datasets of written, spoken and domain texts (a small dataset of OER resources) to overcome the lack of grade classified resources in MEC-RED. Our MTL model with two auxiliary tasks presents a F-measure of 0.955, an improvement of 0.15 points over our previous results.",0,1
"Dictionary Definitions of Linguistic Terms P. K. Saha JLIictionary definitions of some linguistic terms exemplify an old South Asian proverb which notes that the darkest spot is right beneath the lamp. Since language is the main concern of dictionaries, one might expect dictionaries to pay special attention to linguistic terminology. In keeping with the logic of the proverb, however, it is this particular area that needs some extra illumination. The average college dictionary contains about a thousand words that involve language in one way or another, and in this paper I will examine about a dozen or so linguistic terms in three widely used dictionaries and show that there are serious inadequacies in the definitions of these words. The three dictionaries are Merriam-Webster's Collegiate * Dictionary, Tenth Edition 1993 (WlO), Webster's New World Dictionary, 3d College Edition 1988 [1991] (WNWD), and Random House Webster's College Dictionary 1991 [1992] (RHWCD). The problems are of three types: first, some of the definitions are inaccurate; second, there is inadequate coordination between definitions of some related words; third, there is the problem of incomplete or missing linguistic definitions. A striking example of the first problem is the definition of reflexive pronoun in WlO: a pronoun referring to the subject of die sentence, clause, or verbal phrase in which it stands; specif: a personal pronoun compounded with -self. WNWD and RHWCD also make the same basic claim. All three dictionaries say that the antecedent of a reflexive must be a subject. In many sentences, however, the antecedent of a reflexive can be an object . For example, in sentences like: 150P. K. Saha (1)You can divide a number by itself. (2)The chef folded die dough over itself. (3)The government cannot protect individuals from diemselves . the reflexives clearly have direct objects as dieir antecedents. WNWD and RHWCD bodi make the problem worse by claiming diat a reflexive is necessarily an object. Here is the definition of reflexive from die RHWCD: ""(of a pronoun) used as an object with the same referent as die subject of a verb . . ."" According to diis definition, a reflexive must be an object of some kind, but in sentences such as: (4)John is not himself today. the reflexive himself is not an object but rather a predicate nominative . Since better definitions or descriptions of reflexive appeared long ago (see Lees and Klima 1963, FaIu 1977, and Saha 1987), die shortcomings in these dictionary definitions should have been remedied by now. Closely related to reflexives and to pronouns in general, die words anaphor and anaphora have also been topics of scholarly discussion for many years (see Reinhart 1983 and works cited there). Yet anaphor is listed only in one of these diree dictionaries (WlO). All three define die rhetorical meaning of anaphora properly, but the linguistic meaning is eidier not mentioned at all (WNWD) or incorrectly defined (WlO and RHWCD). The RHWCD defines anaphora as: the use of a word as a regular grammatical substitute for a preceding word or group of words, as the use of it and do in I know it and they do, too. WlO defines anaphora as: use of a grammatical substitute (as a pronoun or a pro-verb) to refer to die denotation of a preceding word or group of words. . . . It is significant that the word preceding is used in both definitions. Neidier definition can accommodate routine cases in which antecedents do not precede die words to which diey refer. In sentences such as: (5)A picture of himself would be acceptable to Bill as a gift. (6)The promises to each odier diat Mary and Joe made were never broken. _______________Dictionary Definitions of Linguistic Terms____________151 the anaphoric words himself and each other have antecedents that do not precede die words to which they refer. In (5), the antecedent of 'himself is 'Bill', while in (6) the antecedent of 'each other' is 'Mary and Joe'. The definitions of anaphora in these dictionaries ought to be revised. At the very least, the phrase ""a preceding word"" in these definitions should be replaced by ""a word or group of words usually appearing elsewhere in the discourse."" Most of the anaphoric words cited...",0,1
This essay honors the work of Joel Sherzer by using his discourse‐centered approach to language and culture as a way to investigate the place of speech play and verbal art in concerns with interpretative frameworks.

Sherzer's concern with ambiguity is highlighted as a way to contrast a discourse‐centered approach with Perspectivism.,0,1
"Abstract For gesture research outside anthropology, the promise – and challenge – of anthropological method stems from one or more of its core commitments: its pursuit of human variation, both diachronic and synchronic; its insistence on naturalistic rather than experimental research design; and its integrative sensibility that situates human behavior in relation to an expansive sociocultural context. This essay reflects on this last sensibility. As we envision an anthropology of gesture and weigh its potential for gesture studies, we should pause and reflect on the fitful history of gesture in anthropology. As a parable for the present, I revisit a neglected anthropological voice from twentieth-century gesture research: Ray L. Birdwhistell, whose ambitious postwar science of kinesics teamed film-based microanalysis with American linguistic structuralism. At stake in Birdwhistell’s work was a problem that looms large here, that of how and at what cost a science of gesture can contextualize its object integratively.",0,1

This article presents a detailed demonstration of a method for establishing an inventory of productive affixes in a language for which a large corpus is not available. This method evaluates the productivity of an affix first and foremost on the basis of its threshold of profitability (the number of different words derived via the affix) in correlation with other diagnostics to bolster reliability. These other diagnostics are the semantic and phonological transparency of derived words and the decomposability of such words. The application of themethod is illustrated step-by-step with data from St. Lucian.",0,1

"Principles for the Inclusion of New Words in College Dictionaries Jesse T Sheidlower L\i ew words are consistently among the most publicized elements of a college dictionary. There are of course a great many other elements that can be changed between editions, but the currency of a dictionary will be measured largely by its inclusion of neologisms. And whatever other changes an updated version of a dictionary may reflect—in focused definitions, in style of presentation, in improved writing, in better example sentences, in more accurate etymologies—it is primarily the coverage of current vocabulary that attracts the attention of the public. New-word editors now have an embarrassment of resources at their disposal. There are a number of dictionaries of new words that have appeared in recent years (see the list in Algeo 1993, to which can now be added Simpson and Weiner 1993a and b, and Lerner and Belkin 1993). There are two periodical collections of neologisms, the ""Among the New Words"" (ANW) column in American Speech and the Barnhart Dictionary Companion (BDC). There are other regular but generally less thorough discussions of new words, such as Anne Soukhanov's ""Word Watch"" column in The Atlantic Monthly, Thomas M. Paikeday 's ""Lexicon"" in English Today, William Safire's ""On Language"" in The New York Times Magazine, and the ""Dictionary Update"" column in Copy Editor, which I edit. And perhaps most important, diere are electronic databases such as NEXIS, LEXIS, and DIALOG that can provide useful data about the frequency, distribution, time frame, and range of use of words and phrases. Yet despite this plethora of research options, the decision to include any new word must be based on the answers to a number of questions, with a range of relevance: How much evidence, and of what sort, is there for the term? How useful will inclusion be to the users of Principles for the Inclusion of New Words33 the dictionary? On a different level, how much mileage can the marketing department get out of these words? How many of the competing dictionaries already have a particular neologism? There are four factors that must be regarded as paramount in any policy governing inclusion of a new word: the number of citations, the range of use of the citations, the time span in which the citations are found, and what might be called the word's cruciality, or the need to have the word in the language in the first place. The number of citations is the most obvious factor. This encompasses ""the number of citations from different sources,"" which is something of a continuum. Two citations from the same article in the same magazine is not as good as two cites from different authors writing in different issues of the same magazine, which is in turn not as good as two citations, one from a magazine and one from a book by a different author on an unrelated topic. Without making too much of a simple issue, however, the more sources the better: more sources mean a clearer picture of the frequency and range of a term. This point has been well covered and does not need discussion here; see for example the excellent discussion in Landau 1984, 161f. Range of use is very important, because even words that are and have been rather common in certain fields might not be candidates for a college dictionary. Technical terms of various sorts probably make up the biggest batch of such words: though they might be common and important in their fields, if they do not have much mainstream use they can probably be safely excluded from a college dictionary . A college dictionary, we must remember, is aimed at people without proficiency in a given field: a mathematician who needs to know the exact meaning of a technical term will not look it up in a standard dictionary. While this does not excuse poor defining of those terms that are included, it does excuse the omission of those specialized terms (e.g., Bose-Einstein condensate or glucosyltransferase) that the mainstream reader would not be expected to encounter. The range of a word can change rapidly; a term that has been...",0,1

"Abstract Demonstratives form a vital part of the English system of noun reference, but compared to other forms of reference such as articles and pronouns, their acquisition by second language learners has been researched relatively little. Using the Givenness Hierarchy (Gundel et al. 1993. Language 69. 274–307) as a theoretical backdrop for discussing the research on native English speakers’ use of demonstratives, this review explains the unique position that demonstratives hold as part of the reference system of English. The review then covers the relatively small body of research concerning English language learners’ (ELLs) acquisition and use of demonstratives, mainly in written expository essays and oral narratives. It also illustrates how ELLs would benefit from being taught the discourse uses of demonstratives early in their language education, a topic that is not currently addressed sufficiently in many English‐as‐a‐second‐language textbooks.",0,1

"In this article, I will show that, despite its wide use, the term ‘stress’ is too ambiguous and therefore must be replaced by a set of other terms that together cover the various usages of ‘stress’. Firstly, we need to be able to distinguish between the formal representation of ‘stress’ and the correlates of ‘stress’. Within the formal representation of ‘stress’ I will show that we have to separate four notions: accent, edge prominence (EP), rhythm and weight. Accordingly, we also need to reckon with potentially different correlates. Here, I will use stress as a general label for phonetic correlates and distinguish stressA, stressEP, stressR and stressW. The article will then mainly focus on accent and its correlates. I will first propose central parts of a theory of accent. Then, I will address the question as to whether we need to single out pitch (or tone) as a special correlate of accent, i.e. one that is not included in the correlate stressA, which would entail a currently controversial distinction between what is traditionally called stress-accent and pitch-accent. The article concludes with a discussion of refinements, problems and extensions of the accentual system proposed here (including the deconstructing of ‘tone’).",0,1
"This paper focuses on the linguistic composition of commercial signs in the linguistic landscape (LL) of Athens, Greece. Previous studies have mainly been carried out in officially multilingual and multi-ethnic areas [Ben-Rafael, E., Shohamy, E., Amara, M. H., & Trumper-Hecht, N. (2006). Linguistic landscape as symbolic construction of the public space: The case of Israel. In D. Gorter (Ed.), Linguistic landscape: A new approach to multilingualism (pp. 7–28). Clevedon: Multilingual Matters; Cenoz, J., & Gorter, D. (2006). Linguistic landscape and minority languages. In D. Gorter (Ed.), Linguistic landscape: A new approach to multilingualism (pp. 67–80). Clevedon: Multilingual Matters; Huebner, T. (2006). Bangkok's linguistic landscapes: Environmental print, codemixing and language change. In D. Gorter (Ed.), Linguistic landscape: A new approach to multilingualism (pp. 31–51). Clevedon: Multilingual Matters]. Greece, however, is characterised by official monolingualism and a great degree of ethnic homogenisation, which suggests that apart from tourist areas, one would expect that languages and scripts other than Greek would not be as visible as in contexts characterised by official or de facto multilingualism. A total of 621 shop signs were collected and analysed both quantitatively and qualitatively. The findings indicate that a significant number of shops employ – often creatively – languages other than Greek, either monolingually or in combination with Greek, resulting in a situation of written multilingualism, with English emerging as the strongest linguistic player. The results also strongly suggest that the multilingual character of commercial signs is not primarily informational but symbolic reflecting a desire to project a cosmopolitan, sophisticated, and trendy outlook.",0,1
"Defining can be as simple and natural as the common practice between mother and child, or an erudite exercise pursued by scientists and an area of scrutiny for lexicographers. This paper examines the question of how members of a literate society progress from a natural beginning towards a mastery of increasingly formalized definition-making. We suggest that formal definition-making is one aspect of becoming literate, where literacy is defined as using and creating written texts. Focusing on the use of the expression of the relationship between parts and wholes, we present data from three sources, including children, university students, and an English-language dictionary. Our findings suggest that one important aspect of acquiring literacy is learning to make formal definitions.",0,1
"Relational professionalism in education is a way of regarding teaching as a profession which privileges relationality, or engaged and connected relationships with the self, with others and one’s teaching practice. In this article, I examine a bilingual teacher association who use their annual conference as a vehicle to support and strengthen their membership by adopting relationality as a core value of the association. I analyze how bilingual teachers in this association described the impact of relational professionalism on the association, the conference and on their teaching. Through their interviews, I found that these bilingual teachers described how relational professionalism allowed them to reflect on their bilingual teacher occupational identities, promoted a greater sense of confidence in their own pedagogic practice and agency. It also offered diverse opportunities for working together on self-defined goals, or relational agency.",0,1
"Jimmy Gene Harris died in Seattle on 30 September 2012, at the age of 82. He led a remarkable life. He was a soldier of fortune, a champion for human rights, an exacting phonetic fieldworker, an observer of human nature, a teller of stories, a teacher and a mentor. Raised in the Arkansas Ozarks, he began his international adventures as a US Marine Corps sergeant in the Korean War. He pursued his linguistic education in Mexico City and at the University of Washington, with an MA in 1966 specializing in Japanese and Asian Studies, while also carrying out fundamental language revitalization fieldwork with the Stó:lō Nation (Salish) in the Fraser River Valley of BC. In 1973, he obtained an MEd from the University of Southern California. On leave from his duties in the field from 1976 to 1978, he spent time refining his phonetic knowledge with David Abercrombie in Edinburgh and with Eugénie Henderson in London.",0,1
"Although an increasing body of reading research explores motivation among students from underrepresented racially minoritized groups in academic settings, the research tends to either lump students into an “underrepresented racial minority” (URM) or an “Other” category or focus on students from specific racial backgrounds (e.g., White, Asian, or Black students). This approach results in students too few in number being overlooked (e.g., American Indian students). However, these students represent an important part of the U.S. culture and school population. The scarce research available focuses on achievement gaps, rather than studying factors such as reading motivation and reading self-concept, which have been suggested to contribute to reading success among American Indian students. Therefore, this study explored self-determined reading motivation, reading self-concept, home reading environment, and student reading behaviors in the prediction of reading achievement among American Indian students representing 19 American Indian Tribes (in comparison to Hispanic students) from one Southwestern State and explored the interrelations between these variables. In a sample of 343 grade 5–8 students (n = 219, 63.8%, American Indian students; n = 124, 36.2% Hispanic students) multiple-group path analyses in Mplus revealed differential relations among the variables: Whereas reading self-concept was the strongest predictor of reading achievement for both groups of students, intrinsic motivation was negatively related to reading achievement for American Indian students. Potential explanations of the observed interrelations are discussed.",0,1
"1. At the present time in generative phonology, substantial emphasis is put on symmetry and regularity at the underlying level. This emphasis has given rise to a number of working hypotheses which, though never stated explicitly, are easily inferable from an examination of the available literature in which sizable bodies of data are analysed. This paper is concerned with two such hypotheses: (1) Alternations which are parallel in distribution are parallel with respect to the PHONOLOGICAL relationship obtaining between their members at the underlying level, even if they do not exhibit PHONETIC parallelism in this respect at the surface level.1 (2) A given alternation in a language is always generated from a single underlying segment.2 The above hypotheses make claims concerning the proper form of a linguistic description and the competence it purports to reflect.3 My purpose in the following pages is to examine their validity with respect to the alternations which are the",0,1
"1. In LANGUAGE 10. 43ff. (1934), R. G. Kent, in his review of L. Bloomfield's Language (New York, 1933), mentions Bloomfield's transcription of the Russian word for city, gorod. Bloomfield writes ['gorot], while Kent would prefer ['gorat]. The justification given to Kent by Bloomfield for his transcription is: 'Weakening of unstressed syllables in Russian is sufficiently indicated when the place of accent is given, i.e., ['gorot] but plural [goro'da] tells as much as ['gorat, gara'da]: in fact, to the persons who know the rule which you cite, it tells more, since each of these transcriptions indicates both the accented and the unstressed forms of each vowel-phoneme, whereas ['gorat], for instance, fails to tell whether the second syllable has [o] or [a] or [i].' The words after 'whereas' have brought to my attention the question of a satisfactory representation of the unstressed Russian vowels from the point of view of a true phonemic transcription. In this paper I propose to discuss the matter, and certain points of consonant structure. 2. It will be necessary to present Russian words in orthographical form (in transliteration), and in phonetic and phonemic transcriptions. The words cited are in roman type, the transliteration without other distinguishing marks, the transcriptions in brackets; translations are in italics. For the transliteration these points are to be noted: 3 and f have their usual phonetic value; c is used for the letter equivalent to English ch in chat; fc is a single letter; ts is a single letter; t + s is represented by t.s; i is the so-called 'short-i' used as the second element of diphthongs; x is the velar voiceless spirant; j represents the so-called 'soft-sign' (palatalizer), and also occurs in ja, ju; y is a historical transcription for the letter 'jery', the sound being now a part of the i-phoneme; e is non-iotacized e. For the phonetic transcription we use a small subjoined j after consonant symbols to indicate the palatalized sounds ([ps, b,, tj, d,] etc.); [c] for the affricate (usually written [tf]); [i, u] are tense vowels; [I, u) are lax; [i] is the unrounded mid-vowel (orthographi334",0,1

"Abstract Dislocation is a kind of construction in which a phrasal constituent (the dislocate) appears at the outer left or right edge of a gap‐less clause (its host) that contains a pronominal correlate of the dislocate. Dislocations are widely attested and presumably universally available across languages. The construction raises a number of problems for core assumptions of syntactic theory, in that these assumptions appear to thwart any coherent resolution of the question of how the dislocate relates to the internal structure of its host. This contribution is divided into two parts. In Part 1, we review central empirical properties of dislocation, which, taken together, appear to defy the laws of syntax as commonly assumed. In Part 2, we review key proposals that have emerged over the last decennia to resolve this paradox and restore dislocations to normalcy.",0,1
"In this opening commentary, we draw on Ruiz’s (NABE J 8:15–34, 1984) metaphorical representations of language to outline the ideological and implementational spaces for language policy making in Greater China. In particular, we highlight how the ‘resource’ orientation allows different stakeholders to negotiate the development of language policies that may help preserve linguistic diversity within a tradition of seeing linguistic unity as foundational to national unity. To illustrate this, we present an analysis of media texts on a major language policy initiative in mainland China and examine relevant discussions in other Chinese contexts. We contend that this ‘resource’ orientation has a significant role in defining the implementational space for language policy making in Greater China, despite the critique that may be levelled at it.",0,1
"Herman Charles Bosman (1905–1951) wrote over 150 English short stories that have established him as an enduring South African writer. The majority of these stories were only recently translated into Afrikaans: between 2011 and 2016 by the publisher, Francois Griebenow, and in 2013 by the poet, Johann de Lange. It would seem that ethical issues have been neglected as the translators have conformed to a simplistic fidelity-driven perception of ethics, while more attention should have been paid to “sensitive” aspects of the original. The research problem is how this gap that exists in translation practice may be addressed. To date, the field of translation ethics has not been exhaustively researched in South Africa. While translators are not responsible for the content of the source text, they are certainly responsible for their translations. This article advocates that responsibility be assumed for ethical choices, especially when translating racially prejudiced texts from the past.",0,1
"En este artículo indagamos parte de las disputas y los conflictos en torno a la definición de una literatura nacional, legitimada por su circulación en el sistema escolar, en la Argentina de fines del siglo XIX y comienzos del siglo XX. Nos centramos para ello en una serie de intervenciones críticas de dos intelectuales-pedagogos especialmente influyentes en la configuración institucional de la literatura argentina: Calixto Oyuela y Ricardo Rojas. Pondremos especial énfasis en las articulaciones que ambos autores proponen entre lengua y literatura nacional y en el debate que plantean en torno a la existencia al estatuto literario del Martín Fierro , de José Hernández, y a la existencia de una épica argentina. Según sostendremos, tanto en los planteos de Oyuela como en los de Rojas la épica es percibida como una poesía del origen racial de la comunidad nacional sobre cuya base se llevan adelante operaciones de inclusión y exclusión cultural, en el marco del desarrollo de políticas oficiales de unificación simbólica de la nación.",0,1

"Abstract The standard assumption that spec,CP is always an A′ position has been questioned for several languages where embedded C heads are involved in agreement and case assignment; however, the idea that no XP can be introduced in spec,CP by external merge has remained unchallenged. The article presents novel data from control phenomena in Mari (Uralic; nominative, SOV) and argues that, in this language, a particular type of C head is capable of thematically licensing an overt argument externally merged in spec,CP: the complementizer manən used in infinitival complement clauses projects a dative goal of communication. This behavior of manən follows from its dual nature: it is a semigrammaticalized verb ‘say’ that retains some lexical characteristics. I further suggest that the dative goal can be considered an overt realization of the addressee discourse variable, in line with the recent work on the presence of speaker , addressee , and logophoric center in syntax.",0,1
"William Labov launched the branch of language studies known as language variation and change or (more vaguely) sociolinguistics with several influential studies in the 1960s and seminal publications in the early 1970s. As the discipline spread to universities and research institutes in North America and, with remarkable rapidity, to Europe, Asia, the Antipodes, and ultimately all corners of the globe, Professor Labov has remained at or near the forefront of its various movements, including historical sociolinguistics, narrative analysis, sociometrics, subjective evaluation testing, educational and forensic applications, and sociophonetics, as well as mainstream variation studies. His breadth and depth as a scholar have influenced countless linguists and policy makers, and his enthusiasm and boundless optimism have inspired numerous colleagues, collaborators, and students. Several of them relate their personal experiences with the man and his ideas here.",0,1
"Abstract According to the Temporal Focus Hypothesis, people’s sagittal mental space-time mappings are conditioned by their temporal-focus attention. Based on this, it can be predicted that, by virtue of their future-oriented thinking, individuals with high anxiety should be more likely to think about time according to the future-in-front mapping than those with low anxiety. Utilizing a combined correlational and experimental approach, we found converging evidence for this prediction. Studies 1 and 2 found that individuals higher in dispositional anxiety and state anxiety, who characteristically worry about the future, were more likely to conceptualize the future as in front of them and the past as behind than individuals lower in dispositional anxiety and state anxiety. Study 3 showed that participants who were induced with anxiety mood tended to map the future on a frontal position, compared to those in the baseline condition. These findings shed further light on the Temporal Focus Hypothesis, thus providing the first experimental evidence that emotional experience can influence people’s temporal-focus attention in determining their metaphorical sagittal orientation of time.",0,1
"The revolution in metaphor studies has revealed the motivating presence of underlying conceptual metaphors in people’s use and understanding of metaphorical language and gesture. Metaphorical expression is typically viewed now as bodily enactment of mentally represented metaphorical concepts. My aim in this article is to advance the idea that metaphorical performances are always part of dynamical, ecological cognition and must always be characterized as embodied, enactive, embedded, and extended. The dynamical–ecological perspective emphasizes how human thought and action continuously change over time with metaphor, more specifically, emerging in partial and probabilistic ways given what particular ecologies best afford. I describe different metaphorical performances as they arise in varying situations as people face adaptive challenges. Part of my claim is that metaphorical meanings only exist within the context of their bodily articulations in specific ecological contexts. Embracing a dynamical–ecological approach to metaphor comes with the significant conclusion that metaphor is not a discrete event or activity that is suddenly “there” inside people’s minds but is a dynamical constraint on action that is distributed across brains, bodies, and real-world ecologies.",0,1

They observe that this periodical deals with many more subjects than those which French linguists often mean by the term “lexicon”, since we can find in it, for example, studies of conversational analysis or of prepositions. Nevertheless, it focuses essentially on three objects: lexical semantics, informing readers about the theories of the years 1980–1995; lexicography, the central object of the review, which analyses the lexicographical discourse of the long French tradition; and finally generative morpholexicology, the special field of Danielle Corbin, one of the founders of the review.

"This article explores the linguistic landscape (LL) of semi-informal markets in townships in the Tshwane (Pretoria) Metropolis in South Africa. Similar to other urban African markets, these LLs operate in a context of longstanding and ever-changing multilingualism and multiculturalism. Several indigenous and colonial South African languages are spoken in the area and many traders in the markets are immigrants from other African and South Asian countries. Despite this multilingualism, the public signage is dominated by English. The analysis draws on the semiotic reading of the LL by residents regarding the indexicality of traders’ names. Local sign writers provide insight into their instrumental role in shaping the LL of these areas. Furthermore, we draw on the notions of emplacement, spatial scope, and assemblages of semiotics to discuss the significance of mobile phone numbers in unregulated, potentially high-risk activities.",0,1

"Abstract There is an important relationship between scientific information and language. Scientific information is cumulative, storable and retrievable. In the past 40 years, English has become the dominant language of science information because the USA was the only major industrialized nation to come out of World War II with its industrial and educational infrastructures intact, because a great deal of scientific research was undertaken in the English-speaking world, because undertaking research requires access to information, and because all of these phenomena coincide with the historical point at which computer use became established in information storage. It is observable that the greatest users of information are also the greatest contributors to the pool of information and that those who most frequently use the information pool come to control the information systems. International accords have established the concept that information in the global networks must be written in or abstracted in English, French, German or Russian; it is clear that the dominant language is English. Access to information is central to national development and modernization; consequently, the science information/language relationship has important implications for Human Resource Development Planning and modernization. The actions of the Japanese government in the period since the end of World War II are examined as a case study. The situation in the People's Republic of China is also examined in order to suggest what China must do to achieve modernization with respect to information development, information storage, and information management.",0,1

"Children seem to be relatively delayed in their comprehension of the verbal be-passive in English, compared to their acquisition of other constructions of object-movement such as wh-questions and unaccusatives. Prior work has found that children’s performance on these passives can be affected by the verb’s lexical semantics. Through a meta-analysis of experimental studies assessing English-speaking children’s age of acquisition for the verbal be- passive, we identify a developmental trajectory composed of five classes, where each class has a distinct lexical semantic profile. A Truth-Value Judgment (TVJ) Task assessing English-speaking children’s comprehension of verbal be-passives supports this developmental trajectory. Together, the meta-analysis and TVJ study underscore the importance of lexical semantics for understanding the development of the English verbal be-passive.",0,1
"Abstract Translingual identity, as a part of the trans-paradigm, refers to linguistic, sociocultural, ethno-racial, and religious practices, which are negotiable, fluid, and in motion, transcending mainstream boundaries. This paper expands the translingual literature from the perspective of sociolinguistic disparities of culturally and linguistically diverse Eastern-European immigrant women in Australia, as they become victims of the perpetual foreigner stereotype in their host communities. Using the linguistic ethnography methods, such as open ethnographic observation and semi-structured interview, the study reveals that due to biographical accent, name, and the country of origin, as aspects of translingual identity – Australian-by-passport , those women become the victim of the perpetual foreigner stereotypes, such as ‘perceived as different’ and ‘Russian bride,’ which led to their feelings of inferiority and social inequality. By expanding the scope of the translingual identity and how it is perceived in Australia, this study provides a necessary contribution to the translingual literature, while simultaneously advocating for the quality of life and justice for translingual immigrants in their new home.",0,1

"A number of language acquisition patterns have been identified in the signing of a newly designated population of bimodal bilingual individuals—heritage signers. This article examines subject-referent tracking forms in the ASL (American Sign Language) narratives of six elementary-school-aged, native-signing, bimodal bilinguals made at different ages (5;02–6;09 and 6;07–8;02). These narratives are compared to those created by six Deaf counterparts (5;05–7;10) in a video-retelling task. The results show that, just as their Deaf peers, early bimodal bilinguals prefer nominal forms (for referent introduction and reintroduction) and null forms (for maintenance). However, the bimodal bilingual children increasingly diverge from their Deaf counterparts in the use of overt and fingerspelled forms. The increasing use of overt forms for maintenance and reintroduction is similar to patterns previously documented for heritage speakers, young unimodal bilinguals, and late bimodal bilinguals. Four of the six bimodal bilinguals showed an increased use of fingerspelled nominal forms for all discourse functions, yet these forms were rarely used by the Deaf children and instead were reserved for referent introduction. The greater prevalence of fingerspelled forms by the young bimodal",0,1
"This article presents a method of formant-to-area mapping consisting of the direct calculation of the time derivatives of the cross-sections and length of a vocal tract model so that the time derivatives of the observed formant frequencies and the model's eigenfrequencies match. The vocal tract model is a concatenation of uniform tubelets whose cross-section areas and lengths can vary in time. Time derivatives of the tubelet parameters are obtained by solving a linear algebraic system of equations. The derivatives are then numerically integrated to arrive at cross-section and length movements. Since more than one area function is compatible with the observed formant frequencies, pseudo-energy constraints are made use of to determine a unique solution. The results show that the formant-matched movements of the tubelet cross-sections and lengths are smooth, and that the agreement between the observed and model-generated formant frequencies is better than 0.01 Hz. Der Beitrag beschreibt eine Methode zur Berechnung der Form des Ansatzrohres ausgehend von akustischen Merkmalen des Sprachsignals. Die Methode erlaubt es die Ableitung der Entwicklung mit der Zeit der Form eines Sprachtraktusmodells so zu berechnen, daß die Eigenfrequenzen des Modells und beobachtete Formantfrequenzen übereinstimmen. Das Traktusmodell ist eine Aneinanderreihung von Rohren gleichmässigen Querschnitts mit der Möglichkeit diesen sowie die Rohrlänge zu verändern. Die Zeitableitung der Parameter der Rohre werden erhalten mit Hilfe der Lösung eines linearen algebraischen Gleichungssystems. Die Ableitungen werden dann numerisch integriert um den Zeitablauf der Form des Ansatzrohres zu erhalten. Wenn mehr als eine Ansatzrohrform mit den beobachteten Formantfrequenzen übereinstimmt, werden den kinetischen und potentiellen Pseudoenergien des Traktusmodells zusätzliche Bedingungen auferlegt, um das Erhalten einer eindeutigen Lösung zu ermöglichen. Die Resultate zeigen, daß die Bewegungsabläufe des Traktusmodells gleichmäßig sind und die Übereinstimmung zwischen Modelleigenfrequenzen und beobachteten Formantfrequenzen besser ist als 0.01 Hz. L'article présente une méthode d'inversion acoustico-géométrique basée sur le calcul direct des dérivées par rapport au temps des sections et longueurs d'un modèle du conduit vocal. Ce modèle du conduit est une concaténation de tubes uniformes dont la taille varie avec le temps. Les dérivées des sections et longueurs des tubes uniformes sont déterminées analytiquement de manière à faire coı̈ncider les fréquences propres du modèle du conduit et les fréquences des formants observées. Ces dérivées sont obtenues en résolvant un système algébrique linéaire d'équations. Elles sont intégrées numériquement pour aboutir aux mouvements des sections et longueurs. Des contraintes sur les pseudo-énergies potentielles et cinétiques sont imposées afin d'arriver à une solution unique. Les résultats montrent que la forme du modèle du conduit évolue de façon régulière. L'écart entre ses fréquences propres et les fréquences des formants observées est inférieur à 0.01 Hz.",0,1
"Les locutions prepositionnelles, intermediaires entre le groupe nominal prepositionnel (improvise) et la lexie (figee), se caracterisent par un continuum de degres de figements permettant un equilibre entre stabilite et variation. Un facteur determinant ce processus est le degre de selection semantique de la valeur de la preposition relativement a sa valeur centrale commune. Dans le cas de sous on montre que 1) cette preposition articule deux modalites sensorielles, la vision (sous = dissimulation) et le toucher (sous = etre en position gravitationnellement dominee par un objet-repere), et que 2) lorsque la preposition est inscrite dans une locution, il est fait un choix univoque de l'une de ces valeurs a l'exclusion de l'autre, valeur servant de base a la derivation metaphorique.

"Linguistic analyses of the Question Under Discussion (QUD) provide an interesting extension to Tony Sanford’s work on discourse coherence (e.g., Sanford & Emmott, 2012). The QUD approach claims that discourse is organized by a series of overt and covert questions and answers to, or comments on, them. In a coherent discourse, material that addresses the current QUD receives focus, and its processing is facilitated. After a brief review of the existing literature showing that the QUD affects discourse processing, we describe several lines of our own published research on the QUD and briefly present two new experiments. We first review the effects of overt questions on sentence comprehension, arguing that sentences that are thematically and syntactically congruent with the bias of an overt preceding question are processed faster than ones that require a syntactic and thematic shift. We present new evidence suggesting that assertions that address the focused element of a preceding question are likely to receive an exhaustive interpretation. Turning to covert questions, we review evidence that modals and other indications of the uncertain possibility of some event introduce a QUD about the occurrence of that event, biasing and facilitating comprehension of sentences that address such a QUD. Finally, we present new evidence suggesting that although sentential assertions in a discourse are likely to be taken to address an implicit QUD introduced by the antecedent of a conditional, elliptical assertions still tend to find their antecedents in a phrase whose structure is readily available. Thus, although satisfying the requirements of the current QUD is one factor that affects discourse comprehension, it is actually just one of many.",0,1

"This study investigates the actuation and propagation of sound change in Western Andalusian Spanish (WAS) by examining the change from pre- to post-aspiration in intervocalic /s/ + voiceless stop sequences (i.e., /sp st sk/). We collected read-speech data from 30 WAS speakers and 30 comparison speakers of North-Central Peninsular Spanish (NCPS). The results show that the shift toward post-aspiration is most advanced in /st/-words, as compared to /sp/- and /sk/-words, which we take as evidence that actuation likely occurred in the coronal context. We additionally demonstrate how post-aspiration is integrating into the wider WAS sound system: (i) post-aspirated stops undergo closure voicing in a fashion akin to plain stops; and (ii) the post-aspirated pattern is now emerging in phonological environments that historically lacked coda-/s/, namely in the stop + /t/ context. An important contribution of this study concerns the likely role played by the coronal context (i.e., /st/-words) during both the actuation and propagation stages of the sound change. We situate the findings within frameworks suggesting that actuation and propagation are systematically connected phases of sound change rather than wholly independent processes.",0,1
"In this paper an integrationist linguist (Peter E Jones) and an Ecological Psychologist (Catherine Read) open a dialogue on the possibility of a productive relationship between the integrationist approach to language and communication of Roy Harris and James Gibson's Ecological Psychology of perceiving/acting/knowing. Within their own disciplinary contexts, each position is one of profound critique and innovation in relation to established and pervasive ‘myths’. Specifically, Harris is concerned with the ‘language myth’—the explicit positions and implicit assumptions in the Western language tradition (including modern linguistics) about the nature of language and the relationship between language and communication. In sharp contrast to mainstream approaches, Harris rejects both coding and representational views of meaning and takes signs (including linguistic signs) to be the product, rather than the precondition, of communicational activity. Similarly, Gibson critiques assumptions about how perception takes place, especially in the case of vision, that have informed Western science at least since Descartes' Optics. In particular, Gibson rejects the passive ‘retinal image fallacy’ of seeing in favour of an activity based non-representational perspective of ‘direct perception’. The paper offers a critical dialogue over the key theoretical perspectives of both traditions, focusing particularly on the import and implications of each theorist's claims and assumptions about the other's field. Highlighting key areas of apparent common ground across the two approaches, we also argue that Gibson appears not to be entirely free of assumptions about language that belong to Harris's ‘language myth’, while Harris appears at times to assume the ‘image’ based model of perception that Gibson rejected. In the context of current interest in a possible reconciliation or combination of integrational linguistics and Ecological Psychology, the paper, therefore, raises fundamental questions around the extent to which these independently developed programmes of demythologization are compatible or possibly synergistic.",0,1

"For sentences where the object is coreferent with the subject of the clause (i.e., reflexive sentences), Upriver Halkomelem uses either a special reflexive suffix or the regular object suffix. Given what we know about the distribution of dedicated reflexive forms, the Upriver Halkomelem pattern is unexpected. In this paper, I argue that the special reflexive forms of Upriver Halkomelem are lexicalized and, as a consequence, they cannot block the occurrence of regular object suffixes in a reflexive environment. With this analysis, many of the special properties of Upriver Halkomelem reflexives fall out without further stipulation. Finally, I argue that the apparent “reflexive” use of the “intransitive” suffix (-em) in Upriver Halkomelem derives from the syntax of inalienable possession.",0,1

"Las relaciones causales pueden ser directas (e.g., cuando una bola golpea a otra) o indirectas (e.g., cuando una bola golpea a un objeto intermediario que posteriormente golpea a una segunda bola). Mientras se ha hipotetizado que las relaciones causales directas son detectadas automaticamente por regiones cerebrales asociadas a la vision, se ha mostrado que las representaciones semanticas median la percepcion de relaciones causales indirectas. La investigacion psicolinguistica ha mostrado que oraciones lexicas como ‘la bola anaranjada mueve a la bola purpura’ tienden a describir exclusivamente relaciones directas, mientras oraciones perifrasticas como ‘la bola anaranjada hace mover la bola purpura’ describen tanto las relaciones directas como las indirectas. Por tanto, la estructura perifrastica conferiria una ventaja semantica en la representacion de relaciones causales. Esta ventaja podria estar implementada mediante actividad descendente de regiones frontales a las occipitales visuales y parietales del cerebro. Mediante resonancia magnetica nuclear funcional perseguimos identificar la actividad neural que subyace a la representacion perifrastica causativa en la percepcion causal durante la lectura de instrucciones lexicas y perifrasticas. Se observo mayor actividad en regiones frontales, la precuna y la corteza visual secundaria cuando los participantes leian la instruccion perifrastica comparada con la instruccion lexica. Estos hallazgos son interpretados como indices de actividad anticipatoria de areas visuales moduladas por influencias frontales descendentes de la representacion semantica de la estructura perifrastica causativa.",0,1

"Writing in Slang To-day and Yesterday (1933), his pioneering history of the lexical subset that would become his life's work, Eric Partridge, who in time would become the 20 th century's leading expert in its lexis, pondered the etymology of the word ‘slang’. It was, he confessed, a ‘prize-problem word’. 82 years on, and 36 since the death at 85 of the man whose many fans would nickname him ‘The Word King’, it is hard to avoid feeling that in terms of his work and the reputation it brought him, it was Partridge too who represents a ‘prize problem.’",0,1
"Abstract In the ultimate chapter of his last and posthumously published work, Dik (1997b) calls for a “functional grammar of discourse”. Whereas Functional Grammar (FG) was originally conceived of as a grammar of smaller units, variously identified in Dik's work as “predications”, “linguistic expressions” and “clauses”, his final contribution to linguistics consisted in a sketch of his views on a question that has been very prominent in FG work in the nineties: what is the relation between clause structure and discourse structure? The fact that the phrase “functional grammar of discourse” can be parsed in two ways reflects the two major answers to this question offered in FG work hitherto. The parsing [functional grammar [of discourse]] invokes various proposals to extend the existing hierarchical framework of FG to cover the structure of discourse; the parsing [functional [grammar of discourse] ], in contrast, suggests that discourse has a structure sui generis, but a structure that is best approached from the general philosophical perspective shared by Functional Grammar, with discourse being linked to grammar at best through some interface.",0,1

"This issue of Seminars in Speech and Language focuses on the concept of engagement. As used in this issue, the term engagement is defined as the level of interpersonal involvement that people display in social situations. Engagement is signaled in a variety of ways. For example, gaze can signal engagement or disengagement in conversation. When a listener gazes and orients his or her body in the direction of a speaker, it tends to signal interest and involvement in the conversation. Conversely, gaze aversion and body orientation away from a speaker can signal lack of attention and “disengagement” from the conversation.",0,1
"This article addresses the problem of the inconsistency of the frequencies reported by the commercial search engines Google and Yahoo, assessing their reliability for academic use and seeking ways to use them more safely for language research and learning. The main part of the article is the presentation of three tests on the self-consistency and relational consistency of search engine frequencies and their results showing some important patterns. It is found that despite occasional frequency shifts of large magnitude, the engines (especially Yahoo) generally maintain a reasonable degree of self-consistency. However, some of the Google frequencies were apparently incorrect as indicated by their relational inconsistency. The tests are preceded by an overview of search engine uses and problems and a discussion of ‘query cache’, which is an essential component of the frequency mechanism providing a possible explanation of search engine behaviors. In conclusion, a search strategy and ways of carrying this work further to develop a model of search engine use are proposed.",0,1
"0. This paper is a morphophonemic and morphemic study of a class of Romanian words defined by their inflectional behavior as nouns. The point of departure is an array of isolated examples in phonemic form; the result is a classification of nouns by morphological types and a morphemic formula. The corpus from which the examples are drawn consists of Romanian texts' interpreted with the aid of native speakers, supplemented with utterances by the speakers themselves.2 The underlying phonemic analysis is the author's. Phonemic data are here given for orientation only; they do not pretend to be a complete presentation of Romanian phonology. The phonemes of standard Romanian3 are the following: SYLLABIC: two front vowels /i e/, three central vowels /i a a/, and two back vowels /u o/, of which /i i u/ are high, /ea ~/ are mid, /a/ is low; NONSYLLABIC: six labial consonants /p b f v m w/, eight alveolar consonants /t d c s z n 1 r/, five palatal consonants /6 g A j/, and three velar consonants /k g h/; ACCENTUAL: one stress /'/ and three pitches /1 2 3/;4 JUNCTURAL: one phraseinternal juncture /+/ and three phrase-final junctures /I II ./. The language has phonological words, defined as free forms with a single stress, e.g. /kibriturile/ 'the matches', /deobi66j/ 'usually', /umpri6ten/ 'a friend'. It also has morphological words; without recourse to syntax one can isolate four classes by the type of inflection which they exhibit in paradigms: nouns, pronouns, adjectives, and verbs.5 We are here concerned exclusively with nouns.",0,1
"Experimental studies show that children have greater difficulty with wh-extraction from object position than subject position, arguably an intervention effect (e.g., Relativized Minimality). In this study we provide additional evidence of a S/O asymmetry in A’-dependencies from a novel source—sluicing. The results of our first comprehension study show that English-speaking 3–6-year-olds obey the “identity condition” on sluicing—that is, they disallow interpretations in which the elided verb or arguments are distinct from their antecedent. Importantly, our results also show a subject > object asymmetry and thereby support syntactic theories of sluicing that posit a fully articulated (but unpronounced) TP at the ellipsis site from which the wh-phrase has been extracted, e.g., Someone wrote this paper, but I don’t know who <_ wrote this paper>, as opposed to certain semantic/pragmatic theories that posit no such structure. Our second comprehension study investigates the role of animacy. We find that children’s comprehension of object sluices, but not subject sluices, improves significantly when there is a mismatch in animacy features. Our results are incompatible with models that are solely frequency based but rather provide evidence for structure-based intervention effects. We conclude that subject > object asymmetries can be found even in instances in which the intervener is not overt, such as sluicing, and that [animacy] may be a feature involved in the computation of intervention.",0,1

"The elision of V2 in root-suffix hiatus contexts has previously been alluded to as the need to preserve V1 when it belongs to a prominent position (a phenomenon known as positional faithfulness) such as a root or a content word. This article suggests a new factor: certain prosodic domains impose their own pattern of vowel elision in hiatus contexts. The prosodic stem in CiTonga, a southern Bantu language spoken in Malawi, for instance, requires that hiatus within it be resolved through elision of V2, and not V1. V2 elision in clitic-clitic contexts also suggests that clitics in this language are most likely parsed by the prosodic stem, thereby creating a right-edge misalignment between a morphological stem and a prosodic stem. The parsing of clitics by the prosodic stem in CiTonga is unlike other languages (e.g. Zezuru, a dialect or variant of the Shona language) where clitics are parsed by the prosodic word.",0,1
"Research article (RA) abstracts succinctly and skilfully epitomize the core information of the full text and have thus attracted the attention of a number of scholars. While previous studies mainly focused on the rhetorical structures, meta-discursive features and lexico-grammatical features, few have made explorations from the perspective of information theory. To bridge this gap, the present study conducted an entropy-based analysis to explore the distribution pattern of information content across moves and the variations across disciplines. 318 RA abstracts across the natural sciences, social sciences and humanities (106 abstracts per discipline) were selected and three indices, i.e. the 1-/ 2-/ 3-gram entropies, were used to examine whether different indices yielded different features. The results show that in an RA abstract, the information content is unevenly distributed across moves; different entropy indices may reflect different linguistic properties; and both similarities and variations exist in information content across disciplines. These phenomena can be attributed to the functions of moves, the linguistic meanings of indices and disciplinary features. This study has implications for RA abstract writing instruction and practice, as well as for broadening the applications of quantitative linguistic methods into less touched fields.",0,1
"Formulaic sequences in language use are often studied by means of the automatic identification of frequently recurring series of words, often referred to as ‘lexical bundles’, in corpora that contrast different registers, academic disciplines, etc. As corpora often differ in size, a critically important assumption in this field states that the use of a normalized frequency threshold, such as 20 occurrences per million words, allows for an accurate comparison of corpora of different sizes. Yet, several researchers have argued that normalization may be unreliable when applied to frequency threshold. The study investigates this issue by comparing the number of lexical bundles identified in corpora that differ only in size. Using two complementary random sampling procedures, subcorpora of 100,000 to two million words were extracted from five corpora, with lexical bundles identified in them using two normalized frequency thresholds and two dispersion thresholds. The results show that many more lexical bundles are identified in smaller subcorpora than in larger ones. This size effect can be related to the Zipfian nature of the distribution of words and word sequences in corpora. The conclusion discusses several solutions to avoid the unfairness of comparing lexical bundles identified in corpora of different sizes.",0,1

"We investigate bilingual children’s perception of assimilations, i.e. phonological rules by which a consonant at a word edge adopts a phonological feature of a neighboring consonant. For instance, English has place assimilation (e.g., green is pronounced with a final [m] in green pen), while French has voicing assimilation (e.g., sac is pronounced with a final [g] in sac vert “green bag”). Previous research has shown that French and English monolingual toddlers compensate for the assimilation rule of their language, correctly recovering the intended words, but not for a rule that does not exist in their language. Using a word recognition videogame with French sentences, we show that French-English bilingual 6-year-olds perform exactly like French monolinguals of the same age: they compensate for voicing but not for place assimilation. Thus, despite their dual language input they have acquired French voicing assimilation and show no interference from English place assimilation.",0,1
"DISCUSSION NOTE Scope, structure, and expert systems: A reply to Kuno et al. Joseph Aoun and Yen-hui Audrey Li University of Southern California This article is a reply to Kuno et al. 1999, which claims that a structural approach to scope should be replaced by an expert system. But the alleged theoretical and empirical problems faced by the structural accounts for scope are based on assumptions or interpretations that are not adopted in the structural accounts. Further, there are problems with the characterization and execution of the expert system, causing difficulty in the understanding and application of the system intra- and interlinguistically; the expert system is not empirically adequate and does not accommodate idiolectal variations. Finally, the expert system misses important correlations between scope and other properties in the grammar, such as binding, that follow straightforwardly from a structural approach. A structural approach to scope should not be abandoned in favor of an expert system.* Introduction. Kuno, Takami and Wu (1999) examine in great detail Aoun and Li's syntactic analysis of quantifier scope interaction (1993), further extending the discussion to other structural approaches, such as May 1977, 1985, Huang 1982, 1995, Hoji 1985, Williams 1986, 1988, Hornstein 1995, Kitahara 1996 and Stroik 1996, and raise the following three issues. (1) a. There are serious theoretical problems with Aoun and Li's syntactic account of scope interpretations for the double object and topicalization constructions b.There are ambiguous sentences that Aoun and Li's and other syntactic analyses predict to be unambiguous. c.There are unambiguous sentences that Aoun and Li's and other syntactic analyses predict to be ambiguous. Kuno et al. proceed to argue that, in order to achieve empirical adequacy, a syntactic account of quantifier scope interactions should be abandoned in favor of their expert system. They further suggest that wide idiolectal variations in quantifier scope interpretations are due to differences among speakers with respect to the relative weights that the relevant principles receive in their respective expert system. In this reply, we first address the issues raised in la and show that they result from some interpretations of Aoun and Li's work that are not necessarily warranted. We then discuss the empirical problems faced by the structural accounts as presented by Kuno et al. (Ib, c) and show that the alleged empirical problems are based on some assumptions that do not necessarily hold within the structural accounts. It is not the case that the expert system, briefly sketched in §2, is indeed more adequate as a theory of scope interactions. The establishment and execution ofthe experts are not as convincing as they are proposed to be. The empirical advantage of this expert system disappears * The writing of this reply would not have been possible without Richard Larson's help. Many of the important points in this paper are Larson's ideas. We are greatly indebted to him. We are also thankful for the comments from the Language referees and the help from the associate editor and the editor of Language. Any errors or misinterpretations are our responsibilities. 133 134LANGUAGE, VOLUME 76, NUMBER 1 (2000) when relevant data are more closely examined. Finally, the expert system misses important crosslinguistic correlations between scope and other properties in the grammar that are sensitive to structures, such as binding. Such correlations follow straightforwardly from the structural accounts. 1. Structures of double object and topic constructions. Let us begin with the issues raised in la. Kuno et al. argue that Aoun and Li's analysis of the double object and topicalization structures suffers from theoretical problems. 1.1. Double object constructions. In order to understand the alleged problem with the double object structures, we need to briefly sketch some aspects of Aoun and Li's analysis. Aoun and Li's analysis relies on two principles: the minimal binding requirement (MBR) in 2 and the scope principle in 3: (2)Minimal binding requirement (MBR): Variables must be bound by the most local potential A'-binder. (3)Scope principle: An operator A may have scope over an operator B iff A c-commands B or an A'-element in the chain headed by the operator. In the configuration 4, the quantificational...",0,1

"This article examines the distribution of gender in arguments in example sentences in contemporary linguistics publications. Prior studies have shown that example sentences in syntax textbooks systematically underrepresent women and perpetuate gender stereotypes (Macaulay & Brice 1994, 1997, Pabst et al. 2018). Here we examine example sentences in articles published over the past twenty years in Language, Linguistic Inquiry, and Natural Language & Linguistic Theory and find striking similarities to this prior work. Among our findings, we show a stark imbalance of male (N = 12,117) to female (N = 5,571) arguments, where male-gendered arguments are more likely to be subjects, and female-gendered arguments nonsubjects. We show that femalegendered arguments are more likely to be referred to using a kinship term, to exhibit positive emotions, and to be the object of affection, whereas male-gendered arguments are more likely to have occupations, to exhibit negative emotions, and to perpetrate violence. We show that this pattern has remained stable, with little change, over the course of the twenty years that we examine, leading up to the present day. We conclude with a brief discussion of possible remedies and suggestions for improvement.",0,1
"Quoique la norme du français standard prescrive le double marquage de la négation dans le syntagme verbal ( ne . . . pas ), l'usage contemporain veut que le français parlé laisse tomber la première marque ( ne ). Dans un article de 1981 qui s'appuyait sur un corpus de français oral enregistré à Tours en 1976, Ashby avait mis en lumière une forte co-variation entre la chute du ne et l'âge du locuteur, les jeunes omettant beaucoup plus souvent le ne que les personnes plus âgées. Cette distribution semble relever d'un changement en temps apparent. Pourtant, comme le signale Labov (1994), un trait linguistique plus fréquent chez les jeunes ne représente pas nécessairement un changement en cours. On peut supposer qu'il s'agit d'un phénomène lié à l'effet de génération (age grading), phénomène dans lequel les locuteurs alterent leur comportement linguistique au cours de leur vie tandis que la grammaire de la communauté ne change pas. De manière à trancher entre les deux hypothèses (d'un côté, changement en cours; de l'autre, effet de génération), cette étude établit une comparaison des distributions de la variable ( ne ) à deux époques différentes: le corpus tourangeau de 1976 est doublé d'un nouveau corpus enregistré en 1995 au même endroit. Cette comparaison démontre que, sur le plan du temps réel, la chute du ne s'est accélérée, ce qui sous-tend donc l'hypothèse du changement en cours.",0,1
"The aim of this paper is to present a description of the statistic survey since it constitutes an instrument traditionally related to the quantitative research and orientated towards social structure observation and analysis. The search for social object quantification has always been one of the most outstanding tendencies in the elaboration process of scientific knowledge, mainly from positivist theoretical perspectives. In some areas of sociolinguistic research the pertinence of surveys is obvious. After defining and contextualising surveys, we present a tipology and a section about the questionaire, which is the means of communication between the reasearcher and the analysed population. Then, we pay attention to the selection of observation unities and refer to the most important features of random and non-random samples. Finally, we offer a specific section about data treatment and we mention those most relevant theoretical aspects of descriptive and inferential statistics.",0,1
"Contemporary artists often deliberately challenge viewers employing a wide range of means that include different variants of ambiguity. In this study we focus on how inconsistencies relating to a painting's content (presence of semantic violations) and title (its semantic incoherence with what is depicted in the painting) influence aesthetic judgement, namely the liking and understanding of contemporary artworks. We also tested if personality traits relate to appreciation of ambiguous works of art and subjective understanding of paintings with semantic violations. Participants (naïve viewers) viewed reproductions of paintings both with and without semantic violations in one of three conditions: with a coherent title, with an incoherent title, or without a title. We showed that need for cognitive closure was negatively correlated with aesthetic liking – but only in the case of paintings with semantic violations, and it was not correlated with understanding. Openness was positively correlated with liking and subjective understanding. In line with our hypotheses, paintings without semantic violations were subjectively understood less when equipped with incoherent, rather than coherent, titles. By contrast, the incoherence of the title did not influence the evaluation of paintings with semantic violations. Moreover, paintings with semantic violations were both liked less and understood less than paintings without violations. In sum, our results suggest the positive effect of fluency and openness to experience on the liking and understanding of contemporary paintings by naïve observers.",0,1

"Pater’s (2019) target article proposes that neural networks will provide theories of learning that generative grammar lacks. We argue that his enthusiasm is premature since the biases of neural networks are largely unknown, and he disregards decades of work on machine learning and learnability. Learning biases form a two-way street: all learners have biases, and those biases constrain the space of learnable grammars in mathematically measurable ways. Analytical methods from the related fields of computational learning theory and grammatical inference allow one to study language learning, neural networks, and linguistics at an appropriate level of abstraction. The only way to satisfy our hunger and to make progress on the science of language learning is to confront these core issues directly.",0,1
"This study analyses the structure of lexical roots in the Lamalamic languages of Cape York Peninsula, in the northeast of Australia. The analysis shows how Lamalamic roots are shaped diachronically by processes of erosion and expansion, leading to root forms that are unusual by Australian standards. Erosion processes include the loss of initial consonants, resulting in vowel-initial roots, and the loss of entire initial syllables, resulting in monosyllabic roots. Expansion processes include leftward expansion through the addition of meaningless VC prefixes, and rightward expansion through morphological augmentation and subsequent semantic bleaching. The analysis describes the basic processes involved for the languages, using historical-comparative and phonotactic evidence, and brings out two points of more general relevance. First, the analysis proposes an analogy-based mechanism to explain loss of initial vowels, which complements the classic account in terms of gradual initial weakening. Second, the analysis also suggests that erosion and expansion processes may be functionally related, in that there is some evidence that expansion processes could originate in a mechanism to counterbalance the development of monosyllables.",0,1

"Scholar failure is a complex phenomenon that depends on various factors as social factors, scholar factors or biophysical factors. But, in primary and secondary education system scholar failure has different causes from tertiary education system. In our paper we analyze a specific case of university student failure, the case of the Faculty of Cybernetics, Statistics and Economic Informatics from the Bucharest University of Economics. The main causes of student failure in the analyzed situation are: internal (personal) factors and external factors (family situation, social pressure, economic pressure) but also factors as disciplines difficulty (many technical disciplines), teacher's exigency, pedagogical and economic difficulties.",0,1
"In Persian, two of the verbal constructions used for expressing futurity – the Past Simple and the Future Simple – are built around the past form of the main verb. This paper seeks to demystify this connection between the past and the future by investigating how these past forms contribute to the expression of futurity and setting this within an overall analysis of the future constructions in this language. Based on the form of the main verb in 940 sentences with verbal future constructions, six constructions were identified and categorized into future-oriented past constructions (FPST), which include the Past Simple and the Future Simple, and future-oriented present constructions (FPRT), which include the Present Simple, the Present Progressive, the Present Subjunctive and the WANT construction. A construction grammar approach together with Reichenbach and neo-Reichenbach terminology was then utilized to distinguish the differing relations between tense, aspect, mood and speaker perspective, and assign syntactic-semantic maps in terms of features such as level of formality, perfectness, intended future, certainty and inner aspect (aktionsart) to each of the FPST and FPRT constructions. It is argued that the use of the past form of the main verb in the Past Simple and the Future Simple (FPST constructions) owes much to aspectual and ontological factors, with the past element indicating certainty, perfectness and a speaker perspective of looking back.",0,1
"Abstract Multichannel noise reduction in the frequency domain is a fundamental problem in the areas of speech processing and speech recognition. In this paper, we address this problem and propose an alternative approach to retrieve a speech signal out of microphone array noisy observations. We focus on the spectral amplitude of the speech signal and assume that the spectral phase is less significant. The estimate of the spectral amplitude squared, that is the spectral power, is obtained by applying a complex linear filter to a modified version of the observations vector. This modified version is obtained as a Kronecker product of the complex conjugate of the observations vector and the original observations vector. The complex speech signal estimate is obtained by multiplying the spectral amplitude estimate with a complex exponential whose phase may be extracted from the minimum variance distortionless response beamformer. We present a modified optimization criterion according to which the proposed filters may be derived, and compare their performances to conventional multichannel noise reduction filters. We show that the new approach is preferable, in particular when the input signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is low or the number of sensors is small.",0,1
"1. The numeral classifiers2 of Thai constitute an important syntactic wordclass of the language and are employed with all nouns denoting objects which may be counted (e.g. 'man', 'house', 'word'). In most cases it is impossible to devise rules which will serve as an infallible guide in choosing the proper classifier to be employed with any given noun. For this reason it is desirable to memorize the classifier to be used with a noun at the same time that one learns the noun, just as in French or German one must memorize the gender of each",0,1

"Abstract Previous studies have brought conflicting results regarding the effects of valence and arousal in visual word processing. Some authors have pointed to participants’ individual differences as one of the possible explanations for these inconsistencies. The main aim of the present research was to examine whether participants’ individual differences in the level of epistemically unwarranted beliefs (EUB) contribute to these conflicting results. Therefore, participants who varied in their level of paranormal, pseudoscientific and conspiracy beliefs (assessed by self-report measures) performed a lexical decision task (LDT) and a recognition memory task. Linear mixed-effects models over LDT response times revealed that the effects of words’ emotional content (both valence and arousal) were modulated by the degree of individuals’ EUB. In addition, signal detection theory analyses showed that in the recognition task (but not in the LDT) response bias became more liberal as individuals’ EUB increased. These patterns of effects were not general to all EUB instances. The obtained results highlight the need to consider participants’ individual differences in affective word processing and signal detection. In addition, this study reveals some basic psychological mechanisms that would underlie EUB, a fact that has both theoretical and applied relevance.",0,1
"Regionale Sprachgeschichte erhebt den Anspruch, die Entwicklung des Deutschen nicht bloß teleologisch im Hinblick auf die moderne Gemeinsprache darzustellen, sondern die je eigenen Entwicklungen in den Regionen nachzuzeichnen, auch jene, die sich vom neuhochdeutschen Standpunkt aus als “Umwege” oder “Irrwege” herausgestellt haben. Zurecht machen die Herausgeber des anzuzeigenden Buchs aber schon in ihrem Vorwort klar, dass letztlich auch regionale Sprachgeschichte auf die Gemeinsprache ausgerichtet ist: Sie ist eine Geschichte der Gemeinsprache, in der die Regionen ihr Wort mitzureden haben, und sie wird deshalb auch die mündlichen Sprachformen systematischer einbeziehen, in denen das Sprachregionale sozusagen inkarniert ist.

"Mainland Scandinavian languages have been reported to allow movement from embedded questions, relative clauses, and complex NPs—domains commonly considered to be islands crosslinguistically. Yet in formal acceptability studies Scandinavian participants often show 'island effects': they reject island-violating movement similarly to native speakers of 'island-sensitive' languages. To investigate this apparent mismatch between informal and formal judgments, we conducted two acceptability judgment experiments testing the acceptability of topicalization from various island domains in Norwegian. We were interested in determining whether we could (i) find evidence for island insensitivity and (ii) pin down the source of qualitatively different island effects. We asked whether such effects are best explained as reflecting violations of a uniform syntactic constraint or extrasyntactic factors. Our results suggest that embedded questions and relative clauses are not uniform syntactic islands for topicalization, but complex NPs are. Unexpectedly, we also found evidence suggesting that conditional adjunct clauses may not be islands.",0,1
"Abstract This article focuses on children's language alternation practices in two primary school settings. More specifically we explore how participants (children and teachers) in episodes of language alternation invoke linguistic and social identities, thereby ‘talking into being’ language and educational ideologies. The present study is based on multi-sited ethnography in two multiethnic educational settings where classroom activities are primarily in Swedish. Theoretically, it draws on sequential identity-related approaches to language alternation practices (Gafaranga, 2001 Gafaranga, J. 2001. Linguistic identities in talk-in-interaction: Order in bilingual conversation. Journal of Pragmatics, 33: 1901–1925. [Crossref], [Web of Science ®] , [Google Scholar]). As demonstrated, both children and teachers draw on a range of linguistic varieties, and refrained from involving in polylingual practices. In so doing, they were actively engaged in producing and resisting a range of locally valued identities (i.e. monolingual, bilingual, and polylingual student). Simultaneously a monolingual norm was brought into being and, importantly, the children appropriated and exploited the monolingual norms-in being for organising their social relations. Overall the study highlights the links between social and linguistic identities, language choice, and language and educational ideologies. We argue that an understanding of children's polylingual practices in multilingual settings is provided by a close analysis of the local processes of identity work located within the wider sociocultural context (e.g. language and educational ideologies).",0,1

Gabon has a multilingual and multicultural character resulting in a linguistic and sociolinguistic environment that must be taken into account in the compilation of dictionaries. Compared to simple articles, synopsis articles offer a better approach to the transfer of linguistic and cultural information in dictionaries. In other words, in Gabon, the focus should be on the use of synopsis articles in dictionaries that must be compiled to take into account and convey in these works the linguistic and cultural diversity of this country. This is very important because the utilisation of synopsis articles does not depend on dictionary typology. The aim of this article is to suggest different methodological approaches for which lexicographers and compilers of dictionaries can use synopsis articles to present linguistic and cultural data. These methodological approaches take into account the use of these articles in different types of dictionaries. These developments will be discussed and evaluated for their ability to present and treat the encyclopedic aspect of lexical items. The emphasis will not only be on the treatment of synopsis articles in the central list, but also on back matter texts that can also contain a text with a list of all the items which are the treatment units of these articles in this central part of the dictionary. In other words, the focal point of this article is directed at the level of the utilisation of synopsis articles in the central list which will be completed by alphabetical registers in the back matter texts for the compilation of different types of dictionaries which will be polyaccessible in offering to users rapid access means to reach both linguistic and cultural data.Keywords: SYNOPSIS ARTICLE, TYPES OF MACROSTRUCTURES, SINGLE ARTICLE, LEMMA SIGN, LINGUISTIC AND EXTRALINGUISTIC ASPECTS, TARGET GROUP, DATA CATEGORIES, CULTURE-BOUND LEXICAL ITEMS",0,1

La actitud se relaciona con la certeza, la obligacion o cualquier sistema de valores. Incluye el afecto, el juicio y la apreciacion, y los valores pueden ser positivos o negativos. A traves del analisis de un corpus constituido por veinte articulos publicados en la revista Medicina (diez de 1940-1941 y diez de 2002-2003), determinamos que la evaluacion se lleva a cabo fundamentalmente por medio de recursos lexicos y, en particular, mediante cuantificadores. Tambien poseen un rasgo evaluativo ciertos verbos, como apreciar o preferir, y los verbos de medida, como aumentar o disminuir, que indican una valoracion vinculada al contexto. Entre ambos grupos de textos se observan diferencias en los esquemas de evaluacion: en los de la primera etapa predominan las estructuras de obligacion y la presencia del agente evaluador. Los de la segunda etapa, en cambio, muestran una menor evaluacion explicita y baja presencia de los autores en el texto",0,1
"The variation in prosodic features were studied in an investigation of exposure to 12 combinations of three environmental factors: dry bulb temperature (20°C, 35°C), stable broadband noise (90 dBA), and stochastic (2.8–11.2 Hz) as well as sinusoidal (5 Hz) whole body vibration along the z-axis. Sixty healthy, young male subjects read a text which was easy, familiar, and emotionally neutral. Fundamental frequency, intensity, spectral characteristics of voice and timing of speech were found to change reliably on the group level according to the exposure combination. Oral diadochokinesis (repetition of syllables /ta/ and /pa/) did not change significantly, whereas the repetition of non-sense words (/tapaka/, pataka/) was sensitive to exposure. Exposure to 20°C only, exposure to noise only and exposure to stochastic vibration combined to other environmental factors caused fatigue and a drop in arousal. Whereas exposure to sinusoidal 5 Hz vibration in different combinations rised arousal. Any single prosodic variable is not enough for assessing a person's psychophysiological state. Our findings support the view that the changes in arousal and consequently, in speech characteristics are exposure-specific. Die Variation von prosodischen Charakteristika wurde untersucht. Hiefür wurden gesunde, junge, männliche Versuchspersonen 12 verschiedenen Kombinationen von drei Umweltfaktoren ausgesetzt: trockene Temperatur (20°C, 35°C) breitbandiges Rauschen mit konstantem Schalldruckpegel (90 dBA), stochastische (2.8–11.2 Hz) sowie sinusoidale(5 Hz) Ganzkörpervibrationen in der z-Richtung. Sechzig Versuchspersonen lasen einen leichten, ihnen schon vorher bekannten und emotional neutralen Text. Grundtonhöle, Stimmintensität, Rythmus der Sprache und Sprachspektralcharakteristika veränderten sich auf Gruppenbasis verlässlich entsprechend der verwendeten Stresskombination. Die orale Diadochokinese (/ta/, /pa/) schien im Gegensatz zu der Wiederholung von unsinnigen Wörten (/tapaka/, /pataka/), gegenüber der Stressexposition unempfindlich zu sein. Bei der Untersuchung der prosodischen Charakteristika bewirkten nicht nur die alleinige Lärmexposition und die stochastische Vibrationexposition in verschiedenen Kombinationen Müdigkeit und einen Konzentrationsabfall, sondern auch das Nichtvorhandensein von Stressfaktoren. Die 5 Hz Sinusvibrationexposition, verschiedenartig kombiniert, bewirkte emotionalen Stress. Für die Bewertung der emotionalen Situation reicht das Verhalten eines einzelnen prosodischen Charakteristikums nich aus. Unsere Ergebnisse stützen die psychophysiologische These, dass es keine monolithische Stressreaktion gibt, sondern die Veränderungen der Variablen expositionsspezifisch sind. Nous avons étudié la variation des traits prosodiques d'échantillons de lecture chez 60 sujets soumis à 12 combinaisons de 3 facteurs: la température (20°C, 35°C), bruit stable à large bande (90 dBA), et vibrations stochastiques (2, 8–11, 2 Hz) et sinusoïdales (5 Hz) du corps. Les sujets, hommes jeunes et en bonne santé, ont lu un texte facile, familier et émotionnellement neutre. La fréquence fondamentale, l'intensité, les caractéristiques spectrales et temporelles de la voix ont subi des modifications significatives selon les diverses combinaisons de l'exposition aux 3 conditions de stress. La diadochocinèse (répétition de syllabes /pa/ et /ta/ n'a pas été modifiée de manière significative alors que la répétition des logatomes /tapaka/ et /pataka/ s'est révélée sensible aux stress. Nous avons aussi constaté que l'exposition à la seule température de 20°C, l'exposition au bruit seul et l'exposition à la vibration stochastique combinée à d'autres facteurs environnementaux ont causé de la fatigue et une chute de la vigilance. Par contre, les vibrations sinusoïdales de 5 Hz dans différentes combinaisons ont augmenté la vigilance. On ne peut pas évaleur l'état psychophysiologique d'un individu à l'aide d'une seule variable prosodique. Nos résultats renforcent le point de vue selon lequel il n'existe pas de réaction psychophysiologique monolithique aux stress et que les changements dans l'état de vigilance et, en conséquence, dans les caractéristisques de la parole sont spécifiques aux conditions d'exposition.",0,1
"Abstract: Darwinism consists of two parts: a phylogenesis of biological species (ours included) and the claim that the primary mechanism of the evolution of phenotypes is natural selection. I assume that Darwin’s account of phylogeny is essentially correct; attention is directed to the theory of natural selection. I claim that Darwin’s account of evolution by natural selection cannot be sustained. The basic problem is that, according to the consensus view, evolution consists in changes of the distribution of phenotypic traits in populations of organisms. An evolutionary theory must therefore explicate not just the notion of organisms being selected, but also the notion of organisms being selected for their phenotypic traits. I argue that that there is no way for a theory of natural selection to do so, and that Darwin’s assumption to the contrary was likely the consequence of placing too much weight on the analogy between natural selection and artificial selection. The paper ends with the suggestion that selectionist explanations, insofar as they are convincing, are best construed as post hoc historical narratives: natural history rather than biology.",0,1
"Cet article propose de s’intéresser à l’interaction intervenant dans un cadre médiatique et plus particulièrement dans le débat Question Time. Les participants au débat forment des communautés discursives bien distinctes : journalistes, hommes politiques ou simples citoyens.

Après avoir rappelé certaines données concernant l’aspect culturel du débat-panel et les milieux dont proviennent les participants, certaines stratégies langagières, telles que les positionnements énonciatifs et la planification discursive, sont étudiées. L’analyse montre que l’opposition dont font preuve certains journalistes à l’égard des politiciens ainsi que le schéma de la double pyramide que ceux-ci pratiquent rapprochent les deux communautés. L’emprunt et l’adoption des pratiques de l’autre aboutissent à un déplacement des bornes au profit de la création d’une « communauté culturelle » liée à une situation de communication particulière.",0,1

"During face-to-face communication, people use visual cues about what their partners are attending to as they process language. An eyetracking experiment explored how addressees use speakers’ eye gaze and head orientation while interpreting references to objects in a spatial task. Thirty-six naive director/matcher pairs seated face-to-face were separated by a low or high barrier that hid identical mirror-image arrangements of objects. We compared matchers’ ability to disambiguate referring expressions when directors’ eyes and heads were visible over the barrier, when only directors’ heads were visible (with eyes obscured by mirrored sunglasses), or when directors were completely hidden. Seeing directors’ head orientation helped matchers quickly restrict attention to the target side of the display. Seeing directors’ eye gaze helped matchers disambiguate referring expressions earlier (before the linguistic point of disambiguation) than did seeing head orientation alone. Along with benefits, however, there were some costs to monitoring eye gaze in face-to-face communication.",0,1
"The article attempts a first conspectus of what is known about interdisciplinary con-tacts between the fields of Lexicography and Linguistics, and in the process asks a range of fundamental questions on whether and how the subject matter is shared, and how we can improve mutual relations. Firstly, some opinions and arguments in the literature are reviewed, with par-ticular attention to (a) what criteria determine the status of a discipline, (b) how various relations between Lexicography and Linguistics can be modelled, (c) how practice and theory interact, and (d) what parallels there are between the two disciplines, in terms of such notions as description, codification and remediation. Secondly, views from the position of Linguistics are categorised his-torically and systematically, first by tracing the development from historical comparative or dia-chronic linguistics (philology) to structural-descriptive (synchronic) linguistics as well as applied linguistics, and then by combining five of the linguistic 'levels' with the three semiotic 'dimensions', and relating them to various interdisciplinary or problem-solving fields, such as sociolinguistics and computational linguistics. Thirdly, several points of view in Lexicography are presented, and an explicit framework is developed for displaying its place relative to its 'mother', 'sister' and 'daughter' disciplines as well as some of its 'data-supplying' disciplines, paying special attention to the problem of methodology. Fourthly, as a special case study, the territory of 'onomasiology' is discussed to illustrate the limitations and possibilities of various approaches to the analysis, de-scription and lexicographic presentation of synonym and antonym sets of vocabulary. The conclusion is reached that ways must be found to understand the interdisciplinary nature of Lexico-graphy, and a plea is made to move from mutual neglect to deliberate collaboration.

"An accurate characterization of the morphology of the hard palate is essential for understanding its role in human speech. The position of the tongue is adjusted in the oral cavity, of which the hard palate is a key anatomical structure. Methods for modeling the palate are limited at present. This paper evaluated the use of a thin plate spline (TPS) technique for reconstructing the palate surface from a series of in-vivo tracings obtained with electromagnetic articulography using Wave (NDI). Twenty-four individuals (13 females and 11 males) provided upper dental casts and in-vivo tracings. Models of the palate surfaces were derived from data acquired in-vivo and compared to the scanned casts. The optimal value for the smoothness parameter for the TPS technique, which provided the smallest error of fit between the modeled and scanned surfaces, was determined empirically (the value of 0.05). Significant predictors of the quality of the fit were determined and included the individuals’ palate characteristics such as palate slope and curvature. The tracing protocol composed of four different traces produced the best palate models for the in-vivo procedure. Evidence demonstrated that the TPS procedure as a whole is suitable for modeling the palate surface using a small number of in-vivo tracings.",0,1

"Abstract Individual-level variation is a recurrent issue in variationist sociolinguistics. One current approach recommends addressing this via mixed-effects modeling. This paper shows that a closely related model with fixed effects for individual speakers can be directly estimated using Goldvarb. The consequences of employing different approaches to speaker variation are explored by using different model selection criteria. We conclude by discussing the relation of the statistical model to the assumptions of the research design, pointing out that nonrandom selection of speakers potentially violates the assumptions of models with random effects for speaker, and suggesting that a model with fixed effects for speakers may be a better alternative in these cases.",0,1
"The English modal verb will has always presented problems for descriptive classification within the modal categories traditionally divided between epistemic and non-epistemic. On the one hand, its role as a marker of futurity does not help to distinguish it from many deontic meanings of obligation or necessity; while on the other, its future meanings have often been associated with epistemic senses. Historically, it seems to present anomalies in the form of ‘omnitemporal’ meanings appearing as early as Old English times. The present paper offers a two-fold solution to categorisation problems, suggesting a broad classification of core modal meanings which is related to presupposed speaker knowledge, and within which will may be easily accommodated. An investigation into early uses of will with third-person subjects in selected Old English texts further reveals a majority of uses associated with generic or non-specific subjects and suggests that such omnitemporal uses, rather than those expressing specific intentions of the subject, may have played an important role in the grammaticalisation of predictive functions.",0,1
"We suggest that disability is metaphorically represented in people’s minds as heaviness. In three studies we demonstrate the existence of a mental association between physical weight (light vs. heavy) and disability (non-disabled vs. disabled) as well as its bi-directional causal effects (from weight to disability and from disability to weight). In Study 1 (N = 250), participants exhibited the hypothesized association between the dimensions on both a direct and an indirect measure. Study 2 (N = 191) demonstrated that perceived weight affects the perceived severity of a disability, with the weight of a clipboard held by participants affecting perceptions of a target person’s stutter or limp. Study 3 (N = 103) testified to the reverse effect: participants who heard a monologue by someone with a pronounced (as opposed to mild) stutter perceived the clipboard they were holding as heavier and estimated its weight in grams as higher. Our findings may suggest that experiences of weight affect both estimates of the prevalence of disabilities in others and in the self as well as level of identification with the disabled. Theoretical implications are discussed as well.",0,1
"Advance to an Ideal: Fight to Raise the Standard of Communication between Deaf and Hearing People, by Stewart Simpson (Edinburgh: Scottish Workshop Publications, 2007, 253 pp., £13.50). Paperback, ISBN 9-781873-577455. George Montgomery THIS BOOK GIVES an account of events concerning the formation and development of the Council for the Advancement of Communication with Deaf People in the United Kingdom, which established the sign language interpreters' register the system of Deaf examiners and also promulgated regular standards of qualification in British Sign Language (BSL). At first blush, the blow-by-blow account of the administrative details of fund-raising, advocacy, and organization of yet another Deaf charity would not promise a gripping read to anyone other than the worthy archivist intent on preserving the dry facts for posterity. This first impression would be misleading. As the chapters titled Fighting to Survive and The Road to Recovery suggest, this is a moving personal account that draws the reader into the true story by its realism rather than by artificial literary skills and stratagems. Unlike the United States, which had established a register of ASL interpreters that was widely accepted, the United Kingdom had a network of social workers for Deaf people (SWDs) who practiced interpretation as one of their professional skills. From the beginning, some opposition to the idea of a separate register arose from those SWDs who felt their status was threatened and were averse to the prospect of being examined by Deaf examiners. In a very small minority of cases these fears were justified, when some of the first inexperienced examiners used their unaccustomed power to gain revenge on teachers and social workers they resented due to past differences. Much of the early groundwork was done by Willard Madsen of Gallaudet University, who was invited by the British Deaf Association to spend an extended sabbatical working as a consultant to help to establish a register and appropriate examinations. Madsen brought a number of examples of curricula, examinations, and videos, along with his vast expertise and experience. Rapidly adapting to the British Deaf scene, he gave the project a flying start and learned BSL in the process. As every first-year student of social anthropology knows, attempts to transplant systems across cultures can be beset by unforeseen incompatibilities. distinguished Australian social worker and interpreter John Flynn pointed out that Madsen's model needed time and modification to adapt comfortably into the British Deaf environment. When, after World War II, the British Dental Association introduced new scientific professional standards for dentists, the older experienced dentists who had qualified by less exacting apprenticeship methods were allowed to continue to practice, but new dentists were held to the new standards. In time the older generation died out, and today the new university dental education and strictly monitored examinations are demanded of all. …",0,1
"A cherished semantic universal is that determiners are conservative (Barwise & Cooper 1981; Keenan & Stavi 1986). Well-known problem cases are only (if it has determiner uses) and certain uses of proportional determiners like many (Westerståhl 1985). Fortuny (2017), in a retracted contribution to this journal, proposed a new constraint (the Witness Set Constraint) to replace Conservativity. He claimed that his constraint is satisfied by only and the Westerståhl-many, thus correctly allowing the existence of these non-conservative determiners, whilst it is not satisfied by unattested non-conservative determiners (such as allnon). In fact, we show here that only does not satisfy Fortuny’s Witness Set Constraint (nor does Westerståhl-many, which we leave to the readers to convince themselves of). Upon reflection, it turns out that the reason is simple: the Witness Set Constraint is in fact equivalent to Conservativity. There simply cannot be non-conservative determiners that satisfy the Witness Set Constraint. We consider further weakening of the Witness Set Constraint but show that this would allow unattested determiners.",0,1

The narratives gathered here make up a representative sample, including languages from both the United States and Mexico, selected in an effort to represent as many of the eight established subgroupings as possible (fig. 2) and to include narratives that reflect the work of both outsider linguists and community members. This volume presents texts from the languages that are the most threatened (Kawaiisu, Northern Paiute, and Tübatulabal) and others that currently lack first-language speakers (Cupeño and Serrano), as well as from those that are more viable (e.g., Nahuatl).Fig. 1. Distribution of the Uto-Aztecan languages (from Merrill 2013).View Large ImageDownload PowerPointFig. 2. The Uto-Aztecan languages and their subgroups.View Large ImageDownload PowerPointThe study of the history of the Uto-Aztecan language family goes back more than a century to Sapir (1913), considered the first published work to connect the northernmost and southernmost extremes of the family to the same genetic unit. Intensive research has continued unbroken since—a measure of both the complexity of the family and the need for more thorough documentation of the individual languages. Such scholarship has included traditional comparative reconstruction (Miller 1967, 1984; Stubbs 2011), grammatical comparison (Langacker 1977; Haugen 2008), and overviews of the state of the art in Uto-Aztecan study (Lastra de Suárez 1975; Haugen 2013).As suggested by the family tree in Figure 2 (adapted from Merrill 2013:70–71), the family consists of eight main subgroupings (plus the little-known and extinct Tubar) with a primary division between Northern and Southern Uto-Aztecan. The Northern branch remains controversial, however, as to whether it constitutes a true subgroup or is, rather, a set of four parallel subgroups (or something in between), as suggested by lexical correspondence (cf. Miller 1984; Cortina-Borja and Valiñas 1989). In a recent study (Haugen, Everdell, and Kuperman 2020), the authors apply the metric of “relative cognate density” and find, in agreement with Miller (1984), no clear evidence in support of a Northern branch. The internal unity of three Southern subgroups (Tepiman, Corachol, Aztecan) and two Northern ones (Numic, Takic) enjoys relatively wide acceptance, as do Tübatulabal and Hopi as singletons.1 The internal structure of the Taracahitian subgroup is also not entirely set in stone (Dakin 2002; Haugen, Everdell, and Kuperman 2020), and it is notable that Caballero (this volume) does not identify Taracahitian as a subgroup but maintains the independence of Tarahumaran and Cahitan. Between these two groups, we include here Jova, a language that was documented among the Ópatas but is currently extinct (Yetman 2010:71). Further, as pointed out by Dakin (2002 and in personal communication), the maintenance of a General Aztecan grouping may be ripe for refinement into a Western and an Eastern branch, with Pochutec assuming a position within the Western branch. Other groupings have also been proposed (e.g., Numic and Tübatulabal) but are not considered established. Within the Southern Numic branch, Chemehuevi, Southern Paiute, and Ute form a dialect chain sometimes referred to as Colorado River Numic. Figure 2 also provides in bold the primary subgroups and the names of the languages included in this volume.Our hope is that the present collection provides data germane to historical and other issues by shedding light on developments and innovations at the level of grammar and discourse. More important, we hope this modest sample will serve to inspire future collections that include a greater diversity of speech genres to assist with community-centered documentation and revitalization efforts.Prevalent Features of Uto-Aztecan LanguagesUto-Aztecan languages are morpho-syntactically complex, have a fairly dominant verb-final word order (except for Tepehuan and Nahuatl) with varying degrees of pragmatic flexibility, and make use of a nominative-accusative alignment pattern for expressing grammatical relations (although Cupeño demonstrates ergative alignment in some areas of the grammar). Widespread family traits include morphological complexity in the verb, remnant noun-class markers in the form of so-called absolutive suffixes, reduplication processes of various stripes, and an auxiliary complex composed of second position clitics as well as particles and/or affixes marking evidentiality. Strongly suppletive verb forms based upon core participant number, the use and development of “secondary” verbs, and different strategies (including nominalization) to encode subordinate clauses are all salient features of Uto-Aztecan grammar. These characteristics are briefly illustrated in what follows.Morphological complexity in the verb, demonstrated by examples (1) and (2), includes participant agreement, directional marking, a variety of TAM values (often fused with other inflectional features), voice marking, and processes of incorporation. (See Canger 2017 for a thorough discussion of polysynthesis in Tacuapan Nahuatl.)Cupeño (1)Suunvishpemyingiywenivey suunvish–pem–yi–ngiy–weni–ve–y suffer–3pl.sbj–theme–away–past.impfv–realis.sub–obj ‘those who have gone to suffer’ (Hill 2005:417, ex. 21)Tlaxcalan Nahuatl (2)Ōmonēnkamatsotsopōts. o·–mo–ne·n–kama–co~copo·c ant–refl–bad–mouth–emph~have.prickers:pfv ‘His poor mouth was just full of prickers.’ (J. H. Hill, this volume:S176, (39))Noun formants, known to Uto-Aztecanists as “absolutive” suffixes (abbreviated ncm ‘noun class suffix’), are another characteristic property of languages in the family. These appear mainly in citation (noncombining) singular forms of nouns, as in the Tlaxcalan Nahuatl examples below. The bare nominal root (without the suffix) also appears in compounds, in possessor-possessum relations, or with postpositions.Tlaxcalan Nahuatl (3)koyōtlkoyōmeh koyo·–tłkoyo·–meh coyote–ncmcoyote–pl ‘coyote’ ‘coyotes’ (J. H. Hill, this volume:S171, (4), (7))Reduplication is a widespread morpho-phonological process across the Uto-Aztecan family (Haugen 2005, 2008) and marks plurality on nouns (4), intensity on modifiers (5), and iterativity or the distributive aspect on verbs (6). In Southeastern Tepehuan, the reduplication is partial (copying the first syllable) (4), while in Cupeño (5) and Yaqui (6), as well as other Uto-Aztecan languages, there is full reduplication. Some languages in the family demonstrate both types.Southeastern Tepehuan (4)mi akkɨ’n nat jur, am sap mi’ ba daraa gu u’ub gui’ na bhammɨ ka’n … miak–kɨ’nna=tjuramsap med.advriver–withsbrd=3sg.sbj.pfvget.downlocrep mi’ba–daraaguu’~ubgui’na med.advcompl–sit.plartpl~womandistsbrd bhammɨka–’n upstv–3sg.poss ‘when he went down to the river the women (who threw water at him) were sitting there, the ones who’ (García Salido, Arellano Mijarez, and Everdell, this volume:S164, (22)) Cupeño (5)Kanaasta ku’ut aaay’anish pemyawneq, saval xwavixwavi’aw ku’ut pemqal. kaná·stakuʔutayʔani–špəm–yáw–nəqsavá–l basketquotbig–ncm3pl:pst–carry–comegrass–ncm xʷavi~xʷávi–ʔawkuʔutpəm–qál rdp~green–locquot3pl:pst–stay ‘They say they brought a great big basket, they sat on the green grass.’ (J.

In many languages these combine to form an auxiliary complex (Steele 1979). Sentence-second enclitics are phonologically bound to an initial constituent, such as a full noun phrase, pronoun (7), demonstrative, or particle (8).Cupeño (7)“Emqwep ne’ey nitatushni.” əm=qʷə=pnəʔə–yni–tátušni 2pl.pro=pot=2:erg1sg.pro–obj1sg.obj–fool:tr:pot ‘ “You all might fool me.” ’ (J.

The auxiliary complex may even appear formed solely by means of a string of clitics, as in (9).O’odham (9)attspki at=t=s=p=ki mod=tns=quot=mod=evid ‘I guess they say we must have …’ (Jane Hill, pc)The second position auxiliary complex consists of a combination of person indices and various aspectual, modal, and evidential markers.In a cross-family survey, Thornes (2018) finds support for the reconstruction of a three-way system of evidentiality for Uto-Aztecan that includes the encoding of reported, inferred, and unmarked direct evidence for the family (10)–(11).Choguita Rarámuri(10)iˈkíɾa ɾáːm pa ˈɛ́t͡ʃi … t͡ʃaˈβɔ́t͡ʃì β̞a iˈkí–laru–ˈwá=mipaˈét͡ʃit͡ʃaˈbôt͡ʃiba happen–repsay–mid=demecldemmestizoecl ‘It is said that’s what happened with that mestizo’ (Caballero, Fuentes Holguin, and Fuentes Loya, this volume:S154 (20))Serrano (11)Punuktχ nɨmɨy. pu–nuk=tχnɨmɨ–y 3sg–alone=infr:3sgwalk–ind ‘She must have walked around by herself.’ (K. C. Hill, this volume:S86, (25))The article builds upon earlier studies by Munro (1978) and McLaughlin (1984) that explore a cycle of development and the renewal of reportative affixes or particles originating as speech act verbs. Willett (1988) provides a cross-linguistic survey of the development of such systems more generally.Southeastern Tepehuan is exceptionally rich in such markers, having no fewer than five evidential contrasts (García Salido 2014b)—two reportatives (one for known (12) and another for previously unknown information (13)), an inferential (14), a marked, direct eyewitness form (15), and a sensory evidential (16), in addition to a marker of mirativity.Southeastern Tepehuan (12)Ja–ma–mitba’sakgudespesanami’ 3pl.obj–give–3pl.sbj:pfvseqrepartpantrysbrddir jai’ch–ka–t exist–stv–ipfv ‘They gave them the pantries that were there.’ (García Salido 2014b:102, ex. 49b)(13)siete sap up ba’ ba tɨnɨ’da’ am bhai’dhɨr gu mɨmɨi’ñkalh, sietesapupba’ba–tɨnɨ’–da’–am sevenrepitseqcompl–dance–appl–3pl.sbj bhai’–dhɨrgumɨ~mɨi’ñkalh towards.here–fromartpl~Taxicaringa ‘They were dancing for seven days, those in Taxicaringa.’ (García Salido, Arellano Mijarez, and Everdell, this volume:S161, (1))(14)Xi–ñ–uba’n–am–jibak imp–1sg.obj–disgust–3pl.sbj–dcinfr ‘It is true, they disgust me.’ (García Salido 2014b:103, ex. 50b)(15)Dhudhi’gukumpalhi–’ñna=tya’ eviddemartgodfather–inlsbrd=3sg.sbj:pfvdir jugi’ñgubu~pui–’ñ finishartpl~eye–inl ‘It is the compadre whose eyes they ate.’ (García Salido 2014b:105, ex. 51e) (16)bhai’ pai’ pui’ tɨkia’ am uxcha’m tɇ’kub bottotaji bhai’ bhai’pai’pui’tɨkia’–amux–cha’mtə’kub towards.herewheresensput–3pl.sbjstick–onup botto–ta–jibhai’ bed–vrblz–dctowards.here ‘they put him up there, on a bed made of sticks there’ (García Salido, Arellano Mijarez, and Everdell, this volume:S166, (35))Also characteristic of Uto-Aztecan, sets of so-called suppletive verb forms are found that are sensitive to the number of core participants (“subject” for intransitive verbs and “object” for transitives). Most suppletive verbs have singular versus plural forms, as with Hiaki ‘die’ and ‘kill’ (Table 1).Table 1. Suppletion of “Die” and “Kill” in Hiaki DIEKILLSingularmuukemeʔaPluralkokosua(Haugen and Everdell 2015)View Table ImageNorthern Paiute and other Numic languages demonstrate three-way suppletion in posture verbs (Table 2).Table 2. Three-Way Suppletion of Northern Paiute Posture Verbs SITSTANDLIESingularkatɨwɨnɨhapiDualyɨgwiwamikwapiPluralaataʔakonopokwa / wakwapi(Thornes 2003:316)View Table ImageThere have been various approaches, both synchronic and diachronic in scope, to this pattern of verb suppletion in Uto-Aztecan and elsewhere (see Mithun and Chafe 1999; Harley, Tubino-Blanco, and Haugen 2009; Haugen and Everdell 2015; and Toosarvandani 2016).A construction type that uses “secondary” verbs (Crapo 1970) is found across the family as well, forming complex predicates. Examples (17) and (18) from Northern Paiute and Southeastern Tepehuan illustrate this phenomenon.Northern Paiute (17)oonotɨwauumɨna–tɨničui–pokwa–ʔyakwi Thenalso3.plrecip–tell.stories–lie:pl–hab ‘And then, too, they would lie around telling stories.’ (Thornes 2011:32)Southeastern Tepehuan(18)sap gu ba muu ji mi’ pui’ xi bo’kat mukxikam, gɇ na gu … sapguba–muujimi’pui’ repartcompl–die:pfvfocmed.advsens xi–bo’–ka–tmuk–xi–kamgə’na=gu’ imp–lay.down–stv–ipfvdie–res–originaffirmsbdr=adv ‘so he died lying there, died there, yes because …’ (García Salido, Arellano Mijarez, and Everdell, this volume:S165, (30))Although the construction in (17) is considered in many Uto-Aztecan language descriptions to be a form of verb-verb compounding, Thornes (2011) argues that it best fits the profile of an asymmetrical serial verb construction (Aikhenvald and Dixon 2006). The complex predicate in Southeastern Tepehuan (18) represents a different stage in the development of the construction, given that each verb carries finite features of its own.In terms of syntax, Uto-Aztecan, like many other languages (and language families) of the Americas, makes widespread use of clausal nominalization for different subordinate clause types. Nominalization is used to form complement, relative, and adverbial clauses. For complements Cupenõ marks the verb with a subordinating irrealis suffix (19), while Serrano shows a subordinator suffix on the dependent verb (20). An example of a subject relative clause is presented in Hiaki (21), while an example of an object relative clause is illustrated in Northern Paiute (22). Lastly, an adverbial clause is shown for Kawaiisu (23).Complement clause, Cupeño (19)mu=ju’utpem–yaxpe–meqa–pi and=rep3pl–say3sg–kill–sub.irr ‘and it is said they said for him to kill it’ (Hill 2005:420, ex. 29)Complement clause, Serrano (20)Kʷɨn ra:kʷɨniaʔn moʴč yaŋk qaykʷɨn amaʔ wi:ʔwɨn akʷeikċi. kʷɨnra:kʷɨ–niaʔnmoʴčyaŋkqay=kʷɨn quot:3sg>3sgeatintr–causagainbutneg=quot:3sg>3sg wi:ʔwɨna–kʷe–ik–ċi want3sg–eattr–irr.sbrd–acc ‘She fed him again, but he didn’t want to eat it.’ (K. C. Hill, this volume:S90, (53)) Subject relative clause, Hiaki(21)Hunuu’u intoko Kuka teame Hunuu’u=intokoKukatea–me that.one=andKukaname–sbj.rel ‘That one, who was named Kuka,’ (Leyva et al., this volume:S127, (8))Object relative clause, Northern Paiute(22)yau chaisi e naniana nabo; ya–učaisiɨ=na–nia–nana–bo here–focthenyour=mid–call–ptcpmid–write ‘I see your name here written.’ (Lewis and Thornes, this volume:S24, (11))Adverbial clause, Kawaiisu(23)Neezhigai karüpün iva’n. neezh–igaikarü–p=üniva’n girl–whenabide–pfv=1sg:sbjhere ‘When I was a girl I stayed here.’ (Grant and Ahlers, this volume:S30, (16))Chapters in Comrie and Estrada-Fernández (2012) cover the details of many Uto-Aztecan languages, and additional work on the role and development of nominalization in the family can be found in Chamoreau and Estrada-Fernández (2016).An exception to this pattern is Southeastern Tepehuan (García Salido 2014b, 2020). Example (24) shows a clause subordinated by means of the particle na, which bears second-position clitics. Example (25) shows two headless relative clauses that are marked by the particles in bold. This feature could represent a sign of its long-term, and likely intensive, contact with neighboring non-Uto-Aztecan (and non-nominalizing) languages through grammatical borrowing.Complement clause, Southeastern Tepehuan(24)sap ba’ pui chɨ’nda am gui’, nam bhai’ ba jim sapba’puichɨ’nda–amgui’na=m repseqsenssay–3pl.sbjdistsbrd=3pl.sbj bhai’ba–jim towards.herecompl–go:prs ‘and they told him that they will come (to the mitote)’ (García Salido, Arellano Mijarez, and Everdell, this volume:S162, (11))Headless relative clause, Southeastern Tepehuan(25)palhɨp sap ba’n ya’ni ja’p pai’ nat jɨ’x bha toi’ nat jɨ’x ai palhɨpsapba’nya’–nija’ppai’ littlerepwetthere–precptcwhere na=t–jɨ’xbha–toi’ sbrd=3sg.sbj:pfv–how.manytowards.here–throw na=t–jɨ’xai sbrd=3sg.sbj:pfv–how.manyarrive:pfv ‘He was a little bit wet there, where they threw water at him, where water got him’ (García Salido, Arellano Mijarez, and Everdell, this volume:S163, (19))Both conservative features and innovative changes resulting from contact with non-Uto-Aztecan languages demonstrate interesting patterns of language change and grammaticalization. By providing a wider context for such patterns, the analysis of narrative texts such as those provided here are meant to support further studies in comparative discourse properties and their diachronic sources.Presentation of the textsThis volume includes the contributions of ten Uto-Aztecan languages, one text for each language, with the exception of Northern Paiute and Tübatulabal, for which there are two. We also include two texts from a language that belongs to the Cahitan branch (Hiaki/Yaqui), located just on the border between the United States and Mexico. The reason for including Hiaki and Yaqui is that the former is primarily restricted to ceremonial use or conversations between tribal elders in Southern Arizona, while the second is more vital in the Sonoran communities. Thus it provides a clear example of the social differences that occur within the same language and that affect its use.The narratives included here exhibit a distribution and selection of languages from all major subgroups of Uto-Aztecan with the exception of Corachol and Hopi, providing a legacy of material for future exploration. We present the texts geographically, from north to south, beginning with Northern Paiute, with just a few hundred speakers, and ending with Tlaxcalan Nahuatl, one variety of a language with more than a million speakers. Each narrative is introduced by the contributors, who provide basic information regarding the status of the language, the speakers of the text, and the context of the recording event, as well as any features of the narrative of particular interest.Orthographic conventions are different for each language and are established based on different criteria; therefore each chapter lays down their practical orthographic conventions before the text is presented.These twelve texts are introduced in four-tier format. In the first tier, the intonation unit (phonemic or orthographic) is found. The second tier provides the breakdown into separate morphemes. An equal sign (=) marks a clitic boundary, while an en-dash (–) separates affixes. The third tier provides a literal translation for each word and bound morpheme; the abbreviations for this tier are listed at the end of the volume. Lastly, the fourth tier gives a free translation into English. The Yaqui and Raramuri texts also provide a free translation into Spanish for the reasons expressed in their respective introductions.For systematization purposes throughout the book, we follow these conventions: (a) long pauses are indicated in the first line of the example by three dots; (b) short pauses are indicated in the first line of the example by a comma; (c) elided sounds are indicated in parentheses in the first line of the text and are restored in the analysis; (d) a false start is enclosed in the first line of the text by angle brackets <speech>, and it is not glossed; (e) fragments of songs are indicated by using ♪♪ at the beginning and at the ending of the first line; (f) loanwords are indicated in the first line of the example in italics; and (g) stage directions such as gestures in the first line of the text are indicated by square brackets.DedicationThe contributors to this volume would like to acknowledge the inspiration, the mentorship, and the tremendous contributions of our dear friend and colleague Jane Hill, who passed away on November 2, 2018. As befits her influence on Uto-Aztecan studies, Jane contributed two stories, one from each of the Northern and Southern branches of the family. For all that she accomplished and all whom she inspired, with grace and great humor, we would like to show our gratitude to her by dedicating this volume to her memory.Notes1 We consider a singleton to be a language that is not otherwise part of a subgroup at some level.

"In this article, I explore the narratives and experiences of four Latinx mothers and fathers, Alma, Rose, Valente and Samuel, who participated with their adolescent daughters (grades nine-10), Blanca, Elizabeth, Rocky and Reyna in Somos Escritores/We are Writers writing workshops. Somos Escritores was a family engagement space, created with and for Latinx mothers and fathers and their adolescent daughters, that invited families to draw, write and share stories from their lived experiences. Workshops were designed with and for Latinx parents and their adolescent daughters to open space for the intergenerational exchange of stories and experiences within a political context that continuously and increasingly works to silence and control their voices and experience. Drawing upon written narratives, interview transcripts and ethnographic field notes, I provide insights into the ways that these parents are raising their daughters to be “chicas fuertes/strong girls.” Through the sharing of consejos, stories, and experiences --their “pedagogies of the home,” (Delgado Bernal, 2001), these parents provide their daughters with strategies and tools to navigate their daily lives, including their personal, social and academic worlds, while ensuring that they stay connected to their familial, cultural and linguistic roots.",0,1
"The scarcity of research on speech perception among multilingual speakers precludes a full understanding of phonological acquisition in the third language (L3). In this controlled case study, we investigate L3 phonological acquisition in the perceptual domain and test the predictions of Perceptual Assimilation Model- L2 (Best & Tyler, 2007) adopted for multilingual learners. We employed an AX discrimination task, testing categorical discrimination of Polish sibilants, and a cross-linguistic similarity task, testing perceptual distance between Polish, English and German vowels. We examined L3 Polish perception in 10 multilinguals (aged 14) with L1 German and L2 English who differed in terms of language status (heritage vs. non-heritage). Their perception tasks performance was analysed for accuracy and reaction time. The cross-linguistic similarity task demonstrated that multilinguals assimilate some L3 sounds to both L1 and L2 categories, with a preference for the latter. In the majority of cases multilinguals make a distinction between similar L1, L2 and L3 sounds. The AX results showed that even beginner L3 learners distinguish highly similar L3 sibilant pairs. Our data suggests that the PAM-L2 model could also be extended to L3 acquisition; however, beginner L3 learners seem more likely to perceive subtle acoustic differences in novel phonological contrasts.",0,1
"Traditional analyses of French recognize three nasal consonant phonemes /m n ɲ/ appearing in the labial, apical and palatal orders respectively. What is interesting about this situation is that while French contains labial and apical oral stops /p b t d / corresponding to /m/ and /n/, there are no palatal occlusives linked to /ɲ/. Conversely, in the velar order where we find /k/ and /g/, there is no velar nasal representative. Thus, in a widely used presentation, Malmberg notes that ‘Le français n'a pas de phonème /ɲ/. Un son [ɲ] peut exceptionnellement apparaître comme variante par suite d'une assimilation de /g/ en contact avec une nasal: une longue minute [yn1Ʒɲminyt]. Dans les emprunts anglais comme smoking, parking, camping , il semble qu'un nombre croissant de Français prononcent une nasale vélaire /ɲ/.’ (1969: 106). One can also cite the words of Fouché (1959: XIX), who notes that, ‘Il faut aussi ajouter à cette liste [de consonnes françaises] le son [ɲ] (= n vélaire) de la terminaison anglaise - ing qui a pénétré par voie d'emprunt dans le système consonantique français; cf. meeting, parking, smoking , etc.’ Neither author, however, explores the question in any detail.",0,1
"Logistics : its origin, conceptual evolution and meaning in contemporary usage
This article traces the origin of the word logistics, outlines its conceptual evolution, and explains its meaning in contemporary usage. The contextual development of the concept is traced from its origin in Greek, along with its successive adoption in Late Latin, French and Dutch, up to its contemporary usage in Afrikaans. The establishment of the French logistique as military concept during the Napoleonic wars, and its later extension to commercial usage subsequent to the Second World War are described. The development since then of the meaning of the concept in a commercial context is detailed. Contemporary descriptions of logistics relating to its meaning in a commercial sense and in common parlance are discussed. Thereafter the article offers a contemporary definition of logistics in a commercial context. Finally it is indicated how effective business logistics adds value.

"AbstractThe Trans-Atlantic and Pacific Project (TAPP) is a telecollaboration network linking European university classes with classes in the US and beyond for nearly 20 years. Such collaborations have enabled students to participate in realistic projects, fostering transversal and language skills – including English as a lingua franca – which are highlighted in university policies at European, country/region and institutional levels. In turn, telecollaboration can support Internationalisation at Home, along with virtual mobility objectives, increasingly prominent in European higher education.Considering the grassroots nature of TAPP, whose instructors design their own partnerships and assignments, this contribution examines TAPP projects in light of language policies from a dual bottom-up/top-down perspective. Thus, considering the importance of language policies of several European countries involved in TAPP (Belgium, France, Italy, Spain), this paper analyses how TAPP teaching-learning practices align with such policies in terms of multilingualism and interculturality.Attention is paid to students’ roles – subject-matter experts, linguists/translators, project managers, usability experts – and their native languages. Emphasis is placed on how students relate to English from their various perspectives as native speakers, second-language speakers, language experts or language learners. Lessons derived from the analysis of such practices can inform policy makers as they make provisions for Internationalisation at Home, mainly in Europe, while also introducing comparisons between European and US perspectives.RésuméTrans-Atlantic and Pacific Project (TAPP) est un projet en collaboration à distance, mené entre diverses universités européennes et américaines depuis presque 20 ans. Ces collaborations ont amené les étudiants à participer à des projets favorisant les compétences linguistiques et transverses, dont l’anglais comme lingua franca (ELF), ces dernières étant mises en lumière dans certaines politiques universitaires au niveau de l’Europe, des pays, des régions, des institutions. D’autre part, ce type de collaborations vient satisfaire à des objectifs d’internationalisation et de mobilité virtuelle, toujours plus valorisés dans l’enseignement supérieur en Europe.Si l’on considère le processus constitutif de TAPP, au cours duquel les enseignants créent leurs propres matériaux pédagogiques et docimologiques, cet article analyse ce projet à la lumière des politiques linguistiques, à la fois dans une perspective bottom-up, mais aussi dans une dimension top-down. En partant de l’importance des politiques linguistiques dans le Supérieur dans plusieurs pays impliqués dans TAPP (Belgique, France, Italie et Espagne), cet article analyse la façon dont ces pratiques pédagogiques sont en phase avec ces politiques, dans les domaines du multilinguisme et de l’interculturel.TAPP s’intéresse tout particulièrement aux rôles des étudiants, des experts métiers, des traducteurs, des responsables de projets, des experts en utilisabilité et des langues utilisées. Nous nous sommes concentrés sur la place de l’anglais au sein de ces collaborations: locuteurs natifs, locuteurs utilisant une seconde langue, experts linguistiques ou apprenants. Les enseignements tirés de ces analyses peuvent être utiles aux prescripteurs concernant “l’Internationalisation chez soi”, surtout au sein de l’Union européenne et nous avons introduit des comparaisons entre l’Union européenne et les États-Unis.",0,1
"Abstract The imperial boat-racing event, known as ‘Racing for the Target’ in the Northern Song capital Kaifeng in spring, was created at the close of the reunification campaign when the focus of the state policy was shifted towards internal cohesion. It signified the power and great order of the newly reunited empire. Through the re-interpretation of the event and its emulation at the local level, an imperial cultural language of boat racing was forged. It also allowed the imperial symbolism of ‘Racing for the Target’ to be communicated through the fabric of society. This paper treats performance and pageantry as a field of meaning production. It uses ‘Racing for the Target’ as an example to examine how symbols can be manipulated in the display of power. It argues that through the performance of ‘Racing for the Target’ the Song state with its political apparatus sought to establish its dominance over the symbolism of boat racing. Other versions of interpretation therefore were compelled to be confined within the imperial context.",0,1
"Letters to Language Frederick J. Newmeyer and Colin Phillips Language accepts letters from readers that briefly and succinctly respond to or comment upon either material published previously in the journal or issues deemed of importance to the field. The editor reserves the right to edit letters as needed. Brief replies from relevant parties are included as warranted. Grammar and usage: A response to Gregory R. Guy August 14, 2006 To the Editor: In two recent contributions to Language—Grammar is grammar and usage is usage’,79.4.682–707, 2003 (GGUU) and ‘A reply to the critiques of “Grammar is grammar and usage is usage” ’, 81.1.229–36, 2005 (RCG)—I critiqued stochastic approaches to grammar, namely those in which grammatical constructs are linked directly to probabilities of occurrence in discourse. My arguments included the point that probabilistic generalizations derived from a sociologically and dialectally heterogeneous group of speakers are irrelevant to determining the grammatical competence of any particular member of that group; that as far as syntactic variation is concerned, since variants typically differ in meaning, the probabilities are likely to be more a function of the meaning to be conveyed than a characteristic inherent to the structure itself; and that the multiplicity of genres confounds the simplistic treatment that one finds in much of the literature defending stochastic approaches to grammar. Gregory R. Guy (G), in a letter to Language (81.3.561–63, 2005), has taken issue with my position. Distressingly, from my point of view, he sees my remarks as exhibiting ignorance of the fact that ‘speakers manifestly are sensitive to frequencies and manipulate them systematically’ (G, 561). But in fact, I recognized explicitly that ‘language users and hence their grammars are sensitive to frequency’ (GGUU, 697). I did stress, however, that ‘from the fact that Y is sensitive to X, it does not follow that X is part of the same system that characterizes Y’. Far from rejecting the essentials of the variationist project, I described it in a supplement to the journal The Sciences (‘Benchmarks: 35 years of linguistics’, 36.6.13, 1996) as a major breakthrough of modern linguistics, where I commented that ‘[t] he work of William Labov of the University of Pennsylvania and his colleagues has demonstrated that much of the everyday variability in speech is systematic, showing both social and linguistic regularities’. I don’t deny that ‘variability in language is highly structured’ (G, 561), nor that ‘individuals are grammatically similar as a function of social proximity’ (G, 562). But I do deny that the grammar of any particular individual can be derived from probabilities gleaned from corpora full of utterances where social proximity among speakers is absent. Surprisingly to me, given his other remarks, G agrees, writing that ‘a corpus drawn from the New York Times does not offer a very close approximation to the linguistic input and personal grammars of Carl Pollard or Ivan Sag’ (G, 562). But that’s just my point. The corpora used in most stochastic approaches to grammar (though perhaps not in the more careful sociolinguistically informed ones) conflate utterances from speakers from a wide variety of regions and social classes. G provides one example to rebut my ‘hoary argument that perhaps syntax is different from phonology’ (G, 562), namely that in Brazilian Portuguese (BP) subject-verb agreement is disfavored (though not categorically banned) with postposed subjects. While G does not provide a literature reference to track down, my immediate reaction was that he put forward a particularly problematic case in support of his position. In the first place, G ignored my point about syntactic variation and meaning. Since in BP, as in all Romance languages, preverbal and postverbal subjects differ dramatically in their discourse properties (Anthony J. Naro and Sebastião J. Votre, ‘Discourse motivations for linguistic regularities: Verb/subject order in spoken Brazilian Portuguese’, Probus 11.1.75–100, 1999), a complicating factor that G’s approach fails to deal with enters the picture. Second, if the analysis referred to by G is correct, in which postverbal subjects originate in object position, then we have an independent explanation for the agreement facts. Verb-object agreement is crosslinguistically significantly less common than...",0,1

"In this article, I argue for the existence of semantic properties that cut across and unify distinct types of modality. These properties exist in the form of asymmetric relations holding between modal sentences—entailments that can involve modalities with distinct ordering sources. For example, John will go entails John can go and is entailed by John must go, with more than one ordering source involved in these entailments. To account for these modal entailments, I arrange the relevant ordering sources along a hierarchy. I posit that lower ranked ordering sources cannot reorder worlds and can at best resolve ties left by higher ranked ordering sources. In the defence of the proposal, I appeal to a disparity principle, by which the prejacent in a modal statement is not allowed to hold in all or in no worlds in the modal base. I also dispute the notion that an empty ordering source plays a role in modal interpretations.",0,1
"Abstract We examine how the language of online reviews has changed over the past 20 years. The corpora we use for this analysis consist of online reviews, each of which is paired with a numerical rating. This allows us to control for the perceived sentiment of a review when examining its linguistic features. Our findings show that reviews have become less comprehensive, and more polarized and intense. We further analyzed two subgroups to understand these trends: (1) reviews labeled “helpful” and (2) reviews posted by persistent users. These trends also exist for helpful reviews (albeit in a weaker form), suggesting that the nature of reviews perceived as helpful is also changing. A similar pattern can be observed in reviews by persistent users, suggesting that these trends are not simply associated with new users but represent changes in overall user behavior. Additional analysis of Booking.com reviews indicates that these trends may reflect the increasing use of mobile devices, whose interface encourages briefer reviews. Lastly, we discuss the implications for readers, writers, and online reviewing platforms.",0,1
"Many languages encode phi-features via overt morphology, yet children’s use of this morphology in comprehension tasks varies widely. Here, we use a picture-selection task to test comprehension of Spanish verbal agreement and clitics, comparing performance across and within each paradigm to examine the effect of two factors: (i) phonological salience, and (ii) semantic (under)specification. Both paradigms encode the same person and number features, but clitics may be easier to comprehend than agreement because they carry more phonological material. Within each paradigm, first- and second-person morphology may be easier to comprehend than third-person because they carry an explicit person feature. We find limited support for phonological salience and stronger support for semantic (under)specification. However, we also find evidence for a third factor affecting interpretation of third-person morphology: discourse prominence. Both adults and children permit third-person agreement and clitics to refer to the speaker and/or addressee if they have been mentioned in the immediately preceding context.",0,1
"ResumenA partir de un estudio de la teoría levinasiana de la metáfora, se formula en este artículo la noción de quiasmo metafórico con el objetivo de articular, en un espacio de exposición semántica dinámica, un movimiento de más allá (au-delà) —desplazamiento hacia otros significados— y una direcciónde más acá (en-deçà) —conservación de los rasgos sensoriales, imaginativos y afectivos asociados a las palabras. Esta herramienta filológica conduce a la siguiente tesis: la exposición ética a la vulnerabilidad del rostro surge metafóricamente en las huellas sensibles e histórico-culturales del extranjero, la viuda, el huérfano y el judío. La simultaneidad de lo Dicho estético(atención al detalle de estilo) y del Decir ético (respuesta al llamado del Otro) da lugar a una fenomenología de la vulnerabilidad social: las huellas de los rostros de los pobres convocan a compartir el pan y la palabra a partir de la manera como su fragilidad concreta habita y cuestiona los relatos abiertos de la literatura y las imágenes inacabadas del arte.Palabras clave: metáfora – ética y estética – fenomenología de la vulnerabilidad – Emmanuel Levinas AbstractIn this article, Emmanuel Levinas’ theory of metaphor derives into the notion of “metaphorical chiasm”. This idea articulates, in a semantically dynamical manner, a double-way movement: one that goes “beyond”(au-delà) —the displacement to other meanings— and another that stays “here” (en-deça) —the retention of the sensuous, imaginative and affectivetraits of words. This philological tool is functional to the following thesis: the ethical exposition to the other’s vulnerability (and, specifically, to theother’s face) expresses itself metaphorically in the sensuous, the historical and the cultural traces of the stranger, the widow, the orphan and the Jew. The simultaneity of the esthetical “Said” (the attention to stylistic detail) and the ethical “Saying” (the attention to the other’s calling) gives way to a Phenomenology of social vulnerability: the traces of the faces of the poor call for the sharing of bread and word that derives from the way in which their concrete frailty hosts and questions the open narratives of Literature and the unfinished images of Art.Keywords: metaphor – ethics and aesthetics – Phenomenology of vulnerability– Emmanuel Levinas.",0,1

"Bakhtin's concept of heteroglossia was ambiguous on a central point: whether the styles or socio-ideological languages that constituted it were creations of novelistic discourse itself or were already established in everyday speech and incorporated into the novel. The sociolinguistic and anthropological literature on indexicality has greatly enriched our understanding of heteroglossia, but, it, too, leaves this question up in the air. After a brief review of writing on indexicality, we show that the idea of ‘n + 1’, higher-order, indexicality, first mooted by Silverstein, intersects with debates in analytic philosophy of language about the relative roles of inference and semiosis in linguistic understanding. Higher-order indexicality, crucially, depends upon inferential processes, ranging from simple analogy to complex argument, and this has consequences for where indexical values are established.",0,1

"Much has been written about the Spanish marker ‘se’ and its functions, the conclusions suggest that aside from its function as a reflexive pronoun it is a pragmatic marker not following a homogeneous structure (Azpiazu Torres, 2005, Aarón and Torres Cacoullos, 2006; Maldonado, 1999). We propose that additional information on the function of ‘se’ is provided by the hand gestures co-occurring with ‘se’. This paper adds to the existing body of knowledge by taking a multimodal approach to investigate the uses of ‘se’ by two groups of speakers, one Spanish and one Mexican, by adding gestures to the linguistic analysis.Our results confirmed the various functions highlighted by linguistic analysis and point to the importance of including the gesture when interpreting the various meanings of ‘se’. In particular we observed that in verbs like ‘comer’ or ‘tragar’ (to eat, to swallow), ‘se + ingest’ is the preferred form, the gesture marking the subject, not the object. This is significant as studies of ‘se’ indicate that its use is to provide a telic aspect to the action indicating the whole object has been ingested (Sánchez López, 2002), yet the gesture highlights the subject. With intransitive verbs, the gesture stresses or adds information related to the path or manner of the action, suggesting that one of its main function is to energize the action, as suggested by Maldonado (1999). Our results indicated that Mexicans are more likely to use the marker ‘se’ but there were no differences in terms of functionality.",0,1
"Reviewed by: Focus on French as a Foreign Language: Multidisciplinary Approaches Katherine Rehner Dewaele, J.M. (Ed.) (2005). Focus on French as a Foreign Language: Multidisciplinary Approaches. Toronto: Multilingual Matters. Pp. 242, $59.95. J.M. Dewaele's edited collection Focus on French as a Foreign Language: Multidisciplinary Approaches is the first volume of its kind written in English focusing on the acquisition and production of French interlanguage. It is a 10-chapter volume of articles focused on beginning to advanced learners from a variety of linguistic backgrounds. Chapter 1, by Watorek and Perdue, 'Psycholinguistic Studies on the Acquisition of French as a Second Language: The ""Learner Variety"" Approach,' provides a summary of and commentary on studies of adult language acquisition undertaken within a learner variety approach. The authors are interested in the idiosyncratic productions characterizing the early stages of acquisition and the grammatical yet inappropriate productions of the advanced stages. Chapter 2, 'Discourse Structuring in Advanced L2 French: The Relative Clause' by Hancock and Kirchmeyer, uses relative clauses to illustrate clause combining. The authors suggest that the use of subordinators as a measure of syntactic complexity should be evaluated at both the micro- and macro-syntactic levels. They describe several relative structures that characterize the discourse structuring of advanced learners and help identify advanced stages of acquisition. [End Page 482] Chapter 3, by Schlyter, 'Adverbs and Functional Categories in L1 and L2 Acquisition of French,' argues that children acquiring two languages simultaneously begin by using adverbs on the lower end of the adverb hierarchy and move to higher-level adverbs only later on, a pattern supporting a Structure Building Model. Conversely, the authors demonstrate, adult L2 learners use higher-level adverbs from the earliest stages of acquisition, a pattern supporting the Strong Continuity Hypothesis. Chapter 4, 'The Emergence and Use of the plus-que-parfait in Advanced French Interlanguage' by Howard, provides an analysis of the acquisition and use by advanced learners of the plus-que-parfait to express the meaning of reverse order. In addition to his investigation of this form–function relation, the author outlines a theoretical framework for the analysis of this form in Reichenbachian terms. Chapter 5, by Myles, 'The Emergence of Morpho-syntactic Structure in French L2,' examines the emergence of morpho-syntactic structure in the French of classroom learners. The author considers the structure of early utterances and the role of the verb phrase for such learners and discusses the importance of her findings in relation to the role of Universal Grammar in the process of L2 acquisition. Chapter 6, 'Syntactic and Semantic Issues in the Acquisition of Negation in French' by Véronique, undertakes, first, to describe the development of negation in Moroccan Arabic learner varieties of French compared to other learner varieties of French and, second, to examine the syntactic and semantic factors accounting for the developmental sequences documented. Chapter 7, by Prodeau, 'Gender and Number in French L2: Can We Find Out More about the Constraints on Production in L2?' seeks to find out more about knowledge and procedures related to number and gender via a series of tasks and via real-time production and contrasts the findings from various situations of production (constrained to free verbal tasks). Chapter 8, 'The Development of Gender Attribution and Gender Agreement in French: A Comparison of Bilingual First and Second Language Learners' by Granfeldt, adopts a longitudinal, cross-learner perspective in exploring the development of gender in the grammars of adult L2 learners and of children acquiring two L1s. The goal is to determine whether there are qualitative differences in how gender is acquired by the two groups and how the development proceeds in the two cases. Chapter 9, by Regan, 'From Speech Community Back to Classroom: What Variation Analysis Can Tell Us about the Role of Context in the [End Page 483] Acquisition of French as a Foreign Language,' analyzes the acquisition by L2 learners of native-speaker patterns of variation and of sociolinguistically sensitive variables. The study highlights the developmental stages of an acquisition process that includes a year abroad in a target-language community in addition to classroom learning.

"This article addresses how F rench teenagers of North A frican (primarily A lgerian) descent transform the A rabic speech act H ashek through their nontraditional and innovative uses. In F rench language interactions that involved adversarial teasing or public criticism of a peer, A rab F rench teenagers used the politeness formula H ashek as a self‐corrective to simultaneously facilitate and mitigate such irreverent behavior. In addition, teenagers used H ashek as an other‐corrective in order to publicly mark peers as inappropriate or rude. Thus both usages of the term (self‐ and other‐corrective) aid teenagers in achieving impolite, nondeferential speech. In using H ashek to accomplish impolite speech, F rench‐speaking teenagers of North A frican background transform this traditional A rabic linguistic practice to suit the face‐needs of their adolescent peer group in F rance, while remaining in conversation with North A frican interactional rituals and cultural norms.",0,1
"Abstract The study focused on verifying the relationship between the ability to meet parental goals, parental difficulty, the child's representation in the parent's mind, and aggressive directiveness. The project refers to Tomaszewski’s theory of action as well as to Gurycka's theory of parental mistakes, in which the inability to achieve parental goals is treated as the main cause of experienced parental difficulties. The analyses were performed on data collected from 158 mothers of preschool children. The analyses were performed using structural equations as well as associative algorithms and artificial intelligence algorithms: cluster analysis and artificial neural networks. The structural model revealed strong relations between variables. The cluster analysis revealed three characteristic profiles in the maternal population that are distinguished by the level of analyzed variables. The artificial neural network revealed that, on the basis of the variables included in the model, the parents’ results in aggressive directiveness can be predicted.",0,1

"Introduction: Working memory is assumed to play a major part in hearing and communication in everyday listening situations. Our working memory stores information, but in suboptimal listening conditions, interfering stimuli can lead to information only being partially stored, or even missed. Research suggests that a high working memory capacity (WMC) might not just be a result of a large store, but in addition good inhibitory control can facilitate working memory, and therefore aid in situations where focus on a target stimulus while ignoring distractors is needed.Objective: The aim of the present study was to investigate how individual WMC, cognitive inhibition, and lexical decision relate to listening to speech under adverse conditions in two separate groups: 46 young normally hearing (NH) and 40 elderly hearing-impaired (HI) individuals.Results: It showed that lexical access was of little importance for young NH individuals in a speech-in-noise test, but that high lexical decision-making was associated with lower signal-to-noise ratios for the elderly HI individuals. The results also showed that WMC was of importance for word recognition in a speech-in-noise test for elderly participants, when the 80% word recognition criterion was targeted, but not for the young NH individuals. Finally, results suggest that cognitive inhibition, as measured with the Hayling task, was important for young NH individuals when listening conditions are suboptimal.Conclusion: In conclusion, hearing loss is a strong contributing factor to declines in the ability to recognize speech in noise, and in order to assess speech-recognition-in-noise performance, individual differences in WMC and cognitive inhibition should be taken into consideration. Future research should include various age groups, with and without hearing loss, as well as measures of WMC, cognitive inhibition, and lexical access when assessing the ability to listen to speech under adverse conditions.",0,1

"Drawing extends the capacity to communicate, since it allows individuals to use graphic objects and symbols to articulate complex ideas not easily communicated using words alone. Similarly, theorists argue that metaphors are commonly used to communicate complex and abstract concepts. Though, the interpretation of visual metaphors has been studied in relation to film and advertising, referencing common metaphors used in language, research has yet to examine how individuals construct their own visual metaphors and whether existing language-based metaphors are used, as a basis. Studying the underlying structure of drawings, using organizing frameworks and mapping systems, provides insight into how individuals use metaphors to communicate and the interdependent relationships between text and image.This study applies conceptual metaphor theory and frame semantics to identify and map visual metaphors in drawings of Knowledge. Three research questions guided the study: How are visual metaphors [of Knowledge] inferred in participant drawings using existing language-based metaphors?; Can language-based metaphor ontologies and semantic systems be used for interpreting visual metaphors?; and How are inferences found in language-based metaphors evident in the design of visual metaphors?Data were collected as part of the study: What does knowledge look like?, where participants (N = 404) were asked to draw what they thought Knowledge looks like to them, and explain why they drew what they did in writing. Five example cases are presented in the results: 1) the Illuminated Light Bulb, 2) the Electric Brain, 3) the Brain as a Container for Knowledge, 4) Knowledge (Ideas) as Food, and 5) the Open Mind. The findings present three notable conclusions: the combination of multiple metaphors within a single drawing; the use of a language-based metaphor ontology (i.e., Master Metaphor List) and frame semantics as analytic tools to examine visual metaphors; and the potential for additional language-based metaphor categories to emerge.",0,1
"This paper argues for a new perspective on the study of language endangerment dynamics where diversity serves not only as a yardstick for assessing equality, but represents the very basis of equality. To this end, we propose a unified framework accounting for the ecology of languages and language diversity loss. Different ways of economically organizing communities result in power differentials. In cases of contact between them, the language ecologies of the less powerful communities are disrupted through language shift and attrition processes. While these processes have taken place in all competitive language ecologies across time and space, two major waves of language diversity loss can be attested. The first wave began 11,000 years ago following the Neolithic revolution when agrarian societies expanded into the territories of hunter-gatherer communities. The second wave was initiated by the French Revolution when dynastic realms transformed into modern states. The promotion of linguistic nationalism and social mobility in societies imagined to be linguistically homogenous undermined the value and utility of minority languages. Two basic possibilities exist for maintaining linguistic diversity: one is limiting contact to dominating communities; another is finding ways of regulating inter-community relations by mechanisms that do not rely on power alone. Ongoing processes in glocalizing societies suggest that a combination of both options may become a viable way to halt language diversity loss.",0,1
"This article reports on an interdisciplinary, collaborative project grounded in linguistic theory on impersonalisation and visual communication theory on wordless visual narratives. The aims of this practice-based research project are to develop an alternative to existing methods of studying impersonalisation strategies through interdisciplinary collaboration and to test its usefulness for identifying not only the range of possible linguistic strategies of impersonalisation, but also the preferred strategies for specific impersonal uses. The group of 18 collaborators consisted of two linguists, one graphic design lecturer and 15 final-year graphic design students. The students were responsible for designing visual prompts for the questionnaire that 1) should not limit the possible linguistic answers, 2) must be able to accommodate any impersonalisation strategy, 3) should not contain any limiting linguistic clues, and 4) had to comply with the criteria on the basis of which the 12 impersonal uses are distinguished from one another. The questionnaire was piloted in two phases. After each phase, the students adjusted and refined their visual prompts. A validation phase indicated that the finalised questionnaire fulfils its functions, since at least 16 different impersonalisation strategies can be distinguished, and preferable strategies for each impersonal use can be identified.",0,1
"This study examines the attitudes of 102 Nigerians towards six varieties of English in terms of status and solidarity: Southern British, Scottish, General American, Acrolectal Nigerian, Non-acrolectal Nigerian, and Ivorian. Using the verbal guise technique, attitudinal evaluations were obtained via an online questionnaire with a six-point semantic differential scale and eight traits. A speaker identification task was also included to examine dialectal awareness. Results indicate that the British, American, and Acrolectal Nigerian varieties received more positive evaluations in terms of status, while greater solidarity was expressed towards the American and both Nigerian varieties. An examination of participants’ responses reveals that accent familiarity and the speaker’s degree of accentedness enhance the listener’s ability to make fine-grained distinctions. These findings are discussed in relation to the acceptability of an endonormative variety in Nigeria.",0,1
"Ma these interroge les modalites discursives du « changement dans la continuite », qui fait la specificite des relations franco-africaines. J'analyse la recomposition des rhetoriques coloniales en rhetoriques du developpement a travers les phenomenes de reformulation des formes linguistiques, qui, a la fois, rendent compte de cette « relation de dominance particuliere » et participent a la construire. A partir des observatoires prealables que sont les discours des chercheurs en sciences humaines et sociales, l'analyse des archives de memoire lexicographiques et encyclopediques resulte en un etat des savoirs sur les notions de colonisation, de progres civilisateur et de developpement. Le cheminement au sein des differentes theories du discours, puis de la categorisation linguistique permet de poser des hypotheses de configurations discursives et de leur transformation au fil des evenements historiques. Hypotheses qui sont soumises a l'epreuve d'un corpus d'etude compose d'un ensemble d'une centaine de textes du \siecle{XVIII}~siecle a nos jours : textes du progres des Lumieres, de l'economie, de l'anthropologie et textes sur la colonisation et le developpement de l'Afrique autour du Mali.

Les differents marqueurs, qui composent les notions, les types et les alterites permettent in fine d'approcher le fonctionnement discursif de l'ideologie qui structure la relation de dominance.",0,1
"This study investigates the acquisition of the argument structure of dative verbs in L3 English. The learners are L1 Moroccan Arabic–L2 French adults advanced in L3 English. The study considers whether the L3 learners in a formal foreign language instruction context can develop nativelike sensitivity to the semantic and morphological constraints on the distribution of double objects and prepositional phrases in dative constructions. The results of a grammaticality judgment and correction task reveal overgeneralization effects on non-alternating verbs in advanced L3 ultimate attainment. At the same time, the L3 learners show nativelike sensitivity to instances of subtle semantics, but not morphology, associated with dative constructions. The analysis of individual results provides empirical evidence supporting the claim that syntax–semantics and syntax–morphology interface properties are acquirable even if they are language-specific and previously inactive in the L1/L2. Thus, in ultimate attainment, L3 acquisition is another instance of L2 acquisition.",0,1
"AbstractThe history of the French prénom ‘given name’ laws of 1803 and 1993 are recounted. The terms of the Consulate's 1803 law and how authorities have interpreted and applied them throughout the last two centuries are presented. The law was originally intended to prevent using last names as first names. However, in the twentieth century this same law was used to protect children from potentially harmful names. The naming law of 1993 appears to put into effect what had already become the practice. Sources of information include legal documents, interviews, newspapers and naming books for parents.",0,1
"Using long-term average spectrum (LTAS) analysis of fluent speech, the effects of speaking in noise and of speaking with differently filtered auditory feedback as well as of voluntarily changing vocal intensity is analyzed in nine male adult singers and non-singers. Three values in the LTAS are analyzed: the level of the main peak near 500 Hz, of a secondary peak near 2000 Hz and at the average F0. The level at 500 Hz was highly correlated with the equivalent sound level, with the average F0, and with the level of the peak near 2000 Hz. The singers were found to produce a higher sound level than the non-singers under all conditions, and their voices contained stronger high-frequency components. Also, unlike the non-singers they reduced vocal intensity when reading without added noise with enhanced high-frequency components in the auditory feedback. The LTAS effects of noise and of auditory feedback filtering was found to be similar to those of the changes of vocal intensity according to instruction for both singers and non-singers. When the high-frequency components of the auditory feedback was enhanced during reading in noise, both subject groups reduced vocal intensity.",0,1
"The study investigates the reflections on tempo-aspectual morphology in Italian expressed by undergraduate multilingual learners with previous knowledge of Swedish and a Romance language (N = 22). The reflections of the participants, who were divided into four groups depending on a combination of proficiency in their background Romance language and in Italian, were analysed using a qualitative content analysis. From the analysis categories and subcategories emerged, and their occurrences served to display group tendencies. Four categories (explicit rules, intuition, other languages and uncertainty/unknown), and seven subcategories were found and their occurrence was differently distributed across groups. Further, the reflections of the learners became more sophisticated as proficiency in Italian increased. In fact, the reflections progressively incorporated different layers of information connected to explicit knowledge about tenses: temporal, aspectual and, finally, lexical, that is, the inherent semantics of the predicates. Finally, while the reflections of low-proficiency learners referred to different L2s (e.g. English and French), high-proficiency learners made comparisons with Swedish more consistently, regardless of their proficiency level in the Romance language. These results are discussed in the light of research on second/additional language learning of aspectual distinctions in Romance languages.",0,1
"WHAT has been the effect of the impact of American English on modern French? In view of the many contacts between Americans and Frenchmen in recent years, it would be surprising indeed if evidence of American influence were not discernible. A convenient opportunity to arrive at some notion of that influence is afforded in a novel of the Second World War, Emigres de luxe, by Maurice Dekobra, published by Brentano in 1941. Since the action of most of the novel takes place in and around New York, and since most of the characters are American, the author uses a great many English words and a great many Americanisms. His only restraint in this regard, we may assume, would be his sense of the ability of his French readers to understand these outlandish terms. Because Dekobra is a skillful writer, with many successful novels behind him, may we not also assume that his judgment as to what Americanisms his readers would understand can be trusted? A justifiable conclusion, then, would be that the English words and the Americanisms used by Dekobra have, to some degree at least, become a part of the French language. Emigris de luxe is the story of an Austrian movie actress who escapes from the concentration camp where she has been interned by the Germans and appeals for shelter at the chateau of the Duc de Brancourt. The much-married duke himself takes an interest in her, hides her from the German agents, marries her, and after the fall of the Third Republic, brings her to America. The S.S. Toledo, with its 225 refugees, docks in New York on page 61 of this 404-page novel, and after that, the action is wholly in New York and at Ivy Lodge, the palatial mansion near Tarrytown, New York, where live the two unmarried sisters of the duke's first wife, together with June, eighteen-year-old daughter of the duke by this earlier marriage. Lest the reader unfamiliar with Dekobra conclude that this is another 'sentimental novel for chambermaids,' I hasten to add that it is highly sophisticated and even gay as the French know how to be gay in the midst of a good deal of misery. His revenues cut off as a result of the German invasion of France, the duke is faced with the problem of earning a living in the New World, a problem which he solves with no great expenditure of blood, sweat, and tears by becoming first a master of ceremonies in a night club and later a popular lecturer before women's clubs, on the subject of how to use that charm, or, according to the billing: 'Your Heart Is My",0,1
"Los modelos computacionales han jugado un rol importante en el descubrimiento y entendimiento de las complejidades psicologicas de la comprension textual. Esto ha sido por tres razones principales. En primer lugar, el proceso de transformar teorias de comprension de textos, descritas verbalmente (teorias conceptuales), en modelos computacionales de comprension promueve el desarrollo y evolucion de las teorias conceptuales, mostrando donde los modelos concuerdan con informacion empirica y donde no lo hacen. En segundo lugar, los modelos computacionales pueden ser aplicados a informacion de comportamientos con el fin de comprender mejor y evaluar constructos explicativos alternativos, especialmente en casos donde los patrones de comportamiento no resultan como se esperaba a priori. En tales casos, los investigadores aportan explicaciones post-hoc, muchas de las cuales resultan bastante razonables. Los modelos computacionales pueden asi proveer un modo de evaluar tales explicaciones. Por ultimo, y parcialmente, como resultado de los primeros dos beneficios, los modelos computacionales promueven la comunicacion entre investigadores dentro y a traves de diversas areas de investigacion. Estos argumentos se ilustran por medio de ejemplos especificos de modelos computacionales",0,1
"Scholars of second language (L2) learning and teaching are increasingly exploring students' use of the L2 outside the classroom setting, in recognition of the powerful effect this self-directed study can have on language learning. Within sign language studies, students have long been exhorted to immerse themselves in the Deaf community. However, until now we have lacked an evidence base of the degree to which they do this (or other out-of-class study), how effective they find it, or whether/how engagement changes as proficiency develops. This study explores these issues by considering responses from 157 students enrolled in four different levels of Auslan (Australian Sign Language) units at the same tertiary institution. Findings indicate that students at all levels have low engagement with structured revision but make good use of media resources and face-to-face interactions, and that uptake of these increase in relative frequency to their developing capabilities and personal networks. Innovative students also integrate Auslan study into everyday situations and interests.",0,1
"Abstract Concepts are our tools for thinking. They enable us to engage in explicit reasoning about things in the world. Like physical tools, they can be more or less good, given the ways we use them—more or less dependable for categorisation, learning, induction, action‐planning, and so on. Do concept users appreciate, explicitly or implicitly, that concepts vary in dependability? Do they feel that some concepts are in some way defective? If so, we metacognise our concepts. This article offers a preliminary taxonomy of different forms of metacognition directed at concepts and suggests that concept‐metacognition impacts on several different cognitive processes.",0,1
"Acquisitionists generally assume a relation between code-mixing in young bilingual and trilingual children and language dominance. In our cross-sectional study we investigated the possible relation between code-mixing and language dominance in 122 children raised in Spain or Germany. They were bilingual, trilingual or multilingual, the latter acquiring more than three languages. The definition of language dominance is grounded on Birdsong’s (2014. Dominance in bilingualism: Foundations of measurement, with insights from the study of handedness. In C. Silva-Corvalán, & J. Treffers-Daller (Eds.), Language Dominance in Bilinguals: Issues of operationalization and measurement (pp. 85–105). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press) distinction between domains and dimensions. The main result of our study is that code-mixing is rare in a monolingual setting which means that bilingual, trilingual and multilingual children are able to behave monolingually. Domain-specific language dominance can explain the relatively high mixing rate in the Catalan tests but concerning the dimensions of language dominance no relation was found between the children’s code-mixing and language (un)balance. A separate analysis of intra- and intersentential mixing reveals that intersentential mixing is determined by the typological proximity between the child's languages. All instances of intrasentential code-mixing, were insertional.",0,1
"New Trends in ASL Variation Documentation Corrine Occhino (bio), Jami N. Fisher (bio), Joseph C. Hill (bio), Julie A. Hochgesang (bio), Emily Shaw (bio), and Meredith Tamminga (bio) Sign Language Studies is introducing a new section titled ""Reports on Ongoing Research."" These short research briefs are intended to provide a format for researchers to report on projects for which research is ongoing but for which a timely research brief would be of interest to the Sign Language Studies (SLS) community. Research reports include relevant background information, including the impetus for the work, methodologies, past progress, state of ongoing work, dissemination efforts, and future plans. [End Page 350] In this first research report, we are pleased to provide an overview of the progress made on three ongoing sociolinguistic documentation projects focused on American Sign Language (ASL). These projects are being carried out by three separate research teams based at the University of Pennsylvania, Gallaudet University, and the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT)–National Technical Institute for the Deaf (NTID). The structure of the report will describe each project in turn, concluding with a description of future directions for a new sociolinguistic documentation project involving an exciting collaboration of the three research teams. Sociolinguistic Variation in ASL Recognition of sociolinguistic variation in ASL has been an important part of the documentation and description efforts since the beginning of linguistic research on the language (Lucas and Bayley 2001). As ASL is the language of diverse communities of Deaf (and hearing) people across the United States and Canada, far from being homogeneous, ASL comprises several unique ASL varieties (e.g., Black ASL [McCaskill, Lucas, Bayley, and Hill 2011; Hill 2017] or Philadelphia ASL [Fisher, Tamminga, and Hochgesang 2018]). While sociolinguists have focused considerable time and effort on documenting ASL variations, limited resources in the form of time, money, equipment, technology, and personnel have constrained documentation efforts. As such, our knowledge of ASL variations varies greatly from state to state, community to community, context to context both in terms of breadth and depth of knowledge. Furthermore, with a few exceptions (Hill 2012, Bayley et al. 2017), our understanding of ASL communities' beliefs and attitudes about nonprestige or minoritized varieties of ASL is still also largely lacking. Here, we report on three current efforts to increase the breadth and depth of documentation of ASL varieties across diverse groups of signers, namely, the Philadelphia Signs Project (Fisher, Tamminga, and Hochgesang), the Gallaudet University Documentation of ASL project (GUDA) (Hochgesang and Shaw), and Documenting Individual Signs in ASL (DIVA) (Hill and Occhino). Each project focuses on solutions to different limitations of past documentation efforts while sharing similar goals, that is, to increase representation of underrepresented [End Page 351] varieties in the documentation of ASL, to raise awareness of varieties used in these communities, and to create sustainable and accessible language repositories for future generations of ASL signers to appreciate the signs of a diverse language community. Philadelphia Signs Project (Fisher, Tamminga, and Hochgesang) Philadelphia Signs Project: Background The Philadelphia Signs Project is a collaborative effort between the Philadelphia Deaf community and researchers at the University of Pennsylvania and Gallaudet University. It centers on the collection, annotation, and analysis of video-recorded conversations of regular users of ASL, who were raised in and acquired ASL in the Philadelphia area. The impetus for this project came from various members of the Philadelphia Deaf community, who wished to document the variety of their signing, used mostly by the older signers in the Philadelphia area. As a lifelong member of the Philadelphia Deaf community and faculty in the University of Pennsylvania's Department of Linguistics, Dr. Jami Fisher realized there was an opportunity to meet the community's demand for documentation and preservation of its variety.1 Using her extensive connections within the Philadelphia Deaf community, Fisher was able to recruit both interviewers and participants to launch this extensive project. She turned to her Penn linguistics faculty colleague Dr. Meredith Tamminga to consult on socio linguistic methods; Tamminga subsequently joined the project, bringing expertise in sociolinguistic theory plus familiarity with research on language variation and change in Philadelphia English.2 Rounding out the team, Dr. Julie Hochgesang (Gallaudet University...",0,1
"Verbs of negative meaning are as commonly used in French as negative adverbs, and have always been during the different periods of this language models underlying this possibility of substitution appear more clearly using the theory of support verbs and predicative nouns (ex: manquer de courage is almost synonym of ne pas avoir de courage). These lexical resources have been extensively used in french over the XVIIth century. This phenomenon affects mainly constrained forms of writing such as verses and in particular dramatic alexandrine. It is linked to the large number of sentences with support verbs and rests on preferences and prohibitions. We suggest that this process eventually offers an immediately available solution, because of its obvious conveniency. Although it cannot be said to have affected the linguistic system, its influence still exists nowadays.",0,1
"This article presents an overview of the last two decades of research in synchronic Slavic theoretical phonology and the fields it interacts with, such as phonetics, morphology, and syntax. The overview is arranged around the properties of Slavic languages that prominently figure in the recent discussion of theoretical phonology. It concentrates on the specific phenomena in Slavic, such as vowel reduction, vowel/zero alternations, stress and pitch accent, vowel coalescence, voicing assimilation, word-final devoicing, and consonant clusters and syllabification, and on how these phenomena are relevant to phonological theory and Slavic linguistics.",0,1
"Recent work in cognitive neuropsychiatry explains the Capgras and Cotard delusions as alternative explanations of unusual qualitative states caused by dam-age to an affective component of the face recognition system. The difference between the delusions results from differences in attributional style. Cotard patients typically exhibit a style of internal attribution associated with depression, while Capgras patients exhibit the external attribution style more typical of paranoia. Thus the Cotard patient attributes her condition to drastic changes in herself and the Capgras patient attributes the same changes to alterations in the environment. I suggest three modifications to this explanation. Firstly, the nature of the affective deficit in Cotard cases may be more global than in Capgras cases, resulting from the diffuse effects of the neurochemical substrate of depression. Secondly, this explanation gives us additional insight into the content of the delusion. It is unsurprising that persons whose global affective responses were suppressed would explain their lack of response by saying that they had no bodily existence. Finally I suggest that in Cotard cases the delusion is produced by a reasoning deficit, rather than attributional style.",0,1

"There is vast potential for digital screens to support early bilingualism. For the most part, however, young children require human mediation with what is generated by screens in order for language and pre-literacy learning to occur. What does that mediation look like when multimodal elements are designed to support children’s language and culture learning? This study examines instructional interactions around Digital Fairytales, multimedia language, and culture material designed for teaching and learning the Russian language and culture. Bilingual classroom integrations of Digital Fairytales were recorded and teachers interviewed. Analyses point to specific mediation tactics that teachers employed that capitalized on the producerly pleasures inherent in shared digital screen experiences. Through these analyses, we see the potential of digital screens to support mediated bilingual learning.",0,1
"The scope of the paper is to analyse Namibian mainstream primary teachers’ practices in the multilingual context they work in. As teachers have a central role in implementing language policies, their practices either support or impede learning as well as learners’ multilingual identities. Multilingual practices entailing rich scaffolding and translanguaging strategies are supposed to be beneficial for content and language learning and the learners’ identity development. The methodological approach adopted in this study is ethnographic, and the theoretical framework is linguistically responsive teaching and multilingual education. The data consist of teacher interviews and focus group discussions, a questionnaire and classroom observations. The analysis method is qualitative content analysis. The data were collected in two Namibian government primary schools in the beginning of the 2020 school year. The analysis shows that translanguaging strategies such as peer translation or explaining concepts in home languages are used, but rarely as pre-planned pedagogical strategies. Scaffolding is provided mostly through visual aids. It may be concluded that the translanguaging strategies already in use should be encouraged further, and multilingual pedagogies should be included in both pre-service and in-service teacher education.",0,1
"Le but de cet article est d'analyser le rôle des métonymies dans les publicités britanniques sur le téléphone portable. L'hypothèse selon laquelle les réseaux de radiotéléphonie fonctionneraient de façon métonymique plutôt que métaphorique, bien que le mot réseau soit issu d'une métaphore textile, est appliquée à trois publicités britanniques sur le téléphone portable, datant de juin 1998. Avec la firme Orange, la métonymie apparaît comme constitutive de l'expérience téléphonique. La filiale de British Telecom spécialisée dans les téléphones mobiles, Cellnet, a choisi de jouer sur les tarifs, et d'énumérer toutes les économies que sa formule « First for Families » rend possible. La communication est alors métonymiquement représentée par son coût. L'entreprise Vodafone a clairement mis en valeur un glissement métonymique de la connexion physique au lien social dans sa publicité pour les conversations au tarif de deux pence par minute en faisant se succéder trois scènes riches, sans y inclure l'ombre d'un téléphone. On voit donc comment les publicités pour le téléphone portable fondent leur argumentaire sur différents niveaux de métonymies, du réseau de télécommunications aux réseaux sociaux, en passant par des réseaux économiques.",0,1

The topics we will discuss in the remainder are: counterfactuals, causality, partiality, compositionality of conditionals, and context dependence.",0,1
"Cette recherche a pour objet d'etudier et de comparer la signification du mot air (apparence, maniere d'etre) aux xviie et xxe siecles, et d'examiner la relation que ce mot entretient, dans chaque epoque concernee, avec vair qu'on respire. Le travail s'articule en deux grandes parties, la premiere etant consacree a air-fluide gazeux et air-apparence, a partir des dictionnaires modernes, et la seconde a air-element et air-maniere d'etre, dans la correspondance de madame de sevigne. La methodologie est a la fois philologique (on part d'exemples, de citations, de textes) et linguistique, avec une exploration systematique du contexte, qui va de l'approche distributionnelle au contexte large, et du contexte linguistique au savoir partage qu'il contient. L'etude menee met en lumiere d'importantes differences dans le fonctionnement du mot air d'une epoque a l'autre. Au xviie siecle, le mot air-maniere d'etre appartient avant tout au domaine social et implique une evaluation normative. Il denote a la fois la maniere d'etre collective et les differents aspects du sujet social (maniere de vivre, maniere d'etre en societe, maniere de parler, maniere de se mouvoir, maniere de se tenir, maniere de se presenter). La notion de groupe, dominante dans la signification de ce mot, favorise la jonction d'air-maniere d'etre avec air-element. On passe aisement, en effet, par transfert metaphorique, de l'air d'un lieu a l'air d'un milieu social. Il n'en est pas de meme au xxe siecle, ou le mot air denote avant tout l'apparence expressive et privilegie l'observation du sujet psychologique. On perd alors, avec la notion de groupe, le maillon de sens indispensable au traitement polysemique, et la disjonction homonymique d'air-fluide gazeux et d'airfluide gazeux et d'air-apparence s'impose. Cette etude ouvre la voie a une reflexion plus vaste sur l'evolution des mentalites du xviie au xxe siecle, en meme temps qu'elle montre l'interet, au plan linguistique, d'une approche dynamique et continue du sens lexical.",0,1
"Many homosexual men in Indonesia speak what they call bahasa gay ‘ gay language’, a linguistic phenomenon based upon bahasa Indonesia (Indonesian), Indonesia's national language. Bahasa gay involves derivational processes including unique suffixes and word substitutions, and a pragmatics oriented around community rather than secrecy. Although mainstream knowledge of gay men's existence is limited, bahasa gay is increasingly being appropriated by Indonesian popular culture. By examining bahasa gay in terms of state power and register, the article asks how this form of speaking might contribute to better understanding how gay subjectivity is bound up with conceptions of national belonging. Gay Indonesians might seem to epitomize difference; they seem to lie radically outside the norms of Indonesian societies. Within gay communities and in popular culture, however, bahasa gay appears as a register of belonging, not one of hierarchy or distance.",0,1

"490 LANGUAGE, VOLUME 58, NUMBER 2 (1982) is a detailed report of the construction, development , and validation of an EFL placement test for German university students. The DELTA is a norm-referenced mix of discrete point and integrative measures, which is shown to be very efficient in predicting later success in learning English, as well as being useful in languageacquisition research. 'Measurement or global assessment of oral foreign language proficiency?', by W. Knibbeler , compares the global and analytic measurement of the French of 108 Dutch adult learners . K attempts to ascertain—via the creation of indices of correctness, fluency, and lexical variety—whether speech acts can or should be described by counting words and errors. The results show a high correlation between the global ratings of proficiency given by trained judges and the ratings derived from quantitative analysis oftranscription ofrecorded speech, the major difference being that global assessment is much less time-consuming. The last three articles are more directly concerned with the quantitative analysis of learner errors. T. Slama-Cazacu and T. Dutescu-Caliban present 'The first hierarchical system of errors (HSE) in the acquisition of English by native speakers ofRomanian' , a statistical study from the Romanian-English Contrastive Project of Bucharest. A total of 1183 errors produced by 252 speakers are analysed hierarchically by grammatical structure, taking into account frequency of occurrence and communicative importance. The authors scrutinize the different tasks involved, learner strategies such as 'disguising', the effect of time on learning and errors, and other variables; they conclude that the classical contrastive hypothesis is not valid, since most errors result not from the base language, but rather from influences in the material already acquired in the target language. They outline routes for further contrastive analysis and error therapy. U. O. H. Jung compares the written English of dyslexic and non-dyslexic German school children in 'Dyslexia and the foreign-language teacher'. J first reviews the literature on dyslexia , and then examines the performance of388 subjects on a dictation-cloze test. The results indicate that the classic definition of dyslexia, as characterized by reversal or inversion ofgraphemes in reading and writing, needs to be adjusted (at least in second-language learning situations ), since such a phenomenon represents only 3% of the performance errors; indeed, the 'normal' children tended to reverse and invert letters more often than the dyslexic children. R. Grotjahn closes the volume with a critical assessment of the methodological issues inherent in the quantification of articulatory difficulties —'Zur Quantifizierung der Schwierigkeit des Sprechbewegungsablaufs'. His specific focus is the quantitative definition of the problems which learners encounter in the articulation of German consonant sequences. This volume, which shows substantial awareness of the state of language research in the United States, seems significant for several reasons , not the least of which is the presentation ofthe meticulous research ofEuropean scholars who are not well-known in America. Particularly because ofits critical perspective and dedication to empirical substantiation of learning and teaching theory, the volume will be of considerable value to researchers in language acquisition and proficiency—whether linguists, psychologists, or psychometricians.

Pp. xi, 444. $45.00. In 1966, John Marshall and Freda Newcombe published a case study concerning 'selective dysphasic impairment', with specific emphasis on 'the linguistic aspect of paralexia'. When their patient was asked to read aloud single, unrelated words, he showed an interesting error pattern; instead of saying the given words, he gave semantically-related substitutions, e.g. 'uncle-nephew', 'liberty-freedom', 'little-short' etc. In a subsequent paper (1973) Marshall & Newcombe suggested that these substitution errors indicated the impairment of the spelling -sound route to the lexicon. Within half a decade, the dysphasic profile indicating nonfluent speech, fairly good object-naming, reduced short-term memory span, and predominantly semantic substitutions in oral reading became known as 'deep dyslexia' or 'phonemic dyslexia' (T. Shallice & E. Warrington, 1975). In 1978 a symposium was held at Jesus College, Cambridge, to discuss the 22 cases (16 English and 6 Japanese) reported in the neuropsychological literature.

"REVIEW ARTICLE On the adequacy of the Competition Model Edward Gibson Carnegie Mellon University* The crosslinguistic study of sentence processing. Edited by Brian MacWhinney and Elizabeth Bates. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1989. Pp. xviii, 489. Cloth $37.50. 1. Introduction. This book consists of a collection of thirteen papers describing a psycholinguistic model of language acquisition and use—the Competition Model (Bates & MacWhinney 1982, MacWhinney et al. 1984)—along with tests of the model in a number of different languages. The most extensive tests of the model come in the areas of sentence comprehension and firstlanguage acquisition, although evidence is also presented on sentence production , second-language acquisition, and sentence comprehension by speakers with language deficits. The book is intended as a major contribution to the field ofpsycholinguistics in two ways: first, the authors attempt to provide a uniform framework for explaining all manifestations of psycholinguistic effects, ranging from language acquisition to sentence processing to sentence production; and second, they try to test this framework in a variety of languages, something not previously attempted to this degree. It is commendable that MacWhinney & Bates (hereafter M&B) and their colleagues seek to examine numerous languages simultaneously, but the success or failure of their endeavor hinges upon the success or failure of the model upon which it is based. My comments, therefore, will consist primarily of an examination of the underlying model. Under the Competition Model, the language processing system consists of a direct mapping in the form of a connectionist network linking the form of an input sentence (an acoustic or visual signal) to the function óf that form (its meaning in context). In order to determine the function of a given input sentence, according to the model, the listener relies on cues in the input stream that correlate with meanings of the word string. Cues to meaning include such characteristics as word order, semantic plausibility, and morphological agreement among words in a sentence. For example, word order is reported to be the most important cue in the assignment ofmeaning in English, while in Italian, * This article was written during 1991-1992 while the author was at MIT in the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, supported by a postdoctoral fellowship from the McDonnell-Pew Center for Cognitive Neuroscience.

Hence the English input the pencil kicks the cow is most often interpreted with the pencil as actor of the kicking action, but the Italian translation of the same sentence is most often interpreted with the cow as actor. Furthermore, proponents of the Competition Model assume that the same mechanisms are involved in both first-language acquisition and second-language acquisition, as well as in the acquisition of numerous other cognitive skills. In particular, they assume the existence of a back-propagation connectionist network that updates cue strengths according to how well each cue correlates with the appropriate interpretation of an input sentence. Thus a cue which is successful much of the time will receive positive reinforcement, while an unsuccessful cue will be negatively activated. The Competition Model contrasts sharply with nativist theories of first-language acquisition, grammatical competence, and use. Like the Competition Model, the nativist approach assumes that there is much for first-language learners to induce on their own (e.g. the lexicon and inflectional paradigms); but this approach also assumes the existence of a constraint-based Universal Grammar (UG) that the child uses in the acquisition of the target human language (see e.g. Chomsky 1965, 1986, Wexler & Culicover 1980, Pinker 1984, Wexler 1990, and Crain 1991). The arguments in favor of the nativist approach usually rely on the observation that children acquire certain components of language without having adequate evidence for them in the environment. This is known as the 'poverty of the stimulus' argument. For example, while knowing a language involves knowing...",0,1
"The trade unions have a number of challenges to face in the 21st Century. The first and essential challenge is the one of the leading and stimulating of the process of work distribution. This is also a challenge for society as a whole for the 21st Century. After facing this challenge the trade unions will have to adapt themselves to the changes which have taken place in the arrangement of the working class. They will have to readapt their organization and action in order to cover the sectors which have been opposed to trade union force up to now, like the so called Service Sector. Their objective should be the increase of their affiliation. A third handicap the trade unions will have to overcome is the damage of collective bargaining –very related to the currrent economic-politic situation– and of hostility towards trade union activity. They could achieve this through a correct organization and trade union protective action. As a fourth challenge Spanish trade unionism must solve the problem of the little importance of collective bargaining caused by the weakness of federations and the turning to the state instead of turning to the company organizations when negotiating. This constitutes a problem because a weak collective bargaining discourages affiliation. Finally the last problem is that the nationalist trade unions are confined by judicial connection and the practices of the state performers that make Euskal Herria´s trade unions which have even made an accusation against Gernika´s Statute.",0,1

"We compare the use and function of two discourse particles that show many similarities: Canadian English eh and Canadian French hein. Surveys of anglophone students at the University of Toronto and francophone students at Universite´ Laval reveal that these particles have similar discourse functions and that there are many parallels in their patterns of use. However, francophone students report a higher use of hein than do anglophone students of eh. Moreover, francophones have more positive attitudes towards constructions with hein than do their anglophone counterparts with respect to eh. In addition, eh—used both less often and valued less positively—has taken on additional functions as an identity marker: it is used to identify speakers of Canadian English and, in print, to evoke Canadian solidarity. In contrast, hein does not have an identity marking function. We propose that the development of an identity marking function for eh—and the lack of such a function for hein—reflects differences in how linguistic identities are constructed in English and French Canada.",0,1
"This article investigates the syntactic properties of deponents in finite and nonfinite contexts in several Indo-European languages (Vedic Sanskrit, Ancient Greek, Latin, Hittite, Modern Greek) and proposes a novel definition of deponency: deponents are morphologically nonactive verbs with noncanonical agent arguments that are merged below VoiceP. Since VoiceP is spelled out with nonactive morphology in those languages if it does not introduce an external argument itself, the result is a surface mismatch between morphological form and syntactic function. This proposal predicts that only certain nonfinite forms of deponents will surface with the syntax/morphology mismatch, namely, those that include VoiceP. Nominalizations without VoiceP will appear to suspend the voice mismatch. These predictions are shown to be correct with respect to the behavior of deponent participles in the languages under study.",0,1
"In this article, we investigate verbs of motion in discourse, adding a dimension that has not yet been explored in published literature — viz. the variation in representing motion across different registers. We take a functional- registerial approach and profile the representation of motion through space in four registers, which include six ""spatial texts"" (i.e. texts where motion through space is central) and bring out the kinds of motion that are characteristic of each register. We profile the preferences of representing motion in verbs in qualitative and quantitative terms. Our findings reveal that the lexical choices for representing motion in each register resonate with the ""field"" of discourse. The findings reported in this study are significant for text-typology involving the description of motion and are, therefore, of theoretical interest. Most previous discourse-based studies, usually informed by the analysis of narratives, suggest that (in Talmy's well-known classification) satellite-framed languages in general pay more attention to manner and verb-framed languages to direction. We propose that the inclusion of a registerial dimension in the study of motion in discourse further deepens our understanding of satellite- and verb-framed languages' attention to manner and direction of motion.",0,1
"This article deals with the relation of linguistic knowledge and interactional expectations in spoken professional discourse, more specifically, academic expert presentations in Japanese and German, L1 and L2. It argues that crucial pragmatic differences between L1 Japanese and L1 German corpus data concern linguistic means which process interactional expectations on the part of the hearer in language specific manners. Because of differing discourse procedures in Japanese and German, as hearers, German and Japanese L1 speakers hold differing expectations toward what a speaker is doing and how s/he is going about it. The significance of these ‘interactional expectations’ is in that they facilitate processes of understanding on the part of the hearer (H) by enabling H to anticipate illocutionary and / or propositional relations between utterances in discourse. After a short discussion of the concept of ‘‘interactional expectations’’ in section 1, the data and research context are described section 2. Drawing on corpus data, some of the characteristics and distinct language specific constructions in L1 Japanese academic expert presentations are outlined and contrasted with L1 German in section 3; in section 4 a comparison of an L1 Japanese example with L2 German by an L1 Japanese speaker reveals ‘‘pragmatic transfer’’ based on differences in the pragmatic patterns of L1 Japanese and L1 German discourses, specifically discussed with regard to aspects of social deixis/politeness. In section 5 supplementary evidence of a general difference between (inter-)actional and propositional organization in Japanese and German academic expert presentations is discussed with regard to fillers / speaker’s exotheses and prefatory actions, and in section 6 modals and connectives as linguistic means organizing discourse structures. In section 7, a conclusion is drawn focusing on the need to reflect on interactional expectations in multilingual settings, in order to enable L1 interactants to link non-L1 like linguistic realizations to actually shared discourse purposes in multlilingual constellations.",0,1
"Research is scarce about the lexical processes undertaken by thousands of L2 learners worldwide who already command one or more languages. Some aspects involved in lexical organisation and production, such as clustering and switching, have been traditionally approached through manual methods, which depend on subjective judgments of semantic relatedness between words. The present study seeks to provide a more objective exploration of EFL lexical production and organisation strategies of two rather similar groups of 12th grade learners of EFL as L2 and L3 via a distributional semantic analysis of semantic fluency. In addition to common measures of vocabulary performance, such as number of words produced, a series of lexical organisation and production strategies along with global and local semantic relatedness metrics will be examined. No differences were found about word frequency. While the L3 group used more word classes and cognates, and produced more idiosyncratic responses, the L2 group excelled in most semantic relatedness variables. These results might be due to the presence of the third language in the L3 group, which might be partly interacting with the other background languages. Evidence on these aspects may inform the development of precise language learning strategies adapted to the learner’s linguistic profile.",0,1

"This experimental study explores the effects of workshops designed to increase directly the knowledge of Latinx parents, and indirectly, their children’s vocabulary knowledge. Thirty-two Latinx mothers were randomly assigned to either attend six workshops in Spanish (n = 17), or to a wait-list control group (n = 15). Workshops included carefully designed strategies to scaffold the information based on parent English language proficiency, early childhood knowledge, and technology skills. Results indicate that mothers who attended the workshops significantly increased their early childhood knowledge, and children whose mothers attended the workshops significantly increased their Spanish expressive vocabulary. We did not find significant effects of the workshops on parental technology knowledge and literacy knowledge, although effect sizes were moderate. We discuss our findings in the context of building parental knowledge to increase their role construction and self-efficacy taking their funds of knowledge into account.",0,1
"Abstract This is the second of two articles that survey and assess progress and prospects in the historical linguistics of the Otomanguean language family, which is the most widely distributed and most diverse linguistic lineage of Mesoamerica. While considerable progress has been made in understanding the linguistic and cultural history of Otomanguean, in some ways, it remains the Mesoamerican language family about which we know the least. It consists of eight major subgroups: Mè'phàà‐Subtiaba, Chorotegan, Oto‐Pamean, Chinantec, Mixtecan, Amuzgo, Zapotecan, and Popolocan. While the first article of this series addressed the historical linguistics of the higher levels of the Otomanguean family, this article focuses on the eight major subgroups, especially progress in their reconstruction, internal subgrouping, and areas in need of further research.",0,1
"This paper reports an experiment that investigates interpretive distinctions between two different expressions of generalization in Spanish. In particular, our aim was to find out when the distinction between generic statements (GS) such as Tigers have stripes and universally quantified statements (UQS) such as All tigers have stripes was acquired in Spanish-speaking children of two different age groups (4/5-year-olds and 8/9-year-olds), and then compare these results with those of adults. The starting point of this research was the semantic distinction between GS and UQS in that the former admit exceptions, unlike the latter. On the other hand, several authors have observed a Generic overgeneralization effect (GOG) consisting in allowing for UQS to be felicitous in the face of exceptions, thus proposing that this “error” stems from GS being defaults (simpler, more easily learned and processed). In the current paper we aimed to test the “Generics as Default” (GaD) hypothesis by comparing GS and UQS in three different age ranges. Our data show that, overall, the accuracy of GS is greater than the accuracy of UQS. Moreover, we also confirm a hypothesized interaction between age and NP type (GS vs UQS). Further, we present several data points that are not predicted by the GaD, including an observed decline in the accuracy of GS in the older group of children as well as in adults, and that children fail at rejecting statements that are not considered to be true generalizations.",0,1

"<b>Background and Aim</b> The effects of very early aphasia therapy on recovery are equivocal. This article examines predictors of very early aphasia recovery through statistical modeling. <b>Methods</b> This study involved a secondary analysis of merged data from two randomized, single-blind trials conducted in Australian acute and subacute hospitals. Study 1 (<i>n</i> = 59) compared daily therapy to usual ward care for up to 4 weeks poststroke in patients with moderate to severe aphasia. Study 2 (<i>n</i> = 20) compared daily group therapy to daily individual therapy for 20 1-hour sessions over 5 weeks, in patients with mild to severe aphasia. The primary outcome measure was the Western Aphasia Battery Aphasia Quotient (AQ) at therapy completion. This analysis used regression modeling to examine the effects of age, baseline AQ and baseline modified Rankin Scale (mRS), average therapy amount, therapy intensity, and number of therapy sessions on aphasia recovery. <b>Results</b> Baseline AQ (<i>p</i> = 0.047), average therapy amount (<i>p</i> = 0.030), and baseline mRS (<i>p</i> = 0.043) were significant predictors in the final regression model, which explained 30% (<i>p </i>< 0.001) of variance in aphasia recovery. <b>Conclusion</b> The amount of very early aphasia therapy could significantly affect communication outcomes at 4 to 5 weeks poststroke.

"This paper is a lexicological study of the brand names of newly FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approved drugs which aims at highlighting the new trends observed in drug naming. For our corpus, we used a listing of 320 drugs approved by the FDA for sale in the United States for the years 2012 to 2017. In our study, we showed that the commonly used letters X and Z were giving way to A and O endings so as to attract Romance languages speaking clients. We demonstrated that this trend matched a less recent ploy in food and automotive marketing. We focused on the “Vowel/Consonant+lexeme” matrix that is found almost exclusively in the drug industry because it permits to create a name shorter in writing – an advantage for prescribers. Although the FDA recommended that “unsubstantial beneficial” connotations be banned, we uncovered the presence of promotional affixes as well as hidden emotional contents that are meant to be persuasive.",0,1

"Frequency-domain blind source separation is an effective way to separate the signals from convolutive mixtures. The independence component analysis (ICA) is commonly employed to separate signals in each frequency bin, resulting in the well-known permutation problem. To resolve this problem, we present a low-complexity permutation alignment method based on the inter-frequency dependence of signal power ratio. A bin-wise permutation alignment is first carried out across all the frequency bins by measuring the correlation between the current frequency bin and the previous one, but only the permutation with a high confidence is fixed. The permutation with low confidence is then determined by maximizing the correlation between the current frequency bin and a local centroid, which is calculated from a set of determined frequency bins with high confidence. By so doing, the permutation for most frequency bins is aligned without iterations. Finally, a clustering algorithm with centroids is adopted to achieve the fine global optimization in the fullband with only a few iterations. Experiment results show that the proposed method achieves a comparable performance with the state-of-the-art permutation alignment schemes, but the new method achieves a significant computational saving.",0,1

We present an investigation of the ways in which speakers' subjective perspectives are likely to affect the meaning of gradable adjectives like tall or heavy . We present the results of a study showing that people tend to use themselves as a yardstick when ascribing these adjectives to human figures of varied measurements: subjects' height and weight requirements for applying tall and heavy are found to be positively correlated with their personal measurements. We draw more general lessons regarding the definition of subjectivity and the ways in which a standard of comparison and a significant deviation from that standard are specified.,0,1
"Gibbs and O'Brien (1990) argue that the high degree of consistency in speakers' mental images for common idioms indicates that conceptual metaphors play a vital role in constraining the meaning of such expressions. The experiment reported here, which monitors speakers' reading of the stimuli used by Gibbs and O'Brien, seeks to uncover a phonological correlate of the same phenomenon. It is argued here that the highly constrained nature of the source domains from which metaphorically motivated idioms draw their meanings (evidenced, in the Gibbs and O'Brien study, by the consistency of speakers' mental images) causes words internal to such idioms to be highly predictable. This predictability is associated with words carrying a low semantic load, licensing their phonological reduction. The hypothesis that words internal to idiomatic expressions are reduced in duration is confirmed, and this is taken as further support for Gibbs and O'Briens' findings that metaphors are to at least some extent active in the on-line processing of idioms.",0,1
"682 LANGUAGE, VOLUME 74, NUMBER 3 (1998) evidence, F remarks that it is difficult to assess the stylistic or sociolinguistic values associated with onbin versus non-onbin forms. While he disclaims the need to consider such values in this chapter, it is precisely these values that F appeals to in Ch. 4 when he proposes an explanatory account of onbin sound changes grounded in hearer/speaker-based innovations in interpretation. Here, and throughout the book, F takes his data from the secondary literature and omits any reference to the source texts in which the data actually appear. Ch. 2 provides the theoretical framework for the analysis. F uses the set of acoustically defined distinctive features of Jakobson and Halle, which he terms 'diacritic signs'. The phoneme is a 'structured syntagm' consisting of diacritic signs which are ranked in terms of their conceptual importance. Production of language involves realization rules which consist of implementation rules (including the subtypes variation rules and neutralization rules) and adaptive rules. In the theory of language change adopted from Andersen, change arises through innovations which are either adaptive or evolutive and deductive or abductive. Ch. 3 discusses the phonology of Old Japanese, with focus on tenues, mediae, and nasals, the segments involved in the onbin changes. The status of the koo-otu vocalic distinctions and the role of tonality in the context ofthese changes are also addressed. Ch. 4 interprets the onbin sound changes as phonological abductions based on the reduced realizations of certain forms. The reduced forms, representing familiar variants, were reinterpreted as politeness neutral on the one hand or, on the other, reinterpreted semantically, with the 'familiar' feature ofthe familiar variant assigned as a lexical property of the reduced form. Ch. 5 briefly touches on 'relative signantia' which F views as abductions based on the outcome of the onbin sound changes. Ch. 6 analyzes segmental oppositions in the reduced style of speech in terms of salience of contrast and the potential for segmental innovation in the direction of 'phonemic monophthongization'. Ch. 7 points to sonority as a key factor: the onbin sound changes appear only when a reduced segment is higher in sonority than the following segment. F focuses on the processes of valuation, segmentation, and ranking in the interpretation of reduced variants ofcertain syllables as the post-peak nuclear segments of the preceding syllable. It was this innovative process of syllabification which gave rise to the new type of long syllable in Japanese. F's main contribution through this application of Andersen's framework is to account for the onbin sound changes as a process of 'phonemic monophthongization '. His view ofthe onbin changes thereby contrasts with the interpretation of those changes as the result of segment loss, proponents of which view he cites as Mabuchi, Miller and Okumura (161, note 95). A descriptive view of the onbin sound changes which is similar to F's may be found in Samuel Elmo Martin (1987. The Japanese language through time, 37. New Haven & London: Yale University Press). F's analysis will also contribute to the debate on the extent to which underlying representations must reflect surface phonotactic constraints and the extent to which synchronic derivations are a reflection of diachronic change, as discussed by Timothy J. Vance, (1987. An introduction to Japanese phonology , 194-95. Albany: State University ofNew York Press). [Ann Wehmeyer, University ofFlorida.] Spanish in contact: Issues in bilingualism .

"Compound Case Markers in Australian Languages1 Fritz Schweiger Abstract In several Australian languages, it is possible for nominals to carry more than one inflectional case marker. This can be due to adnominal multiple case marking where two or more cases are assigned to a nominal. This type has been known as ""Suffixaufnahme."" The recent book Double Case (Plank 1995) gives a good survey of this topic (including data from Australian languages). A further possibility is derivational multiple case marking (""compound cases""). Here a case marker forms an oblique stem (""founding form"") that may attract further case markers. The use of a ligative (""case spacing"") can be seen as an interesting mixture of (adnominal) double case and compound case. This paper presents the results of a pilot study that includes several languages from the Pama-Nyungan and the Tangkic family. 1. Introduction. A good survey of multiple case marking in Australian languages is given in Dench and Evans 1988. Following a classification proposed in Austin 1995, three situations can be distinguished where multiple case marking may occur. The present paper is a pilot study of a special type of multiple case marking, namely, compound cases. In many Australian languages, a certain CASE1 ""requires"" that the nominal X already be marked for CASE2, so that the pattern X-CASE2-CASE1 is found. We give an example from Kalkatungu. Here we find matyumpa 'kangaroo', matyumpathu 'kangaroo + ERG', and matyumpathuŋu 'kangaroo + CAUS'. The causal suffix -ŋu requires that the noun be marked by the ergative suffix -thu. The most common situations seem to be the following (more details are given in section 4): (1) The ""outer"" CASE1 is a local case. (2) The ""inner"" CASE2 is a local case, or a case [End Page 256] marking genitive/dative, or an oblique case. (3) In some languages there is a split: for only some nominals does CASE1 require CASE2, while for others it does not. (4) For pronouns it seems to be the rule that several cases require an oblique stem that is related to the genitive or dative form. In section 2, a brief account is given on the three major subtypes of multiple case marking: derivational, adnominal, and referential. Some first examples of derivational case marking (= compound cases) are included. The following case-marking patterns within the noun phrase may be distinguished. A language is called ""phrase-marking"" if the case marker is attached to some word of the noun phrase. There are three subtypes: ""final-marking"" (the last word of the NP is marked for case), ""head-marking"" (the head of the NP is marked for case), and ""free marking"" (any word of the NP may be marked for case). A language is called ""word-marking"" if all words in the NP are marked for case. The use of a ligative (""case spacing"" in Dench and Evans 1988) is mentioned as occurring in each language in the sample. It is noted that, in the languages in the sample, pronouns distinguish two or three case forms to express the core relations S, A, and O, and typically use an oblique stem as a founding form for other cases. To make the appearance of compound cases less ""exotic,"" examples from Estonian and Slovak are discussed briefly. No attempt is made to extend this study further beyond Australian languages, although compound cases are to be found in Uralic, Caucasian, Dravidian, and other languages. Section 3 is the main part of the present study. The result of a search based on a sample of 20 Australian languages is presented. These languages are Anguthimri, Diyari, Djabugay, Djapu, Gumbaynggir, Guugu Yimidhirr, Kalkatungu, Madhimadhi, Margany/Gunya, Mbabaram, Ngiyambaa, Nyawaygi, Panyjima, Pitta-Pitta, Uradhi, Wargamay, Watjarri, Yankunytjatjara, Yaygir, and Yukulta. The location of the languages reveals some regional features, but further investigation is needed to reach conclusions on areal diffusion or genetic relationship. In section 4, an attempt is made to summarize the result in the form of generalizations. The transcription of the Australian examples is guided by the following principles: (1) Special symbols have been avoided as much as possible and replaced by convenient digraphs (similar to the usage...",0,1
"Previous investigations of satire posit that satire comprehension is influenced by prior knowledge, satirical strategies, and other demographic features, such as age. However, these claims have not yet been tested using online processing techniques. In this study we investigate satire processing using newspaper headlines from the satirical American newspaper The Onion and nonsatirical headlines from The New York Times. Reading times and humor ratings were gathered from 76 participants using behavioral response data. Results demonstrate that a higher age results in significantly higher reading times for satirical compared with nonsatirical headlines. In addition, levels of prior knowledge significantly interacted with different satirical strategies, influencing both reading times and perceptions of humor. Measures of headline familiarity and sincerity also interacted with perceptions of humor and satirical strategy. These results provide additional evidence for the importance that age, prior knowledge, and satirical strategies have on satire comprehension.",0,1
"This article explores the ways in which constructions of identities of place are embedded in the ideology of race and social orientation in Zimbabwe. Using newspaper reports, memoirs, speeches, advertisements, fiction, interviews and ephemera produced around key discursive thresholds, it examines the production of multiple meanings of key terms within competing discourses to generate co-existing parallel lexicons. Crucially, labels like ‘settler’, ‘African’ and ‘Zimbabwean’, labels that are inextricably linked to access to and association with the land in colonial and postcolonial Zimbabwe, shift their reference and connotations for different speakers in different settings and periods. For example, the term ‘settler’, used to refer to white colonists of British origin who occupied vast agricultural lands in colonial Zimbabwe, is appropriated in post-independent Zimbabwe to designate blacks settled on the land in the Fast Track Land Reform Programme. The analysis of semantic pragmatic change in relation to key discursive thresholds yields a complex story of changing identities conditioned by different experiences of a raced national biography.",0,1

Premierement, nous remettons en question le concept de « Creole Specific Reanalysis » [Detges 2000] en discutant de l’opposition entre deux mecanismes importants du changement linguistique que sont la grammaticalisation et la reanalyse et nous menons une etude diachronique sur les marqueurs TMA en creole mauricien a partir d’un corpus de textes anciens. Par son exploitation systematique, ce travail permet d’arriver a une description de l’emergence et du developpement du systeme verbal TMA en mauricien. Deuxiemement, nous faisons une etude comparative synchronique des systemes des marqueurs TMA du mauricien et du haitien en nous appuyant sur un cadre theorique general de la temporalite et a partir de donnees contemporaines, issues entre autres d’une enquete suivant le questionnaire de Dahl [1985]. Nous presentons les elements communs et ceux qui differencient les marqueurs TMA des deux creoles en raison de leurs fonctions communicatives et de leurs semantismes dans leurs emplois et usages respectifs.",0,1
"Abstract The productivity of English derivational affixes is studied as a function of text type. Principal component analyses show that texts can be classified adequately, not only on the basis of the relative frequencies of the highest frequency words (Burrows, 1992, 1993), but also on the basis of the productivity of derivational affixes. Stylistically heterogeneous texts are clustered into text types, stylistically homogeneous texts cluster in the time dimension, allowing diachronic changes in productivity to be traced. Supplementary analyses on the basis of the relative frequencies of function words support the morphology‐based clusterings. The role and marked nature of the nonnative stratum of the lexicon is discussed in detail, as well as the way in which the rival affixes ‐ness and ‐ity, and un‐ and in‐, are put to use. The results obtained show that any theory of morphological productivity that does not take stylistic factors into account is incomplete.",0,1

"I report an empirical study deriving from a Gestalt-Interactionist approach to metaphor. Both the type of figurative expression (metaphor or simile) and the form of the expression (A is B or B is A) were manipulated in a factorial design. Subjects were asked to evaluate a given figurative expression both with regard to complexity and interest, and in terms of the degree of imageability of the tenor and the vehicle. As hypothesized, the design factors interacted in their influence on these ratings. Specifically, both the metaphor in standardform and the simile in reversed form received relatively higher ratings in degree of interest aroused and degree of complexity, while receiving relatively lower ratings in degree of vehicle imageability.",0,1
"association between, literature, and criminology is undeniable and, yet for too long those studying crime and literature respectively, have failed to see the connection between the two, or dismissed it as being irrelevant. This study explores literary pieces which deal exclusively with murder in order to prove that the two disciplines: literature and criminology are intimately connected and essentially inseparable. Some literary pieces which deal with identifying the thought processes of murderers have been so insightful that crime experts applied them to certain high-profile cases. That so much violent crime is depicted in literature should stimulate further research into the links between criminology and literature. Robert Browning's The Laboratory (1844) is selected as a case study in order to demonstrate how criminological theories can successfully be applied to literary pieces. Browning's protagonist will prove to be a fictional manifestation of a female sadistic criminal as defined by psychiatrist/criminologist Paul De River in his criminology/sexology textbook for law enforcement personnel Sexual Criminal (1949).",0,1
"Abstract The postwar decades are well known for having brought dramatic change to American linguistics on many fronts. This paper explores an internally focused aspect of this change: conditions of explanation. The two questions at stake are, firstly, what counts as explanation in linguistics? and, secondly, how is this decided? I argue that transformational grammarians dominated the setting of explanatory criteria in 1960s American syntax, and that this dominance was essential to the overall success of that theory. Importantly, rival grammarians were forced to devote as much time and effort to fitting their theories to the transformational criteria as they were to advancing their own explanatory priorities. By successfully naming the conditions for explanation, transformationalists provided their own supporters with significant questions to pursue and, simultaneously, drew energy away from rivals. This monopoly over explanatory criteria was central to the dominant position transformational grammar established in the American academic linguistics community.",0,1
"espanolLos nueve adverbios analizados en este articulo (‘exactamente’, ‘indudablemente’, ‘efectivamente’, ‘evidentemente’, ‘obviamente’, ‘seguramente’, ‘posiblemente’, ‘probablemente’, ‘supuestamente’) evaluan la certeza del enunciado al que se adjuntan; en tal sentido, el principal objetivo de este articulo es observar la relacion entre el grado de certeza y el grado de marcacion fonica observable en los valores de F0 y de duracion silabica. Para ello, se han recogido 126 archivos de audio procedentes de corpus de espanol espontaneo (Corpus Val.Es.Co, COLA, Corpus de Referencia de la Lengua Espanola Contemporanea), se han transcrito con el programa PRAAT y, posteriormente, se han analizado estadisticamente (analisis de cluster y prueba T de Student) los registros tonales y durativos de sus respectivas silabas. En general, los resultados obtenidos apuntan a una menor duracion y a un mayor incremento tonal en adverbios que expresan cautela elocutiva y cierto valor de atenuacion, como ‘probablemente’ o ‘seguramente’ EnglishThe nine adverbs examined in this study (exactamente, indudablemente, efectivamente, evidentemente, obviamente, seguramente, posiblemente, probablemente, supuestamente), evaluate the degree of certainty of a given statement. The main objective of the study was to analyze whether or not there is a relationship between the degree of certainty conveyed by each adverb and the degree of phonic markedness observed in them, expressed through factors such as pitch and syllable duration. To achieve this goal, 126 audio files collected from several spontaneous oral Spanish corpora (Val.Es.Co, COLA, CREA). Were transcribed using PRAAT software and later the tonal and durative records of each syllable were statistically analyzed (cluster analysis and Student’s t-test). In general, the results show that in adverbs expressing caution and a certain mitigating value (like probablemente o seguramente), there is a) a tendency towards a shorter duration, and b) a greater tonal increase",0,1
"Hoewel de spelling van Nederlandse verledentijdsvormen van zwakke werkwoorden algemeen als eenvoudig wordt beschouwd (ze zijn immers klankzuiver) maken zelfs universiteitsstudenten opvallend veel fouten bij de keuze tussen de uitgangen -te en -de . Voor een deel zijn die fouten ‘natuurlijk’ in die zin dat ze het gevolg zijn van de werking van frequentie en analogie. Anderzijds stellen we vast dat Nederlanders veel meer fouten maken dan Vlamingen, althans als de stam op een coronale fricatief eindigt ( s, z, f, v ). Aangezien de Nederlandse proefpersonen de ‘regel’ (het ezelsbruggetje ’t kofschip ) beter lijken te beheersen dan de Vlamingen, moet de verklaring voor het verschil gezocht worden in een klankverandering die zich wel in Nederland maar niet of nauwelijks in Vlaanderen voordoet, de verstemlozing van de fricatieven. Het spellingprobleem vraagt om didactische maatregelen en/of politieke: het kan wellicht grotendeels worden opgelost door de spellingregels een weinig aan te passen.",0,1
"Plurilingual pedagogies determine that the totality of the students’ linguistic and cultural repertoires should be brought into the teaching and learning process. Despite the still prevailing monolingual norm in educational institutions of today, more and more reports on student and teacher recognition of plurilingual approaches as a valuable resource for learning start to emerge. As one of the most multicultural and multilingual countries in the world, the UAE offers a plethora of curricula where the languages of instruction vary, thus appearing as the ideal setting to explore affordances and challenges of plurilingual pedagogies. Therefore, the goal of this study was to understand UAE K-12 teachers’ perceptions and potential uses of plurilingual instruction in their mostly bi- or multilingual classrooms. The results seem to indicate that the majority of the teachers surveyed acknowledged the value of other languages, apart from the language of instruction, as support for learning in diverse contexts, choosing to discretely challenge the monolingual stance preferred by their school policies by instinctively implementing plurilingual practices in their teaching.",0,1
"Exclusive particles, which have been attested in a wide range of languages, give rise to a rank-order interpretation and/or to an exhaustive interpretation. Based on novel data from Ga, the paper identifies an exclusive particle that not only gives rise to the exhaustive meaning but also operates on an NP denotation allowing, for example, plural count nouns to be combined with an indefinite determiner which encodes the cardinality ‘one’. In particular, the paper shows that the Ga exclusive particle too functions as Landman's (1989, 2010, 2013) group-forming operator. The Ga data thus extend the typology of exclusive particles and point to a previously unattested variation in the semantics of exclusives in a cross-linguistic perspective.",0,1
"Many children’s and school dictionaries with English as a treated language have limited user-friendliness in African communities due to the fact that they were produced for mother-tongue speakers of English. An analysis of a selection of dictionaries within this category indicates a need to go beyond the application of principles that generally distinguish children’s and school dictionaries from adult dictionaries in order to cater for additional language learners of English who also learn the language in a totally different context from that of mother-tongue speakers. Recent and current developments in South African lexicography point to an increase in the production of English dictionaries for the South African market and other African countries. These dictionaries display localised lemma selection and illustrative examples, in addition to their bilingual dimension, thereby making them sensitive to the linguistic, cultural and educational realities of English learning and use in African countries. Such aspects are identified as the core of an African user-perspective which may improve the user-friendliness of English dictionaries for African children and schools while also providing tools that may be used to establish a more solid dictionary culture in African communities.",0,1

"Thirty generative-style context sensitive rules, critically ordered, were formulated and applied to a computer input consisting of place names of English-speaking countries in English orthography. The output was a Hebrew representation of the place names as pronounced in their several countries. The high-level rules first assigned primary stress, then reduced unstressed, non-high vowels to shwa. The rest of the rules, A-rule, B-rule, etc. to Z-rule generated representations of the many-varied pronunciations of the letters in all possible contexts. To assure double stresses in compounds, e.g. Southend, Bridgeport, a list was provided of compound elements, e.g. Bridge-, Broad-, -hall, -cross, etc., with an instruction to insert a word-boundary in such compounds, so that the stress rule would apply twice and the Vowel-Reduction rule would be blocked on the first vowel of the second element of the compound. The rules for England were modified for the U.S.A. and for other English-speaking countries.",0,1
"Abstract Linguistic anthropology has remained largely unaffected by debates about ontology in other subfields. In turn, the concept of language has been conspicuously absent from ontological debates. The past few years, however, have seen attempts at articulating the two, interrogating what language is from ethnographic perspectives and extending the analytic focus to ontologies of language or linguistic natures . This article discusses such efforts and compares them to previous critical engagements with the concept of language. Calling into question the ontological equivalence of language within and across cultures, communities, and regions, it explores understandings of what language is that go against the grain of existing theoretical models.",0,1
"Abstract The present paper aims to describe the process of creating CHARG—Corpus de Habla Radiofónica de Guayaquil (the Guayaquil Radiophonic Speech Corpus). It is the first systematized spoken corpus for this rather under-researched variety of Spanish. Guayaquil is the most populated city of Ecuador, while its capital city is Quito. Therefore, Ecuador is a rare case of a Spanish-speaking country with two major urban centers that belong to two separate dialectal zones, offering a very peculiar sociolinguistic context. CHARG is a corpus composed of Guayaquil radio programs. Its structure is organized by non-linguistic criteria (program type) in order to ensure a representative and balanced sample. The paper describes the design of the corpus (defining the study population, sample and stratification) and its construction (recording procedure, speakers and speech style coding, transcription and annotation). As a result, CHARG consists of 24 h of transcriptions and annotations of recordings from 142 speakers. The paper’s potential use is twofold: since it presents a step-by-step procedure of corpus construction that can be replicated, the readers might be interested in both the procedure and the corpus itself as a research material.",0,1

"Abstract This research contrasted trained sonar operators with novices in their abilities to categorize sonar signals as being of biological or man-made origin. Although the sonar operators performed significantly better than the naive subjects, the performance of the naive subjects (d′ = 1.39) was closer to that of the sonar operators (d′ = 1.81) than to chance. Additionally, there were qualitative similarities in the two groups’ performances. In order to understand this, a new group of people listened to a subset of 76 of the sounds, and chose verbal descriptors from a detailed list of 146 words such as “pht”, “chuck-chuck”, “rainfall”, etc. to describe each sound. Analyses of the descriptor choices demonstrated that biological sound sources were identifiable as such simply because they sounded like animal noises. Man-made signals were identified as more percussive, a result confirmed by an acoustical analysis of the signals. Two scales were developed for the signals, indicating how “animal like” and how percussive they were, respectively. Either of the two scales could predict with about 75% accuracy the category of the signals, a level of accuracy equal to that of the novices, and not bested by neither a CART model nor a neural net model. A simple acoustical analysis of the percussiveness of the waveforms could predict people’s judgments, but not predict the objective classifications of the signals.",0,1
"Low rating reliability has long been the primary concern in school-based oral English achievement tests. In this study, a computer-aided rating system (CARS) was developed to improve inter- and intra-rater reliability through the instantiation of rating criteria, task division and random distribution, on-line training, reliability verification and sound wave “reading” and “writing.” A rating experiment was conducted among six raters to compare intra- and inter-rater reliability between traditional rating and rating with CARS. At the end of each round of rating, a conference was held. Both quantitative and qualitative analyses show that CARS can significantly improve inter- and intra-rater reliability, mainly through helping raters use criteria more accurately and focus more attention on rating. In addition, the research has also shed light upon further study on improving rating reliability.",0,1
"The overall interest in the present paper is equal early childhood education (ECE) in terms of educating multilingually. Instead of monoglossic bilingual education directed to some children, or monoglossic monolingual education directed to children despite language background, education for recognising and creating multilingual practices for all children is reasoned in terms of global early childhood education (GECE). The reasoning is grounded on a sociocultural understanding of learning, research on holistic multilingual education and the concept of play-responsive teaching. In the paper, a framework with principles for GECE – ECE characterised by multifaceted language ecology – is put forward. The principles concerning (i) conditions, (ii) learning contents and (iii) teaching tools are formulated to provide premises for and to be evolved through empirical research. The paper contributes to the contemporary challenge of implementing multilingual teaching approaches. Legitimising multilingual teaching in practice is considered a question for research in collaboration with teachers and professional development.",0,1
"Four factors (language [Yiddish/Hebrew], socialism/capitalism, Zionism/ Diasporism, and secularism/religion) defined the political space of interwar Polish Jewry. Language ideology was highly implicational vis-a-vis Zionism/Diasporism, but even in this connection there were exceptions, resulting in Yiddishist/Zionist combinations. Socialism/capitalism and secularism/religion were far less implicational, resulting in a substantial number of unique political combinations and an unusual number of rather small parties in addition to the few major ones. Although the political significance of language can be fully appreciated only in terms of its linkages to other major issues, some of these linkages are quite idiosyncratic and, therefore, nonimplicational.",0,1

"Abstract This article 1 provides an overview of recent literature and research on word classes, focusing in particular on typological approaches to word classification. The cross‐linguistic classification of word class systems (or parts‐of‐speech systems) presented in this article is based on statements found in grammatical descriptions of some 50 languages, which together constitute a representative sample of the world's languages. It appears that there are both quantitative and qualitative differences between word class systems of individual languages. Whereas some languages employ a parts‐of‐speech system that includes the categories verb, noun, adjective and adverb, other languages may use only a subset of these four lexical categories. Furthermore, quite a few languages have a major word class whose members cannot be classified in terms of the categories verb–noun–adjective–adverb, because they have properties that are strongly associated with at least two of these four traditional word classes (e.g. adjective and adverb). Finally, this article discusses some of the ways in which word class distinctions interact with other grammatical domains, such as syntax and morphology.",0,1
"; UT VEBLEN was an economist and sociologist!' the reader may exclaim on B reading the title of this paper. 'What connection can there be between Thorstein Veblen and linguistic theory?' The answer is that he discussed linguistic matters explicitly in one passage at the very end of his Theory of the Leisure Class,x a passage which deserves to be better known among linguistic analysts than it is, and that the rest of his work develops several concepts which are of considerable usefulness in understanding, not only socially conditioning factors, but some of the mechanisms underlying the use of language and linguistic change. USAGE, SPELLING, AND CONSPICUOUS WASTE. The concluding paragraphs of Chapter XIV ('The Higher Learning as an Expression of the Pecuniary Culture') of Veblen's Theory of the Leisure Class are devoted to the classics and the perpetuation of classicism as 'conforming so closely to the requirements of archaism and waste' which, according to Veblen, are the standards of virtue of the leisure class. Veblen correlates 'classic' usage with obsolescence and futility:",0,1
"Speech acquisition by Indian children is under-explored. This study investigates English-Malay speech acquisition by forty children (2;06-4; 05) of the third largest ethnic group (Indian) in Malaysia, a multi-ethnic multilingual country. The multilingual model and multilingual phonological test proposed by (Lim, Wells, & Howard, [2015] Rate of multilingual phonological acquisition: Evidence from a cross-sectional study of English-mandarin-malay. Clinical Linguistics and Phonetics, 29(11), 793–811; Lim [2018] Multilingual English-Mandarin-Malay phonological error patterns: The multilingual model and multilingual phonological test proposed in the initial cross-sectional study of 2 to 4 years old Malaysian Chinese children. Clinical Linguistics and Phonetics, 32(10), 889–912.) were used in the present assessment and analysis of child speech data. Two versions of the multilingual phonological test (English and Malay) were administered to the children. The age of phoneme acquisition and phonological patterns were analysed. The children showed comparable phonological milestones with children of other ethnic heritages acquiring the same languages. All singleton consonants were acquired by 4;06. All except one consonant cluster (/dɹ/) were acquired by 4; 06, indicating earlier acquisition than the local Chinese children in the past study. All vowels were acquired by 2; 11 and vowel phonological patterns were rare. There was a decrease with age in the use of consonant phonological patterns. Some consonant phonological patterns were shared by both languages (e.g., fronting), others were used in one language only (e.g., English cluster reduction) implicating the influences of language universalities and ambient language characteristics. Only age and language dominance factors, but not sex factor were found to have influenced the English-Malay speech acquisition. The extra exposure to Tamil by some children (38%) might have accelerated the acquisition of English clusters since Tamil shares clusters with English. The present findings contribute both clinical information to speech-language therapists and theoretical knowledge to the current literature of child phonology.",0,1

"Attention plays a role in demonstrative thought: It sets the targets. Visual experience also plays a role. I argue here that it makes visual information available for use in the voluntary control of focal attention. To do so I use both introspection and neurophysiological evidence from projections between areas of attentional control and neural correlates of consciousness. Campbell and Smithies also identify roles for experience, but they further argue that only experience can play those roles. In contrast, I argue that experience is not the only way in which visual information could be accessed for the voluntary control of attention.",0,1

"Archaeologists are often tempted to make their own contributions to the study of the evolution of cognition and language. At the same time many more researchers in other fields try to find in the archaeological literature the evidence that would disclose the steps in the evolution of these aspects of human nature. On one issue all scholars agree: The so-called Upper Paleolithic Revolution, since some 45,000 years ago, commonly characterized on the basis of Western European archaeological records, fossils and genetic evidence, is the expression of hominins like us. It is generally agreed, although not accepted by all, that due to gene flow and cultural transmissions modern humans came out of Africa and dispersed around the world. The question, however, is how much earlier were the origins of languages and cognition, and can we identify the material remains that reflect the phases that led to today's expressions, within the sequence from 3.3 or 2.6 Myr ago. This paper examines briefly the common stone tool making techniques that are still considered in the literature as a source for providing information about the evolution of cognition, along with very few comments on the pattern of seasonal/annual mobility of past groups of foragers. It reaches the conclusion that when we study not only the records of Europe, western Asia and Africa from a Western view point but also take into consideration the information from East Asia, we are forced to adopt a cautious attitude to the interpretations concerning the emergence of cognition and languages.",0,1
"A major challenge in human-robot interaction (HRI) is creating the “social fluidity” necessary for humans to perceive the interaction as life-like. During verbal interactions, for instance, the speech content itself is not the only thing that matters. Rather, things like timing, cadence, and manner of speaking are necessary to speak “like a native”, yet those attributes vary significantly by language and cultural setting. To that end, we developed a bilingual virtual avatar (Korean and English speaking) capable of autonomous speech during cooperative gameplay with a human participant in a social survival video game. We then ran a series of experiments with 60 participants (30 English speakers and 30 Korean speakers) interacting with the avatar during 30-minute game sessions. The experiments included several conditions, in which we modified the avatar's speech behavior in different ways while collecting multiple types of data (audiovisua recordings, speech data, gameplay data, human perceptions). Results showed significant differences between English and Korean speakers during the experiment. Korean speakers spoke less on average and had more negative speech sentiment, while the English speakers spoke more frequently and had more positive speech sentiment. The avatar was also more likely to interrupt the human's speech in English than Korean, despite having the same design. Furthermore, Korean speakers perceived more social presence when the avatar engaged in more repetitive speech behavior, while English speakers perceived more when the avatar was more “chatty”. We suggest that these results likely relate to cultural differences between East Asian cultures and Western cultures in terms of the social norms that govern appropriate social interaction behavior, and discuss the implications for future work on interactive speech agents.",0,1
"Abstract Cet article porte sur un problème de sémantique lexicale appliquée à un domaine particulier, celui des adjectifs préfixés par pré . Il s'agit en effet d'étudier la construction du sens de ces adjectifs, celui-ci ayant pour particularité de se construire sur deux niveaux. Les adjectifs dérivés s'interprètent en effet avec un sens d'antériorité mais aussi avec ce que j'appelle les valeurs ‘continue’ et ‘discontinue’, cette double structure interprétative étant caractéristique de l'ensemble des mots préfixés par pré - (adjectifs mais aussi noms et verbes). Il s'agira donc de mettre en évidence les mécanismes de construction du sens d'antériorité lui-même, ainsi que les principes qui régissent l'attribution des valeurs ‘continue’ et ‘discontinue’. Ceci nous permettra alors de distinguer ce qui, dans le sens des adjectifs dérivés, est à imputer à des mécanismes purement linguistiques et ce qui relève plutôt de l'ordre du culturel, i.e. des représentations et des connaissances que nous pouvons avoir sur le monde. Les adjectifs prétuberculeux et précolombien me serviront d'exemples privilégiés tout au long de ces analyses.",0,1

"We have written this article as performative co-autoethnography in which we focus on a crisis of communication we experienced as deaf/nondeaf collaborators. We bring together Deleuze's concept of ‘becoming-other’ with Guattari's concept of ‘a-signifying semiotics’ to demonstrate how a focus on the affective dynamics of a-signification allows us to attend to the immanent nature of deaf/nondeaf communication. Situating the highlighted crisis within the larger context of Joseph Valente's work as the only deaf professor within a larger, audist university culture, we work to performatively demonstrate the rich necessity of keeping the dynamic, unknowable, intense, frightening, and exciting nature of negotiating communicative differences at the forefront of our research and our day-to-day collaboration.",0,1
"Honorifics and sentence-final particles as indexical signs have been widely studied in Japanese pragmatics and sociolinguistics. Most previous studies have directly related linguistic forms to aspects of social contexts (e.g. social distance, gender), which tend to represent ‘normative’ usages, or the hegemonic linguistic ideology. Actual language practices of Japanese speakers, however, do not always conform to such ‘normative’ usages. The present study analyzes actual conversational data with regard to honorifics and ‘gendered’ sentence-final forms. The analysis reveals wide variations in their uses, including many ‘deviant’ uses. These variations suggest that social categories, such as social distance and gender, cannot be abstracted from the context as independent variables determining language choice. That is, honorifics and ‘gendered’ sentence-final forms cannot be regarded as direct indexes of contextual features. I argue that the choice of indexical expressions is a strategy that is based on the speaker's consideration of multiple social aspects of the context as well as on his/her linguistic ideology, or beliefs and attitudes concerning language use. Variations in indexical uses are then explained in terms of the complexity of social context and the diversity of linguistic ideologies that mediate indexical processes. The view of indexicality employed in this study enables us to account for variations in the use of indexicals in a coherent manner without marginalizing what may otherwise be considered ‘deviant’ practices.",0,1
"This project examines whether second-language (L2) learners can converge on a native-like pattern at the interface between syntax and discourse under low and high processing pressure, using Spanish clitic-doubled left dislocation (CLLD) as a test case. The original version of the Interface Hypothesis (IH) predicts that L2 competence on syntax-discourse interface structures may diverge from that of L1 speakers , yet there is experimental evidence of native-like offline judgments of clitic-doubling and its correlation to relevant discourse contexts in L2 Spanish. However, the most updated version of the IH argues that problems at the syntax-discourse interface are not due to divergent competence but rather to L2 processing limitations. To isolate the potential source of divergence, in the present study L2 Spanish learners completed an Acceptability Judgment Task (low processing pressure) and a Speeded Production Task (high processing pressure). Group results show convergence on the native-like pattern on the Acceptability Judgment Task and divergence on the Speeded Production Task. The first finding suggests that L2 learners have linguistic knowledge of discourse-related clitic-doubling, challenging the original version of the IH. The second finding suggests that the processing pressure induced by time constraints and production is correlated with L2 divergence, as predicted by the new version of the IH. We conclude by considering whether this divergence is most appropriately attributed to processing at the interfaces or could alternatively be explained as a result of real-time production specifically.",0,1
"Im Anschluss an mein Buch Lautverschiebungen in den germanischen Sprachen (2005) verteidigt dieser Aufsatz die Rekonstruktion der Aspiration als bewegendes Moment bei der Ersten und der Zweiten Lautverschiebung. Eine vergleichende Untersuchung über das Vorkommen der Aspiration in den modernen germanischen Sprachen und Dialekten zeigt, dass die Aspiration ohne Zweifel eine entscheidende Rolle bei der Entwicklung des germanischen Konsonantismus gespielt hat. Fast alle modernen germanischen Dialekte, nicht nur die hochdeutschen, haben also in irgendeiner Form an der Zweiten Lautverschiebung teilgenommen. Dialekte, die keine Aspiration aufweisen, beruhen entweder auf Substrateinwirkungen oder bewahren noch den Zustand aus der Zeit vor der Zweiten Lautverschiebung. Besonders einschlägig in diesem Zusammenhang ist der Fall des Niederländischen, das für seine Aspirationslosigkeit bekannt ist.",0,1
"Abstract Recent evolutionary experimental psychological research found that high verbal proficiency (VP) increased the perceived attractiveness of individuals (more so for males than females), especially in the context of a long-term relationship. Our study had the objective of replicating and extending this research. Similar to previous studies, audio files in which speakers performed scripted self-presentations that had equal content but varied on VP were used as stimuli for opposite-sex participants. VP was found to increase attractiveness ratings. The effects were mostly small for numerous variables relating to short-term mating, whereas they were moderate to large for long-term mating. Our participants attributed more future income, but not more total number of mates to speakers with higher VP. Female menstrual cycle effects on attractiveness ratings were not found. Contrary to former research, being more verbally proficient was not found to be more beneficial for one sex over the other.",0,1
"Although institutional discourse is subject to a vast ensemble of constraints, its design is not fixed beforehand. On the contrary, optimizing the satisfaction of these constraints requires considerable discourse design skills from institutional agents. In this article, we analyze how Dutch banks' mortgage advisors navigate their way through the consultations context. We focus on what we call discourse design explications, that is, stretches of talk in which participants refer to conflicting constraints in the discourse context, at the same time proposing particular discourse designs for dealing with these conflicts. We start by discussing three forms of design explication. Then we will examine the various resolutions they propose for constraint conflicts and show how advisors seek customer consent or cooperation for the proposed designs. Thus our analysis reveals how institutional agents, while providing services, work on demonstrating how the design of these services is optimized and tailored to customers.",0,1

"1. The phonemic system of Old English has become a matter of increasing interest to linguists in recent years. Twenty years ago, structural linguists seldom concerned themselves with the phonemes of a 'dead' language, while traditional linguists and philologists generally regarded phonemes as something exotic, something outside the purview of normal language activities and studies. Since 1939, however, we have seen a fair number of publications dealing with the Old English phonemic system or portions of it, written either from a structural viewpoint or in a manner which indicates an awareness of the structural problems of the language.l Very few of these studies deal with more than a small segment of the Old English phonemic system; most of them attack some portion of something which is described as the 'traditional interpretation' or the 'traditional view'. To my knowledge, no one has yet given us an account of all the Old English phonemes from the viewpoint of the traditional linguists. There are several reasons for this",0,1
"There is now a well-established literature showing that people anticipate upcoming concepts and words during language processing. Commonsense knowledge about typical event sequences and verbal selectional preferences can contribute to anticipating what will be mentioned next. We here investigate how temporal discourse connectives (before, after), which signal event ordering along a temporal dimension, modulate predictions for upcoming discourse referents. Our study analyses anticipatory gaze in the visual world and supports the idea that script knowledge, temporal connectives (before eating → menu, appetizer), and the verb’s selectional preferences (order → appetizer) jointly contribute to shaping rapid prediction of event participants.",0,1
"Abstract We investigate empirically whether framing in general, and the use of Simplifying Models as a framing tool in particular, has an effect on the way topics are cognitively construed. Existing studies on framing in linguistics have either been theoretical or descriptive. Going beyond such methodologically simple approaches, we use a more rigid test design involving the use of a control group, the construction of test conditions in which different Simplifying Models constitute the major source of variation, the inclusion of independent variables like age and prior knowledge of the subjects, and the use of linear and logistic regression analysis. Our results show that our more rigid methodological approach yields a more reliable image of the effect of Simplifying Models on the way in which people deal with information on a complex topic like sustainable food production. Fleshing out these effects further may in time lead to a better informed construction of communication on complex social topics.",0,1
"The consideration of word length as a distinctive feature of different texts, varieties or languages is grounded on a long lasting tradition within the field of quantitative linguistics. The idea that word length plays an important role in linguistic self-regulation was already introduced by G.K.

The data show: (1) so, while being less frequent than certainly and definitely, covaries with them; (2) young female characters are most likely to use GenX so; (3) so going to exhibits a fairly restricted collocational range compared to the other emphasizers, particularly in negated utterances; and (4) second-person subjects (you) favor this new construction.

"Abstract This study investigated the psychometric properties of self-regulating capacity in vocabulary learning scale (Tseng, Dornyei, &amp; Schmitt, 2006) in the Iranian EFL context. For this purpose, a sample of 1167 high school students completed the Persian SRCvoc in the main phase. The internal consistency reliability of the scale was examined using Cronbach’s alpha. It showed acceptable reliability in both piloting and main phases. The results of exploratory factor analysis (EFA) showed that the SRCvoc is composed of three factors. However, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) on the three-factor model of the SRCvoc and Tseng et al.’s (2006) five-factor model of the SRCvoc with item-level indicators showed that both models did not fit the data. The findings of this study imply that the item-parcels in Tseng et al. (2006) may have masked the nature of the factor structure of the self-regulating capacity in vocabulary learning scale. It should therefore be re-theorized.",0,1
"SEMANTICS OF VERBS AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF VERB INFLECTION IN CHILD LANGUAGE Lois Bloom, Karin Lifter, and Jeremie Hafitz Teachers College, Columbia University The longitudinal emergence of verb inflections (-ing, -s, and -«//irreg) was observed in the spontaneous speech offour American English-speaking children. The occurrence of the inflections, their linguistic/non-linguistic contexts, and the conditional use of the inflections (occurrence in optional or obligatory contexts) are described. The major results of the study are that the inflections -ing, -s, and irreg emerged in the children's speech at the same time, but were distributed selectively with different populations of verbs. The results are discussed in terms of two major factors in the emergence of the verb inflections: the sentence relations between verbs and other constituents, and the semantics of verb aspect. The results are consistent with the general principle of Aspect before tense in linguistic theory and in language development , and provide indirect evidence about the rules that children learn for verb inflectional morphology.* The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship of the semantic organization of verbs used in early sentences vis-à-vis the first emergence of the inflections ofthe verb auxiliary (-ing, -s, -ed/iKREG). In discussions ofthe acquisition of grammatical morphemes by Brown 1973, de Villiers & de Villiers 1973, and others, only the syntax and semantics (along with environmental frequency) of the individual morphemes themselves have been seriously discussed as contributing to the order in which they are acquired. However, the results ofthe present study suggest that the semantic organization ofthe verb system that children learn is at least as important as the meanings of the verb inflections for determining their acquisition. Background 1. There have been few studies of the semantics of verbs in children's early sentences. Bloom, Lightbown & Hood 1975 observed developmental differences between verbs of action and state, and between locative and non-locative actions and states. Bloom, Miller & Hood 1975 extended the categorization of locative verbs, and described three semantic/syntactic subcategories of locative verbs that differed according to the relationship between a verb and its pre-verb and post-verb constituents (subject-verb and verb-complement). Bowerman 1974 used 'error' data to describe the emergence of causative verbs in her two-year-old daughter's language. The implication of these studies is that children learn the verbs of the language as a system and that verbs do not enter children's vocabularies one at a * The data analysis reported here was begun originally in collaboration with Peggy Miller, and we are grateful for her participation in the early stages of the study. We also thank Ellen Tanouye and Ira Blake for their help in processing portions of the data for a preliminary version of this paper. We have benefited from discussions with Kathleen Fiess, Lorraine Harner, Lois Hood, Margaret Lahey, Michael Maratsos, Elissa Newport, Richard Sanders, Owen Whitby, and Richard Wojcik. Early reports of the results of the study were presented in 1977 to meetings of the Society for Research in Child Development, the Canadian Linguistic Institute, the American Speech and Hearing Association, and in 1978 to the Symposium on Tense and Aspect, Brown University. Financial support for the research was provided by research grants from the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health. 386 DEVELOPMENT OF VERB INFLECTION IN CHILD LANGUAGE 387 time, as a function only of events in the context. This implication is supported by results of the study reported here. There have been many and varied studies ofchildren's acquisition ofgrammatical morphemes. Most have been experimental, exploring children's knowledge of morphological rales for adding affixes to nonsense words, in the tradition of Berko 1958. Other studies have been observational (e.g. Brown, Cazden 1968, and de Villiers & de Villiers), describing correlations between use ofparticular morphemes and increase in utterance length. The implications of these studies are that the grammatical morphemes are learned sequentially, and apply in general to all of a child's verbs. These implications are not supported by the results of the present study. Brown (320) discussed the possibility that different verb inflections might be learned for different categories of verbs, e.g. 'process' and 'state' verbs; and Antinucci & Miller 1976 observed...",0,1
Abstract The New Statistics is an approach to scholarly research which offers an alternative to the problematic overreliance on significance testing currently plaguing the research literature. This paper describes the problems associated with significance testing and introduces the key concepts of the data-analysis that best fits with the goals of the New Statistics: estimation of effect sizes and confidence intervals. These concepts will be applied in a reanalysis of the summary data from an article that was recently published in this journal. This makes it possible to compare the estimation approach advocated by the New Statistics to the standard significance tests and to discuss potential drawbacks of this approach as a means of gathering quantitative evidence in support of our substantive hypotheses.,0,1
"Prior work demonstrated that toddlers can learn words from a speaker with a foreign accent and generalize that learning to the native accent when the accented variation does not cross phoneme boundaries. The current study explores the situation in which a vowel in the foreign accent is produced such that it could be confused with a different intended vowel in the native accent. Children were taught two new word-object pairings by a foreign-accented speaker; when vowels were produced similarly across accents, toddlers aged 32 months successfully accommodated a change in accent between training and test; when a novel word contained a vowel that was more affected by accent, toddlers did not later recognize the words in their native accent. This suggests that toddlers may face added difficulty when learning words from speakers of different accents when there is the potential for phonetic confusion across vowels.",0,1
"1.1. The CONSONANTS are /p, t, k, b, d, g, f, s, )i, v, z, ), m, n, fi, 1, r, y/.

Speakers who do not distinguish in the pairs cited probably have no final consonants, but only /Ca/. The consonant /n/ occurs as syllableand word-final, forming with preceding vowels the phonetic entities described as nasalized vowels: chien /gien/ 'dog', roman /roman/ 'novel', bon /bon/ 'good' (masc.), jeun /ien/ 'fasting', contrasting with chienne /giena/ 'bitch', romane /romana/ 'Romanic' (fem.), bonne /bona/ 'good' (fem.), jeune / i0ne/ 'young'.

"The domain of space presents some interesting properties. On the one hand, spatial understanding by human beings is said to be universal and to share the same biological heritage; one the other hand, the linguistic systems encoding spatial knowledge vary strikingly. This paradox raises fundamental questions, including for language typology. In this context, the present study examines adults' expression of caused motion events in Chinese versus English in the frameworks proposed by Talmy, Toward a cognitive semantics, vol. 2: Typology and process in concept structuring, MIT Press, 2000 (i.e., verb-framed versus satellite-framed) and Slobin, The many ways to search for a frog: linguistic typology and the expression of motion events, Lawrence Erlbaum, 2004 (i.e., equipollently framed) regarding the expression of spatial information across languages. The results of a cartoon-based production task reveal that, although both languages tend to express equally frequently the same set of semantic components for motion (Path, Manner, Cause, etc.), Chinese greatly differs from English in terms of where this information is encoded and how it is distributed across utterances. On the basis of these findings, it is suggested that it is better to understand Chinese on its own merits: this language shows both satellite- and verb-framing properties, thus demonstrating a “parallel” system.",0,1

"This study investigates Spanish light verb constructions (LVCs), or construcciones con verbo soporte, such as dar respuesta and tomar en cuenta in a seven-million-word corpus of contemporary newspaper texts from seven Latin American countries. I provide a detailed discussion of the procedure of compiling the corpus to ensure a balanced representation of newspaper registers. This is followed by a description of how the targeted verbs, dar, poner, tener and tomar, were identified and tagged using corpus analysis software. The results of the corpus search are analysed in terms of frequency, and selected morphosyntactic and textual features, such as the distance between components, tense, number and mood of the light verb, adjectival modification, article use, complex LVCs, and the occurrence of multiple LVCs. The results, supported by numerous examples in Spanish from the corpus, provide further evidence of the wide variation in form and use found among many LVCs.",0,1
"We examine the relation between ne...pas rien and ne...pas aucun in 17th and 18th centuries French negative contexts, in Standard French but also in vernacular French. We make the hypothesis that the source of negative concord with pas + Neg Word is not linked to the deletion of ne and the weakening of pas but is rather triggered by changes which affected the value of the negative word itself. We argue that, as in forclusive contexts, the Neg word is analyzed as an polarity item in the context ne...pas rien/aucun. This polarity reading in that context disappears during Classical Standard French with the fixation of the two-terms negation (ne... N-word) and the reanalysis of rien as an negative adverb. However,the polarity item reading has been maintained in vernacular French for rien and aucun, more particularly in contexts where the polarity item is modified.",0,1
"This article consists of three parts. First of all it briefly presents the Hub-and-Spoke Model. This model has been introduced by Martin in 1996 and further developed in the course of time with the aim to derive bilingual dictionaries out of monolingual ones in a cost-effective way. (Spoke) Languages therefore are not linked directly to each other but via a hub language. Important in this model is the level of linking, the linking rules (of spoke-to-hub) and the derivation rules (of spoke-to-spoke via the hub). In a second instance the difficulties of SIMuLLDA with regard to scaling up the system and transforming natural language definitions into formal expressions are discussed. In a final section frames are proposed as a solution to make both the Hub-and-Spoke approach and SIMuLLDA better.",0,1

C’est dans cette perspective que se revele alors dans le texte des Memoires toute l’importance des discours rapportes et des procedes de recomposition de l’Histoire.",0,1

"The present study has adopted a quantitative approach to examining the treatment of person, place and time deictic expressions in example sentences in five English learners' dictionaries, viz., OALD6 (2000), LDOCE4 (2003), COBUILD4 (2003), CALD2 (2003) and MEDAL1 (2002). To what extent do and should example sentences ‘inherit’ deictic expressions—a discoursal feature—from natural discourse? The deictic usage in example sentences may somehow be constrained by dictionary space. Yet, the results from the sample data indicate that, in spite of some variations, the types and frequencies of deictic expressions in example sentences largely correspond to those in normal discourse. The findings shed light on ESL lexicographers' strategies for retention of person deictics from a real-text corpus into example sentences, highlight the role of spoken data in a corpus, and support the selection of tenses in example sentences by verb semantics.",0,1

"The linear source-filter model of speech production assumes that the source of the speech sounds is independent of the filter. However, acoustic simulations based on the physical speech production models show that when the fundamental frequency of the source harmonics approaches the first formant of the vocal tract filter, the filter has significant effects on the source due to the nonlinear coupling between them. In this study, two interactive system models are proposed under the quasi steady Bernoulli flow and linear vocal tract assumptions. An algorithm is developed to estimate the model parameters. Glottal flow and the linear vocal tract parameters are found by conventional methods. Rosenberg model is used to synthesize the glottal waveform. A recursive optimization method is proposed to find the parameters of the interactive model. Finally, glottal flow produced by the nonlinear interactive system is computed. The experimental results show that the interactive system model produces fine details of glottal flow source accurately.",0,1

I argue that the account secures determinate content only by appeal to pragmatic considerations, and so it fails to respect naturalism.

"Em português contemporâneo, verbos como considerar e entender contrastam nos seus usos mais ‘lexicais’, mas aproximam-se no seu funcionamento em construções nas quais são gerados valores caraterizáveis como epistémicos, no sentido em que há uma marcação linguística da validação subjetiva do que é expresso. No presente trabalho pretende-se investigar os fatores que terão determinado, em diacronia, a emergência desses valores, vindo, portanto, a determinar uma convergência (necessariamente não plena) entre considerar e entender nos seus usos (mais) gramaticais, sempre considerando a oposição ‘lexical’ / ‘gramatical’ como uma oposição não discreta. Tendo em vista este objetivo, apresentam-se e discutem-se dados relativos a consirar e entender recolhidos em textos dos períodos antigo e médio da história da língua portuguesa (séculos XIII a XV), que foram selecionados em função da datação dos testemunhos, diversidade genológica e fiabilidade das edições. Identificam-se as várias construções em que consirar e entender ocorrem e assinalam-se diferentes tipos de fatores que aparentemente determinam a possibilidade de leituras epistémicas. Os dados levantados evidenciam diferentes fases do processo de emergência de valores epistémicos entre os dois verbos, mas revelam também, aparentemente, a interferência de fatores contextuais do mesmo tipo na emergência desse tipo de interpretação, o que teria determinado a sua tendencial convergência nos usos epistémicos. Conclui-se com breves notas sobre caminhos a explorar no alargamento futuro da investigação, nomeadamente incluindo outras formas / construções em competição, quer com verbos, como achar e julgar, que sincronicamente mostram restrições de ocorrência distintas de considerar e entender, quer com os verbos haver e ter, que exibem funcionamentos tipicamente mais gramaticalizados, e que no passado da língua podiam também, em diferentes construções, ter valores caraterizáveis como epistémicos.",0,1
"This article first examines representations of women's desire in Tamil cinema, from highly implicit and non‐transgressive representations of desire in an older movie to linguistically explicit and transgressive representations of desire in a recent hit movie. We then examine how such contemporary filmic representations are related to what we call a mode of realist spectatorship, and how this mode of spectatorship is linked to a particular social group (male youth) and to film form. We argue that the emergence of this mode of spectatorship, the films associated with it, and their connection to male youth are due to changes in the film market and to differential socialization by generation. Finally, we argue for realism in film as holding when film form and spectatorship are highly calibrated in the following way: some set of filmic representations are evaluated by viewers and filmmakers through culturally mediated classifications of ""real"" and ""unreal"" which are operationalized truth‐functionally in events of evaluation; such representations presuppose these classifications, and by virtue of regular presupposition can entail an experience of ""reality"" for viewers.",0,1
"1.1. It has long seemed to me to be probable that in several Algonquian languages the transitive verb-forms of the independent mode meaning 'I-thee' have lost a final syllable that would seem to be logically demanded to indicate the subject, namely the pronominal element for 'I', which, in that mode, is well known to have been PA *ne.

Such companies as well as those factors play a key role in the creation and adoption of neoliberal policies that, since the 80s, have been unleashed all around the world; which is why, it is essential to analyse them when dealing with alternative policies aimed at creating a different globalization. This paper is divided into four parts. The first tackles some central, clarifying elements about capitalism, taking into account that the process of the globalization-internationalization of capital is going through an acceleration process. Based on that, we can get an idea about the current transnational companies. The second part discusses some of the policies that transnational companies follow as regards competition among countries and among employees, such being one of the nodal aspects on which neoliberal economy rests. In the third part, we provide a short explanation about the policies that transnational companies have so far adopted on an international scale as regards the appropriation of human knowledge and which have been mentioned in discussions concerning «intellectual property rights» as well as in «agreements on bilateral protection of investments». Finally, some proposals and deliberations are provided on various measures to be taken at an international scale, so as to favour the emergence of another type of globalization and a greater control over transnational companies.",0,1
"Abstract: Recent experimental findings by Knobe and others (Knobe, 2003; Nadelhoffer, 2006b; Nichols and Ulatowski, 2007) have been at the center of a controversy about the nature of the folk concept of intentional action. I argue that the significance of these findings has been overstated. My discussion is two-pronged. First, I contend that barring a consensual theory of conceptual competence, the significance of these experimental findings for the nature of the concept of intentional action cannot be determined. Unfortunately, the lack of progress in the philosophy of concepts casts doubt on whether such a consensual theory will be found. Second, I propose a new, deflationary interpretation of these experimental findings, ‘the trade-off hypothesis’, and I present several new experimental findings that support this interpretation.",0,1
"Abstract The translation and study of Virginia Woolf began in the late 1920s out of pure artistic interest, then became stagnant due to the extreme tendencies of the left-wing movement. In the new era, when the literary exchange between the East and the West resumed, the Chinese translation and study of Woolf came to flourish in literary circles with the second wave of Modernism and the rise of feminist criticism. This paper, by combining the historical development with the cultural context, conducts a full-scale inquiry into the features of the Chinese translation and study of Woolf during the period of the Republic of China (1929–1949) and the period of the new age since the reform and opening-up (1978–) and gives a detailed analysis of the spiritual connection between Woolf’s cultural view of feminism and contemporary Chinese feminist writers.",0,1
"The question of whether conscious experience is restricted by cognitive access and exhausted by report, or whether it overflows it—comprising more information than can be reported—is hotly debated. Recently, we provided evidence in favor of Overflow, showing that observers discriminated the color‐diversity (CD) of letters in an array, while their working‐memory and attention were dedicated to encoding and reporting a set of cued letters. An alternative interpretation is that CD‐discriminations do not entail conscious experience of the underlying colors. Here we argue, based on conceptual considerations and consistency with neuroscience and phenomenology, in favor of the Overflow interpretation.",0,1
"This paper discusses the role that culture plays in the configuration of one of the most crucial meaning mechanisms in cognitive linguistics, namely conceptual metaphors, which are defined as mappings between two different conceptual domains. These mappings are embodied, that is, grounded in our sensorimotor, cultural, and social experience of the world around us. This paper argues that culture is a key concept for the explanation of how conceptual metaphors emerge from our knowledge structures. It proposes the need of a culture sieve that manipulates culture elements in two ways. On the one hand, it “filters” those elements that are in accordance with the premises of a given culture, and on the other, it “impregnates” the mapping with touches of a culture in contrast with other cultural and social systems. The paper is divided in two main parts: First, an overview of the relationship between metaphor, embodiment and culture in cognitive linguistics is provided. Second, the importance of the culture sieve is illustrated with two case studies from two popular conceptual domains in metaphor studies: perception and body-parts.",0,1
"Inclusory Pronominals1 Frantisek Lichtenberk Many Austronesian (and other) languages contain one or more syntactic constructions of the following basic kinds: PETER WE(DUAL)WENT FISHING and/ or PETER WE(DUAL)-WENT FISHING, which can be glossed as 'Peter and I went fishing' or 'I went fishing with Peter'. The independent pronoun or the dependent pronominal (such as an affix) identifies a set of participants that includes the one or those referred to by the lexical noun phrase. Pronominal forms with this function are ""inclusory."" Constructions with inclusory pro-nominals have usually been analyzed as coordinate or comitative. The purpose of the paper is a detailed investigation of the syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic properties of the two types of inclusory-pronominal construction found in Toqabaqita, arguing that they are neither coordinate nor comitative. One type is a noun phrase with the inclusory pronoun as its head and the lexical noun phrase as its modifier. In the other type, the inclusory function is borne by a dependent pronominal. It is mismatch in the values of morpho-syntactic features that identifies constructions of the latter type as inclusory. This also shows that dependent pronominals may be independently meaningful rather than merely agreement phenomena. 1. Introduction. Quite a few languages—Austronesian as well as others—have constructions that are analogous to that found in Toqabaqita, exemplified (in boldface) in (1):2 [End Page 1] (1) Kamareqa doqora-ku meki lae ma-i qusungadi. 1DU(EXCL) brother-1SG.PERS 1DU(EXCL).FUT go VENIT-at tomorrow 'I and my brother will come tomorrow.' Although the Toqabaqita sentence is best translated as 'I and my brother will come tomorrow', and although it contains a direct counterpart of 'my brother' (doqora-ku), it does not contain a first-person singular pronoun. Instead, it contains the first-person dual exclusive independent pronoun kamareqa (and also the first-person dual exclusive future tense subject marker meki, which agrees with the independent pronoun). Importantly, sentence (1) makes a statement about two and only two individuals: the speaker and his/her brother. The independent pronoun identifies the total set of participants (two), and the following lexical noun phrase identifies a subset (the speaker's brother).That is, the referent of the lexical NP is included in the set identified by the pronoun. In the discussion that follows, a pronominal form that identifies a total set of participants, a subset of which is identified by a lexical NP, will be referred to as an ""inclusory pronominal."" The term ""pronominal"" is a convenient cover term for independent personal pronouns and various dependent forms that exhibit distinctions that are the same as, or similar to, those found with the independent pronouns, such as subject and object markers; see meki in (1) above. Inclusory pronominals are not special forms distinct from noninclusory pronominals (and ""inclusory"" is not the same as ""inclu-sive""). The term ""inclusory pronoun"" will be used to refer specifically to independent personal pronouns that are inclusory. The lexical noun phrase that identifies a subset of the set encoded by an inclusory pronominal will be referred to as the ""included noun phrase."" The central concern of this study is an investigation of the syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic properties of constructions with inclusory pronominals, or inclu-sory constructions for short, in Toqabaqita, an Oceanic language spoken on Malaita, Solomon Islands.3 I leave it to experts on other languages that have constructions with inclusory pronominals to decide which, if any, of the conclusions reached here are applicable to those languages as well. The structure of the paper is as follows: in section 2, I exemplify and discuss basic types of constructions with inclusory pronominals, two of which are found in Toqabaqita. Section 3 brie³y considers some earlier studies of inclusory constructions. Section 4 contains a detailed discussion of one of the two types of inclusory construction in Toqabaqita, and in section 5 the other type is discussed. Section 6 looks at the pragmatic properties of the first type of inclusory construction. The paper concludes with some general remarks in section 7. As will be seen in sections 2 and 3, there are two main types of analysis of constructions...",0,1
"The present study examines the relationship between pictorial similes and hybrid pictorial metaphors. The results suggest that hybrid pictorial metaphors are perceived more strongly than pictorial similes when they are presented on their own and in corrective convention but not when they are verbalized. We argue that hybrid pictorial metaphors have transformational effects as the fusion of two concepts allow the reader to see one thing in terms of another. Juxtaposition in a pictorial simile merely suggests a search for similarity, which is not explicit. Results also showed that verbalized metaphor (X is Y) or the simile (X is like Y) forms are often used to convey a similar meaning and strength for pictorial simile and pictorial metaphor. However, in corrective scenarios participants are forced to reassess visual features: in this situation, pictorial metaphors are considered more strongly than pictorial similes even when they are verbalized.",0,1

"1. BILINGUALISM AND BORROWING. As early as 1886, Hermann Paul pointed out that all borrowing by one language from another is predicated on some minimum of bilingual mastery of the two languages.' For any large-scale borrowing a considerable group of bilinguals has to be assumed. The analysis of borrowing must therefore begin with an analysis of the behavior of bilingual speakers. A vast literature has come into being on the subject of borrowing, particularly in the historical studies of individual languages; but there is still room for discussion of the relationship between the observed behavior of bilingual speakers and the results of borrowing as detected by linguists. Any light that can be thrown on the question by a study of bilingual speakers should be welcome to all students interested in borrowing and in the general linguistic problems associated with this process.2 In the present article an effort will be made to define more precisely the terminology used in the linguistic analysis of borrowing, and to set up certain hypotheses concerning the process of borrowing. It should then be possible to test these by their usefulness of application to particular studies of bilingualism and borrowing.3",0,1
"Discussion about the relations between the levels of linguistic analysis involves the problems of “direction” or logical progression within a hierarchy and of the status of the “end points”, phonetics and meaning. The viewpoint presented envisages grammar as the central part of linguistic analysis, phonetics as the ultimate justification, and phonology as the bridge between these two; only in the loosest sense are the relations between the levels hierarchical.",0,1
"Abstract This article demonstrates that Japanese minimizers, which are originally used as Negative Polarity Items in a negative context, can sometimes behave as focus markers when used postnominally. I will review a previous syntactic analysis of English minimizers, and propose a revised syntactic analysis of Japanese minimizers, based on newly discovered synchronic and diachronic facts. I argue that the usage of Japanese minimizers as focus markers was developed through grammaticalization as Upward Reanalysis along the nominal spine.",0,1
"This paper presents evidence for variation in the relative position of NegP within the IP complex from a single language family. Whereas previous studies of the position of NegP have relied on such data as word or affix order, or negative scope, this paper uses evidence from the syntactic interaction of bound and free morphemes to determine the position of NegP relative to TP. The data from the Finno-Ugric languages suggests that there are two sub-groups within this family: Mordva, Mari, Komi, Udmurt, and Livonian, in which NegP is generated below TP, and Finnish, Karelian, Ingrian, Vepsian, Votian, Estonian, and Saami, in wich NegP is generated above TP. Since it is commonly assumed that variation in languages should be restricted to the Lexicon, it is posited here that the variation in the position of NegP reflects language specific lexical features of Neg0.",0,1

"In the blocked cyclic naming task, native Mandarin speakers named pictures with disyllabic names in small sets and blocks, with the critical manipulation whether pictures within a block shared an atonal syllable or not. We found the expected facilitation when the overlapping portion of responses was in word-initial position, but we also replicated a recent observation that with ‘inconsistent’ overlap (shared syllables could be either in first or second word position), form overlap causes interference. Crucially, interference also occurred when phonologically unrelated filler trials or trials which required a nonlinguistic response were interleaved with the critical pictures. The same pattern was found with written responses and orthographic radical overlap. The results are best explained via “competitive incremental learning” between lexical and phonological representations. A computer simulation confirms that this principle generates interference, and that the result is unaffected by filler trials. We conclude that incremental learning constitutes a universal principle in the mapping from semantics to phonology in language production.",0,1
"Regional identity does not always neatly correspond to geography. In the cognitive conception of many people, Appalachia is located firmly in the American South although the official boundaries range from Alabama to New York. There are undoubtedly differing levels of regional affiliation even by people who orient toward the region. The core area of Appalachian identity, with the strongest regional affiliation, is located in the Southern Appalachian subregion and includes eastern Tennessee, western North Carolina, southwestern Virginia, eastern Kentucky, and southern West Virginia. The present case study investigates the idea of rootedness, or connection to the conceptual Appalachia, taking/AI/monophthongization, a classic Southern feature, as a marker of rootedness. Tokens from a single speaker born and raised in East Tennessee, are examined at two different times. As a high school student, the speaker produces almost categorical monophthongal/AI/; however, as a professional in her mid-30s, the speaker is almost categorically diphthongal. This stark change in linguistic behavior undoubtedly has many sources, yet the speaker discusses how her orientation to the region changed dramatically. The current study furthers our understanding of how speakers negotiate a nuanced Southern and Southern Appalachian regional identity identity and employ linguistic resources to reflect shifting orientations.",0,1

What has, until now, remained mysterious is how Kerinci became so different from other Malayic languages.",0,1

"Absent apologies—apologies that were expected but are not forthcoming—are quite frequently identified and commented on, for instance in the media. In this article we discuss two kinds of evidence that apologies can be noticeably absent for participants in ordinary interactions. The first kind is the delays that can occur in the progressivity in talk until an apology is forthcoming, particularly in cases where interlocutors are misaligned about culpability for a transgression. Such cases typically involve pursuit of an appropriate apology (admission) and an account for the other's (mis)conduct. The second kind of evidence is that where speakers fail to apologize for a putative transgression, their interlocutors can nevertheless treat the other's prior turn as though it had been an apology by absolving them of culpability in the standard way (e.g., ‘that's alright’). We show that such absolution can occur irrespective of whether culpability is admitted and an apology proffered.",0,1
"The expectation of the National Curriculum Development Centre (NCDC) of Uganda is that, using a thematic curriculum, learners in rural schools will learn at least 800 English words after three years of instruction in the language as a subject. This article draws on available literature on vocabulary learning by children and on results from a study conducted in four rural Ugandan primary schools. The study focused on the difficulties that learners in rural Ugandan schools experience in learning English, and the findings indicate that the expectation of acquiring 800 words in three years is unrealistic. The reasons for the failure to reach the 800-word target include a lack of availability of learning and teaching support materials, rural learners’ limited exposure to English inside and outside of the classroom, teachers’ low levels of English proficiency, and the limited time allocated to learning English. Recommendations are made for revisions to the curriculum and for improved support for teachers.",0,1
"This paper discuss the two orders of language as introduced by Nigel Love. Focussing on the methodological problem of their being presented as (at least in theory) distinct from one another, I argue that they would be better construed as classifications the analyst might use, as opposed to being presented as a distinction borne out when one looks at the world and language use within it. Using insights from Oliver Sacks’ studies of autism, I argue that it is with autistic individuals that the greatest distinction between the orders can be found, and that where the interest is not pathological, it is in the integration of the two theoretical orders where we can find most fruitful ground for study.",0,1
"This study examines sex differences in emotion word use in retrospective private and public relationship dissolution accounts through two studies. Study 1 (n = 423) found men’s use of negative emotion words in private breakup accounts correlated with their use of negative emotion words in their public accounts; however, women’s emotion words in their private breakup accounts did not correlate with their use of emotion words in their public accounts. Study 2 (n = 284) replicated Study 1 with a broader sample and revealed the same pattern of negative emotion word use. These studies suggest that after a breakup women and men may process emotions differently in their public and private breakup accounts depending on their audience. The findings offer insights into how relationship dissolution model processes, evolutionary mating strategies, and self-presentation may influence linguistic variations accounting for sex differences.",0,1

"The Oxford Children's Word of the Year for 2021 was anxiety, reflecting the influence of two years of a global pandemic on children's language. Over the same period, new terms such as social distancing entered the language, and existing words like bubble took on new meanings. This paper describes the methods used by Oxford children's dictionaries to capture such changes and to use them to inform the development of dictionaries for children. It draws on examples from past and current children's dictionaries to show the development of key features, such as child-oriented definitions and citations from children's literature, and discusses the influence of external factors on dictionary content over the past decade. Case studies using the Oxford Children's Language Corpus (OCLC) show how it supports the creation of creative and innovative dictionaries such as the Oxford Roald Dahl Dictionary and curriculum-driven subject dictionaries like the Oxford Illustrated Computing Dictionary. The inclusion in the OCLC of data from the BBC 500 Words children's writing competition has also influenced the content of current dictionaries. Finally, the growth of digital platforms, apps, and educational technologies leads to a discussion of the potential role of automation in children's lexicography in the twenty-first century.",0,1

In this article we develop in depth the market mechanisms and institutional constraints that shape the valuation and social expansion of Spanish in El Paso, Texas. The study finds that in sectors with low skills and low linguistic intensity, linguistic management policies are effectively ``Spanish-only''. However, as skills increase and there is a greater need for regulated communication in the occupational role, more constraints are observed on how Spanish functions in work use and professional careers.",0,1

"A substantial research endeavour carried out by a team of three theoretical linguists and a law professor on three cases pending before the US Supreme Court in its 1993-4 term resulted in a major law review article which was sent to the Court while the cases were being considered.

In one of the cases there is reason to believe that the team's analysis may have contributed to the Court's decision and opinion; in another, the concurring opinion seems to have rested directly on the team's analysis; and in the third, although the opinion showed no evidence of reliance on the team's research, the decision was nonetheless in line with the team's findings.

The second task is to account for the abilities of a teacher to question the inevitability of the medium divide and to radically reframe what is important about schooling.

"This study investigates metaphor in its role to mediate concepts in academic textbooks and promote content understanding in the English-medium instruction (EMI) context. Of particular interest is how the language of the discourse affected and possibly hindered metaphor comprehension. Drawing on the theoretical insights found in sociocultural theory and cognitive linguistics, a stance was assumed in which language is treated as embodied and contextual, and verbalizing thoughts (languaging) assists understanding. Three pairs of Japanese students with varying English proficiency levels were invited to participate in online group-based think-aloud protocols where they read and discussed selected paragraphs taken from two social and two natural science textbooks written in English. After accessing the participants’ general knowledge about the main topic of each paragraph, content understanding was accounted for in form of prompts during the think-aloud sessions and a 3-week delayed posttest. In total, over 8 hours of video data were collected, transcribed, and treated with the metaphor identification procedure MIPVU. Qualitative inspections of charged moments in discourse pinpoint metaphor as an important tool for compressing abstract entities or processes into meaningful, dense bundles of information. Participants also created their own analogies and expanded on found metaphoric expressions in textbooks when attempting to make sense of abstract phenomena in science. Further, this study confirms that the lack of English proficiency or schematic knowledge can result in non-understanding, misunderstanding, or partial understanding of metaphoric expressions which has implications for the EMI context.",0,1

"Court reporters are certified at either 95% or 98% accuracy, depending on their certifying organization; however, the measure of accuracy is not one that evaluates their ability to transcribe nonstandard dialects. Here, we demonstrate that Philadelphia court reporters consistently fail to meet this level of transcription accuracy when confronted with mundane examples of spoken African American English (AAE). Furthermore, we show that they often cannot demonstrate understanding of what is being said. We show that the different morphosyntax of AAE, the different phonological patterns of AAE, and the different accents in Philadelphia related to residential segregation all conspire to produce transcriptions that not only are inaccurate, but also change the official record of who performed what actions under which circumstances, with potentially dramatic legal repercussions for everyday speakers of AAE.",0,1
"High cellulase (endo-beta-1,4-glucanase) activity was detected in the anterior midgut of the walking stick (Phasmatodea) Eurycantha calcarata. The enzyme was isolated and analyzed via mass spectrometry. RT-PCR revealed two endoglucanase genes, EcEG1 and EcEG2. Mascot analysis of the purified enzyme confirms it to be the product of gene EcEG1. Homologous cDNAs were also isolated from a distantly related species, Entoria okinawaensis, suggesting a general distribution of cellulase genes in phasmids. Phasmid cellulases showed high homology to endogenously-produced glycoside hydrolase family 9 (GH9) endoglucanases from insects, especially to those of termites, cockroaches, and crickets. The purified E. calcarata enzyme showed clear antigency against an anti-serum for termite GH9 cellulase, which, together with the sequence homology, further suggests an endogenous origin of the enzyme. This discovery suggests a possible nutritive value for cellulose in the leaf-feeding phasmids, unlike in herbivorous Lepidoptera.",0,1

"Dans les dictionnaires de français on rencontre fréquemment, parmi les signes de transcription phonétique, le symbole [e] pour indiquer la consonne nasale palatale.

Si tel est le cas il convient de demander s'il n'est pas temps de remplacer [e] par /nj/ au niveau sousjacent. Il y a effectivement un certain nombre de phénomènes qui semblent soutenir une telle réanalyse. D'autres phénomènes, par contre, ne cadrent pas avec elle.

"This study investigates a sixth-grade L2 writer’s composition of digital multimodal texts, and his development of the metalanguage of modal and intermodal resources of language and image. Based on a systemic functional approach to multimodal discourse analysis (SF-MDA) and principles of sociosemiotic ethnography, it examines both the student’s composing processes and his composed texts. In the writing center of an inclusive sixth-grade classroom in a U.S. elementary school, the student created multimodal PowerPoint slides explaining the greenhouse effect, and Glogster-based multimedia texts arguing for banning guns. The collected data include the student’s texts, interview responses, and observation notes. Grounded in SF-MDA, the analytical framework draws on codes such as employed modes, modal resources, intermodal relations, and constructed meanings (i.e., ideational, interpersonal, and textual). The findings suggest that a) the student employed linguistic and visual modes in the mediums drawing on concurrence and complementarity intermodal relations; b) the student used non-linguistic resources for the ideational meanings of texts as a primary semiotic mode; and c) the student developed awareness of intermodal relations and metafunctions of sign systems in a non-linear way. The findings contribute valuable insights into understanding L2 learners’ development of metalanguage for multimodal composing.",0,1
"Abstract How do people define ethnicity and its membership? Primordialists argue that people group themselves using “primal” or permanent characteristics like physical similarity or a common language, religion, or history. Social mobilizationists, however, see ethnicity as more situational social phenomena, as an informal organization whereby people group themselves in order to strengthen their political power, especially under conditions of class and stratification. Although these approaches seem incommensurate, I argue that for “minority” populations, both perspectives are valid. In other words, both the ethnic image that mainstream society holds and ethnic identity of the minority groups themselves influence the formation of ethnic categories and their memberships. I will show how the perspective of Vantage Theory can elucidate much that is often overlooked in the study of ethnicity. In this paper I look at how Japanese Brazilians, Japanese Brazilian dekasegi returnees, and Okinawans form their notions of ethnicity. In particular, this paper explores the lexical semantics of the terms: Nihon-jin , Nihon no hito , returnee , Japones , Brasirelo / a , dekasegi , Yamato-nchu , and Uchinaa-nchu to extract the meaning and the understandings held by members of these various groups in their socially-embedded contexts, using the formal mechanisms of Vantage Theory. In all three cases, as Vantage Theory explains how various properties become more-emphasized and less-emphasized, we can better understand the dynamics of ethnic category construction and the way they are used by participants. That is, by both (1) examining what formal linguistic and lexical vantages are constructed by members of these groups and finding what the entailments ensure, and (2) exploring the less formal social vantages and perspectives held – and under what contexts – we can offer not only a more robust ethnographic and linguistic analysis, but one that is more theoretically sound as well.",0,1
"Jawi is the orthography in which Malay has been written since the Middle Ages, when it was adapted from the Arabic script. Introduced by Muslim traders, it was adapted to Malay phonology using diacritics that modified six letters. It was used until the Roman script (Rumi) brought in by European traders and colonisers began to supplant it in the nineteenth century. In spite of that, Jawi still appears in the linguistic landscape of Malaysia, Brunei, Indonesia and Pattani (Thailand). For this article snapshots have been taken of different shop signs using Jawi in Kuala Lumpur, Malacca and Kota Bharu (Malaysia). After an introduction to the structure and use of Jawi and the multilingual and ‘multiscriptal’ linguistic landscape in Malaysia, the significance of Jawi in the Malay Archipelago and its mainly symbolic use in the linguistic landscape are discussed. To complement the analysis, a quantitative survey carried out among a sample of Malaysian undergraduate students and a qualitative one among a small sample of teachers and lecturers in one Malaysian university on their attitudes towards the use of Jawi are also discussed. The article closes with some considerations and suggestions for the possible revival of Jawi.",0,1

"Abstract In a celebrated experiment, Joshua Knobe showed that people are much more prone to attribute intentionality to an agent for a side effect of a given act when that side effect is harmful than when it is beneficial. This asymmetry has become known as ‘the Knobe Effect’. According to Knobe's Moral Valence Explanation (as we call it), bad effects trigger the attributions of intentionality, whereas good effects do not. Many others believe that the Knobe Effect is best explained in terms of the high amount of blame attributed in the harm condition, and the low amount of praise attributed in the help condition. This Blame Hypothesis (as we call it) explains the high number of intentionality attributions in the harm condition in terms of the high degree of blame people ascribe, and the low number of intentionality attributions in the help conditions in terms of the low degree of praise people attribute. We replicated Knobe's original experiment and conducted a logistic regression on the results to probe more deeply into the relationship between attributions of intentionality and responsibility. The statistical analysis revealed a hitherto unknown interaction effect: intentionality correlates with blame, but not with praise. This interaction effect is consistent with the Moral Valence Hypothesis, but inconsistent with the Blame Hypothesis, as well as with two of the three other hypotheses discussed here.",0,1

Challenges for the Afrikaans lexicographer with regard to Dutch lemmata in a Dutch-Afrikaans Translation Dictionary
Voor Pampus liggen has acquired a metaphorical meaning and idiomatic status in Dutch, but is generally unknown to the Afrikaans lexicographer outside the Dutch context. For the Afrikaans lexicographer with his unique frame of reference and cultural and social value judgements, it becomes clear only in a Dutch milieu why the lexicographical editing of Dutch lemmata in a Dutch-Afrikaans translation dictionary is such a big challenge, despite the fact that the two languages are so closely related. Language interference and influence occur more readily between closely related languages. Language relativity implies that each of the languages concerned gives a unique perspective on its own reality, because of a unique life- and world-view which form an inherent part of a particular mother tongue. Important metalexicographic guidelines include the judicious application of pragmatic signals (e.g. labels), well-chosen clarificatory citations and made-up examples and relevant guidance as to usage. This can give the target user of such a dictionary an insight into the unique and culture-specific lexical elements which distinguish the two languages from each other.",0,1
"Reviewed by: Dialect leveling in Haloze, Slovenia by Grant H. Lundberg Mijo Lončarić Grant H. Lundberg. Dialect leveling in Haloze, Slovenia. Maribor: Mednarodna založba Oddelka za slovanske jezike in književnosti, Filozofska fakulteta, 2013. 114pp. [Zora, 91.] In my description of Kajkavian dialects (the Northwestern group of Croatian dialects bordering on Slovenia; Lončarić 1996), I skipped over their relationship with Haloze, giving it less attention than other segments. This was because recent works on Haloze and on the neighboring Croatian Kajkavian dialects were lacking, as Zorko (1998) and Lundberg point out. There were basic reliable data for the Slovenian side but insufficient data on the Croatian side. After Zorko’s good overview and Lundberg’s good preliminary studies (1999, 2005a, 2005b), we now have this excellent monograph on the Haloze dialect or Haloze group. Unfortunately, we do not yet have a corresponding work for the Croatian area which would give us a full picture of this part of Slovenian-Croatian linguistic relations.1 Lundberg’s monograph is dialectological and sociolinguistic. It considers the development of the system and its genesis from the reconstructed Slovenian and Croatian initial system in this area and explains the present state of the Haloze dialect group as a convergence of neighboring local dialects and the standard language. For particular periods of development he draws parallels with historical and political-territorial events on the border between the Austrian and Hungarian parts of the empire. I will look mainly at dialectological questions, particularly from the Croatian point of view. The monograph has three large thematic chapters: chapter 2, Haloze Dialects, Meje and Belavšek; chapter 3, Historical Developments; chapter 4, Dialect Leveling in Haloze; along with the Introduction and Conclusion. [End Page 147] In keeping with the considerations above, I will speak more about the dialectological, genetic side of the question. Lundberg states that in this small area, as in all of Slovenia (and it is the same in the neighboring Croatian Zagorje), we have very extensive diversification of larger idioms, from macrodialects (dialect groups) down through bases, i.e., groups of local dialects to single local dialects, which are often quite different from each other. Lundberg notes, as does Zorko, that Ramovš (1935) assigned Haloze to the Pannonian basis, while Rigler (1986) indicated a Styrian development. These opinions need not be contradictory and exclude one another since, as Lundberg shows, even in such a small space as Haloze there was an isogloss separating two developments, one Pannonian in the East and the other Styrian in the West, and perhaps in the center as well. The area was transitional, which is a normal situation even in the dialect continuum of a single language, and particularly so in border zones between closely related languages. Concentrating on Eastern Haloze, Lundberg did a detailed study of the locality Meje (in his first research Gorenjski Vrh), and for central Haloze he took Belavšek (as in his earlier work). Ramovš overlooked certain vowel phenomena, important for the development of this group, at the meeting point of Styrian, Pannonian-Slovenian, and Kajkavian; Lundberg brings them out, and they clearly show the development of the vocalism. In prosody there is a quantity opposition (long—short) only in accented syllables; the place of accent is free. It is diachronically important that there is no lengthening of a short syllable (vowel) in a non-final syllable as there is in most Slovenian dialects, although not in Kajkavian. Lundberg uses the Slovenian term brata-lengthening, which is imprecise, since most Slovenian dialects lengthen every non-final short syllable, and not only the type that has come from an old, proto-Slavic long acute, a type that is lengthened in some Croatian (not only Kajkavian) dialects as well. In Central Haloze the suprasegmental system is the same as in Eastern Haloze, but there is a difference in vocalism: in Eastern Haloze it is monophthongal without regard to the quantity, whereas in Central Haloze the long vowels are diphthongal. Western Haloze is significantly different from Eastern and Central in prosody: the accented syllable/vowel is long. Unfortunately Lundberg does not present any Western Haloze local dialect and does not state explicitly whether the given rule...",0,1
"Abstract This article critically examines the demand that academic research should be assessed by its impact, and universities' compliance with that demand. Although the discussion centres mainly on the UK, it will have relevance to any academic context where government and/or business seek to control academics. The article begins by briefly examining the meaning of impact. It next considers the role of applied linguistics in shaping language-teaching revolutions, and suggests it was commercial and political interests which had the greatest impact. Moving on to the current wider scope of applied linguistics, it suggests that while the discipline has had positive influence in some areas, it has failed to influence government policy, but that this failure is not a measure of its worth. In the second part of the article, the focus changes to a consideration of impacts on applied linguistics by public relations (PR) models of language, and government interference in academic affairs. It notes the growth and power of PR units within British universities, and wonders why applied linguistics fails to challenge the vapid and often incorrect assertions made by these communication ‘experts’ about language use. It links this ‘PR turn’ in universities, and the vague language which surrounds it, to the tightening stranglehold of current and recent UK governments on university activity, comparing this briefly to the more open recruitment of applied linguistics to serve national security interests in the USA. The overall conclusions of the article are that impact is not necessarily a measure of academic worth, and that informed critique of establishment values should remain one of the main roles of academics. While these conclusions are relevant to all academic disciplines they are of particular poignancy for applied linguistics, given the role of language in establishing control and undermining academic freedoms.",0,1

To achieve these goals, the enquiry collects and analyses over 90,000 posts on Instagram from three sites in Dublin, Ireland, between 2019 and 2021, using a set of established computational approaches from the field of natural language processing as well as diversity indices from ecology. The results picture a dynamic mechanism of the virtual linguistic landscape in Dublin over the COVID-19 pandemic, in which linguistic richness and diversity were revealed. This richness and diversity, according to our analysis, were beset by the pandemic associated with a decrease in online activities at the research sites.",0,1

"Previous research has established that readers’ eye movements are sensitive to the difficulty with which a word is processed. One important factor that influences processing is the fit of a word within the wider context, including its plausibility. Here we explore the influence of plausibility in counterfactual language processing. Counterfactuals describe hypothetical versions of the world but are grounded in the implication that the described events are not true. We report an eye-tracking study that examined the processing of counterfactual premises that varied the plausibility of a described action and manipulated the narrative perspective (“you” vs. “he/she”). Results revealed a comparable pattern to previous plausibility experiments. Readers were sensitive to the inconsistent thematic relation in anomalous and implausible conditions. The fact that these anomaly detection effects were evident within a counterfactual frame suggests that participants were evaluating incoming information within the counterfactual world and did not suspend processing based on an inference about reality. Interestingly, perspective modulated the speed with which anomalous but not implausible words were detected.",0,1

"In recent years, interest in learning Korean as an additional language (KAL) has rapidly grown among Iranian youths and women. This study adopted a mixed-methods QUAN → qual design to examine Iranian learners’ motivation for and experience in learning KAL. For this purpose, 174 Iranian learners of Korean were requested to complete a motivation questionnaire, and semi-structured interviews were subsequently conducted with nine of these participants. The results indicated that the participants pursued KAL learning more in terms of the Ideal Self, meaning that they found KAL learning as an opportunity to realise their internalised aspirations and ideals, which were primarily integrative and, to a lesser extent, instrumental. It was also found that the female participants were driven by stronger motivational intensity to learn Korean. The results of the qualitative data analysis corroborated those of the quantitative data analysis regarding the participants’ self-guides in learning KAL. The qualitative results also showed that the interviewees had a positive experience of learning Korean in the classroom, though this positive experience seemed to overshadow concerns over learning priorities and outcomes.",0,1

"Noun referents can be substituted by personal pronouns. In most contexts the pronoun is coreferent to and interchangeable with the noun it refers to. Other pronouns modify nouns; some have the capability of doing both. In English, the personal pronouns substitute, the articles modify, and the demonstratives do both. Locatives, interrogatives, relatives, indefinite, and negative forms are included among the pronouns. In personal pronouns sets are distinguished by person, number, and gender. Some are used for honorifics or have other special uses. Non-personal pronouns are demonstratives, articles, indefinite, negative, interrogative, and relative forms. There are also pronominally used adverbs and nouns. In noun phrases and clauses they may be marked for case distinctions. Subject pronouns in particular may also be fused with aspect and mode markers, which are verbal categories. There are different forms for degrees of emphasis. In the genitive case the possessive pronouns mark the possessor, with agreement to the possessor or the possessed item, or both. Pronouns may also substitute the whole possessive noun phrase. Reflexives are quite different from all the others by the fact that they neither modify nor substitute. They are coreferent with nouns but not interchangeable with them. The same is true for logophoric pronouns, which refer to the speaker in a reported speech situation. Sequential pronouns refer to the subject of a matrix clause, which may be the same or different in a subordinated clause. Since they may have other similarities with the pronouns they are presented under this general heading also.",0,1

"We outline three challenges involved in designing external representations that promote sustainable use of natural resources. First, the task environment of sustainable resource-use is highly unstructured, and involves many uncoordinated and asynchronous actions. Following from this complex nature of the task environment, more task constraints and task interactions are involved in designing representations promoting sustainability, compared to representations that seek to make tasks easier in structured task environments, such as aircraft cockpits and control rooms. Second, external representations promoting sustainable resource-use need to motivate people to make decisions that sustain resources, and persist with this behavior, even though alternate behaviors are easier and commonplace. Third, external representations promoting sustainability also need to lower the cognitive load involved in sustainability decisions. This three-tiered function (meeting complex task constraints, providing motivation, lowering cognitive load) makes such representations challenging to design. However, some early prototype designs promoting sustainable resource-use have appeared recently, primarily addressing electricity use. Analyzing these digital prototypes, we outline three design principles they share, and show how these seek to address the complexities of the sustainability problem-space (complexity of task environments, goals, and representations). We then argue that at least two further cognitive scaffolds are required for effectively promoting sustainable resource use (action scripts, deconstruction). We close with some of the limitations of this approach to promoting sustainability, and outline future work.",0,1
"Writing was invented too recently to have influenced the human genome. Consequently, reading acquisition must rely on partial recycling of pre-existing brain systems. Prior fMRI evidence showed that in literates a left-hemispheric visual region increases its activation to written strings relative to illiterates and reduces its response to faces. Increasing literacy also leads to a stronger right-hemispheric lateralization for faces. Here, we evaluated whether this reorganization of the brain's face system has behavioral consequences for the processing of non-linguistic visual stimuli. Three groups of adult illiterates, ex-illiterates and literates were tested with the sequential composite face paradigm that evaluates the automaticity with which faces are processed as wholes. Illiterates were consistently more holistic than participants with reading experience in dealing with faces. A second experiment replicated this effect with both faces and houses. Brain reorganization induced by literacy seems to reduce the influence of automatic holistic processing of faces and houses by enabling the use of a more analytic and flexible processing strategy, at least when holistic processing is detrimental to the task.",0,1

"In Standard Yorùbá, syntax affects the tone of both lexical and functional heads in different ways.

"AbstractIn 1790, the American government ratified the first official census of the nation’s population. Since then, the US Census has been taken continuously every ten years and has become indispensable for the equitable distribution of rights and resources. Nevertheless, the Census has not escaped criticism. In particular, its system of ethnoracial nomenclature is regularly attacked for failing to adequately reflect the nation’s changing demography and linguistic sensibilities. Consequently, many critics have called for the introduction of new terminology. The present investigation examines some of the most popular names suggested for one group in particular: US American Residents of Muslim, Middle Eastern and/or Arab descent (AROMMEA). The four racial ethnonyms examined are Arab-American; Middle Easterner/Middle-East American; Muslim-American; and White.1 As this investigation demonstrates, each of these names comes with its own unique set of linguistic, social, and political advantages and disadvantages.",0,1
"Enggano, spoken on an island of the same name off the southern coast of Sumatra, Indonesia, has long puzzled historical linguists. Its high rate of lexical replacement and sometimes-obscure reflexes of reconstructed Proto-Malayo-Polynesian vocabulary have led many to question its status as an Austronesian language. Recent work on Enggano historical phonology and subgrouping has formed a strong argument for its inclusion in Malayo-Polynesian, but certain aspects of its historical phonology remain a mystery. This paper is concerned with word-level nasality, an innovation in Enggano that remains unexplained and has been described as an unconditioned split. The paper begins with the hypothesis that word-level nasality in Enggano spread from sonorant codas that first merged as nasals, then deleted. The only major condition on this change is that sonorant codas in syllables with a schwa nucleus did not trigger nasalization. Finally, the paper investigates several cases where, because of the large number of mergers in Enggano, the modern Enggano words cannot be unambiguously assigned to only one of multiple possible reconstructed words. The result is a hypothesis that can accurately explain the majority of cases of word-level nasality in Enggano, but with four exceptions where nasality is present with no apparent historical trigger. These four exceptions prevent a confident defense of the present hypothesis but may hold clues to Enggano's turbulent recent history and irregular intergenerational transmission due to a dramatic loss in the Enggano population.",0,1

"We consider here Goffman's proposal of proportionality between virtual offenses and remedial actions, based on the examination of 102 cases of explicit apologies. To this end, we offer a typology of the primary apology formats within the dataset, together with a broad categorization of the types of virtual offenses to which these apologies are addressed. We find a broad proportionality between apologies and the offenses they remediate when the offenses to be remediated are minor; however, this relationship is not sustained among larger apologies and offenses. In the latter cases, relational and contextual contingencies are important intervening factors influencing apology construction.",0,1
"In this study, formant tracking is investigated by refining the formants tracked by an existing data-driven tracker, DeepFormants, using the formants estimated in a model-driven manner by linear prediction (LP)-based methods. As LP-based formant estimation methods, conventional covariance analysis (LP-COV) and the recently proposed quasi-closed phase forward–backward (QCP-FB) analysis are used. In the proposed refinement approach, the contours of the three lowest formants are first predicted by the data-driven DeepFormants tracker, and the predicted formants are replaced frame-wise with local spectral peaks shown by the model-driven LP-based methods. The refinement procedure can be plugged into the DeepFormants tracker with no need for any new data learning. Two refined DeepFormants trackers were compared with the original DeepFormants and with five known traditional trackers using the popular vocal tract resonance (VTR) corpus. The results indicated that the data-driven DeepFormants trackers outperformed the conventional trackers and that the best performance was obtained by refining the formants predicted by DeepFormants using QCP-FB analysis. In addition, by tracking formants using VTR speech that was corrupted by additive noise, the study showed that the refined DeepFormants trackers were more resilient to noise than the reference trackers. In general, these results suggest that LP-based model-driven approaches, which have traditionally been used in formant estimation, can be combined with a modern data-driven tracker easily with no further training to improve the tracker’s performance.",0,1

The frequency of such performance/competence nicknames correlates positively with those tasks which involve risk and in which the consequences of inappropriate behavior are greatest.

"In this paper we test the hypothesis that tautologies (An X is an X; X is X) are actually not tautologies (i.e., not repetitive). Indeed, when exploring natural language use, it seems that, having expressed such “uninformative” statements, speakers, most often, spell out their specific intended interpretation, rendering these messages informative (Section 2). Visual/pictorial tautologies are also informative; either they allow the observers to come up with their own interpretation, or often, the artists use language to spell out the intended message (Section 3). Whether in language or in picture, artists tend to deautomatize the familiar, thereby rendering tautologies Optimally Innovative. Additionally, they often produce tautologies that convey figurative messages, whether metaphorical or sarcastic, thus allowing these tautologies to be highly creative (Section 5). Tautologies, then, communicate innovative messages, even when implicitly so. In fact, tautologies may often covertly reject the default salient meaning, while explicitly enlarging on it by using a novel, nondefault alternative.",0,1
"87 A Correction on Grep To the Editor: In Dictionaries (2007) in Kleinedler's review of The Official Dictionary of UnoffidalEnglish, you added an editorial note defining the term grep as 'a means of sorting on strings in Unix.' That is wrong. Grep is an acronym for Global RegularExpression Print and it searches; it does not sort. To understand what grep does (because it is a computer program that causes an action), think of a river flowing past a man standing at the shore picking out things of interest and putting them on the side. That's what grep does: you give it a pattern of a certain type and it catches all occurrences of that pattern in a file of text as the text flows by. So, if I give the Unix command grep chocolate recipes.txt, the file recipes.txt will be examined and all lines of text containing the word chocolate will be printed; other lines will be ignored. Sorry to be pedantic, but in computer science there is a world of difference between sorting a file and searching a file. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep for lots more information.

"Introduction: Clinical education is essential in training future speech-language pathologists and developing the profession. To date, there is limited information about clinical education in Malaysia. The aim of this study was to describe the experience of speech-language pathology clinical educators in Malaysia when providing clinical education, and to obtain their views on innovative models of clinical education that can be applied in Malaysia.Method: Ten speech-language pathology clinical educators were involved in semi-structured individual interviews for this study. Qualitative content analysis was used to analyse interview data. Following analysis, two themes were identified which were strategies used and challenges faced by clinical educators when providing clinical education. In terms of the implementation of innovative models of clinical education, a majority of participants showed a preference for the block placement and mentoring models.Results: Findings from this study provide an insight to the challenges faced by clinical educators in Malaysia, and how these challenges are similar and different from those faced elsewhere in the world. Participants opinions on innovative models of clinical education will allow universities in Malaysia to employ these models to meet the increasing needs of placements and overcome some of the other challenges faced by clinical educators.",0,1

"This study examined the use of personal (exclusive first-person plural pronouns) and impersonal (abstract rhetors, periphrastic passives and it-clauses) authorial references in a corpus of 160 research articles in applied linguistics, psychology, environmental engineering and chemistry. The aim was to see if personal and impersonal authorial references, as realized by the rhetorical options chosen, are predisposed to differences across disciplinary rhetorical cultures. The results indicated disciplinary variations in both the frequency and use of personal and impersonal authorial references, especially when the disciplines were compared for contrasting effects. While the applied linguistics and psychology writers favoured the use of exclusive first-person plural pronouns to construct their authorial persona, the environmental engineering and chemistry writers preferred a more detached interpersonal style by opting predominantly for periphrastic passives. Also, the results showed differences in the incidence of use of personal and impersonal authorial references across discourse functions, which could be attributed to the adoption of different interpersonal strategies within the disciplines. The present results are expected to extend our understanding of disciplinary variations towards the use of authorial references in tandem with discourse functions in research articles in the selected disciplines, particularly in the relatively unexplored disciplines of chemistry and environmental engineering.",0,1

"41? LANGUAGE, VOLUME 74, NUMBER 2 (1998) Ch. 5, 'Dialect and standard in speakers' perceptions ' (101-17), discusses informants' reactions to recorded speech. Tape recordings of four different speakers were played, and the informants were then asked which of the four speakers spoke like people in Neckarau. The recordings contained a variety of prominent features of Mannheim/Neckarau dialect, including apocope of final schwa, unrounding of [y] to [i], and spirantization of medial and final [g] following back vowels, among others. In addition, some of the informants' comments about the recorded dialect samples are given here. The sixth chapter, 'Linguistic usage in the interview situation' (1 18-61). deals with the informants' linguistic usage. The first part addresses the informants ' 'alleged' usage, i e. what the informants think that they say. The second section analyzes their actual usage. The final section discusses the notion of slang (Umgangssprache). The final chapter, 'Conclusion' (162-65) briefly summarizes some of the main points of D's study. There are also several appendices, including brief biographies of the informants, comments on 'typical' Neckarau dialect, a copy of the questionnaire given to informants, and transcripts of the test speakers' and informants' speech samples [Marc Pierce, University ofMichigan.] Verb i passiv fulgt av perfektum parcitisipp : Bruk og historic By Jan Engh. Oslo: Novus Forlag, 1994. Pp. 374. NCr 285.00. This book investigates the history and usage of the past participle when preceded by a passive verb in Norwegian. It builds on Engh's paper of 1 977, a preliminary sketch of the structure of this passive construction , which E calls the AO construction. The book is divided into three main parts and appendices (309-74) which cover lists ofmaterial, possible verbs in Old and Middle Norwegian, and other matters. Part lisa description of the different AO constructions in Modern Norwegian. E analyzes these constructions in traditional syntax and sets up an informal semantic classification of the AO construction and its two verbs (the past participle and the passive verb). AO constructions are basically of two sorts (1) sentences with a free predicate such as (1-1) Planen fors0kes iverksat (The plan tries to be realized', i.e. we try to carry out the plan), which refer to a future state of affairs, and (2) sentences with a stable predicate such as (1-4) Leilighet selges m0blert (""The apartment sells furnished', i.e. Furnished apartment for sale) and (1-5) Mannskapet fryktes omkommet (The crew is feared lost'), which depict present states of affairs. Within the two mam groups, the AO construction can possess other syntactic and semantic structures, e.g. sentence (1-4) has a past participle which is derived from a transitive verb whereas ( 1 -5) has a participle derived from an intransitive verb. Furthermore, E defines a range of constructions which seem identical to the AO construction but which are unacceptable AO sentences, e.g. Leilighet selges m0blert i forrige uge (The apartment sells furnished last week'), where the time adverbial disqualifies the sentence. The second part centers on the comparison of semantic and morphosyntactic features in the AO construction of older Danish-Norwegian, Old and Middle Norwegian, and Modern Norwegian. E concludes that the AO construction is not a new construction in Norwegian; it appears as part of the infinitive system of Old Norse and Old Norwegian. In Part III E considers the origin of the AO in Latin and German. He also considers whether the AO could have been based on Norwegian or Scandinavian. In addition, he discusses the development of the AO construction from Old and Middle Norwegian to today and the connection to similar constructions m other languages. The AO construction does not originate from Latin, but probably from the AO construction in Old and Middle English (e.g. Hit wasfounyn ywritte in oon stone) and from an older Nordic predicative construction. Verbs without the required syntactic features, but with other semantic features, might have replaced the predicative, leading to an AO construction. The book offers a thorough and comprehensive treatment of a neglected aspect of Norwegian It will be of primary interest to those seeking philological evidence for the change in the use of the past participle preceded...",0,1
"In this work, we report large-scale semantic role annotation of arguments in the Turkish dependency treebank, and present the first comprehensive Turkish semantic role labeling (SRL) resource: Turkish Proposition Bank (PropBank). We present our annotation workflow that harnesses crowd intelligence, and discuss the procedures for ensuring annotation consistency and quality control. Our discussion focuses on syntactic variations in realization of predicate-argument structures, and the large lexicon problem caused by complex derivational morphology. We describe our approach that exploits framesets of root verbs to abstract away from syntax and increase self-consistency of the Turkish PropBank. The issues that arise in the annotation of verbs derived via valency changing morphemes, verbal nominals, and nominal verbs are explored, and evaluation results for inter-annotator agreement are provided. Furthermore, semantic layer described here is aligned with universal dependency (UD) compliant treebank and released to enable more researchers to work on the problem. Finally, we use PropBank to establish a baseline score of 79.10 F1 for Turkish SRL using the mate-tool (an open-source SRL tool based on supervised machine learning) enhanced with basic morphological features. Turkish PropBank and the extended SRL system are made publicly available.",0,1

Experiment 1 verified the prediction that the perception of sarcasm increases with an increase in the size of situational disparity. Experiment 2 investigated the relation between situational disparity and another cue to speakers' sarcastic intentions, echoic mention. The experiment found additive effects of the magnitude of situational disparity and the memory cueing capability of the utterance, suggesting that the factors make independent contributions to the perception of sarcasm.",0,1

"Previous psycholinguistic studies have suggested that English and Spanish express temporal duration through different metaphors. English tends to use the time-as-length metaphor (e.g. I have been waiting for a long time), while Spanish prefers the time-as-quantity metaphor (e.g. he esperado mucho tiempo; ‘I have waited much time’). However, these results conflated two different construals: the temporal duration construal, which can use length or quantity metaphors, (e.g. long time, that didn’t last much time) and the time-as-a-resource construal, which mostly employs quantity metaphors (e.g. you spent too much time). This study confirms through corpus linguistic data that English favors the time-as-length metaphor when expressing temporal duration, while it favors the time-as-quantity metaphor when expressing the time-as-a-resource construal. On the other hand, Spanish employs the time-as-quantity metaphor both in the duration and the resource construal. In addition, English shows a higher frequency of time-as-resource expressions, while Spanish shows a higher frequency of duration metaphors. This difference might be explained by the fact that English has been classified as a monochronic culture, conceptualizing time as a valuable object, while Spanish is a polychronic culture, categorizing time in a more abstract and flexible way.",0,1
"SANG YEE CHEON is Assistant Professor of Korean Linguistics in the Department of East Asian Languages and Literatures at the University of Hawai'i at Mānoa.Also, it is important for teachers to know how to use film to make connections. Creating connections with film in the foreign language classroom is not a new or innovative approach anymore. Nowadays, even science teachers understand the interdependence of science and literacy. Science teachers in secondary education in the United States have been combining science and language in their classrooms, which are already successfully implemented. Depending on the needs of students who are at different proficiency levels and who are immersed in diverse disciplinary knowledge (i.e., varying majors), teachers should choose appropriate film(s) to teach both content (or different disciplines) and language. In a pilot survey study, Cheon (2014) found that after taking a Korean film course, students rated the ACTFL (American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages) National Standard goal Connection higher in overall importance than the other four Cs (i.e., Communication, Comparisons, Communities, and Cultures), though their rating of the Cultures goal was still quite high. The “Connection” survey question from the Korean film course helped me reinforce knowledge of my own and other disciplines. Language instruction through film or video materials can strengthen or reinforce students' intellectual growth and foreign language improvement.Let me give you a few reasons why the film JSA is a good choice for a Korean language class. First, the film's cast was well chosen and its plot was well designed to illustrate NK and SK relations. The plot helps viewers take a small first step toward imagining both Koreas bonding together. For this reason, the film was the top box office hit of 2000, and still remains one of the most popular and well made popular films in Korean cinema. Second, the film is a good resource to deal with contemporary Korean history and society. For instance, in addition to the film itself, themes to be taken out of the film are (1) the ax-murder incident at the demilitarized zone and its aftermath, (2) Korean anticommunism education, (3) National Security Law, (4) military power in South Korea, North Korea, and the USA, (5) the Korean War, (6) family dispersal due to the Korean War, (7) Korea-US alliance, and (8) reunification. Those themes have been vital and pending issues in Korea for the past 60 years, and it is difficult to understand Korean society without knowing these issues.As I mentioned earlier, film can be a good source to teach both lower proficiency students and higher proficiency students depending on the film. Films that I have used so far are My Heart (1999), Spy Lee (1999), Peppermint Candy (2000), JSA (2000), The President's Barber (2004), Marathon (2005), Castaway on the Moon (2009), and If You Were Me 5 (2011). The four films Spy Lee (1999), Peppermint Candy (2000), JSA (2000), and The President's Barber (2004) are appropriate to advanced learners of Korean for the teaching of contemporary Korean history since the Korean War. In addition to JSA (2000), which deals with NK and SK relations, The President's Barber (2004), directed by Chan-sang Lim, also depicts Korean political history and society in the 1960s–1970s through the eyes of one president's barber. Likewise, Peppermint Candy (2000), directed by Chang-dong Lee, reflects the contemporary history of Korea through the life of an ordinary middle-aged Korean man over a period of twenty years. The man had lived through various historical catastrophes, from the 1980s to the economic crisis of the late 1990s.On the other hand, some films are appropriate for teaching Korean society or cultural values. For instance, My Heart (1999), directed by Chang-ho Lee, reflects how differently Korean women experience life than men, including social and economic change in the modernization process. The film is good for addressing changing gender roles or women's problems. Castaway on the Moon (2009) directed by Hae-jun Lee is a good film for dealing with social issues such as credit card debtors, suicide, bullying, shut-in or lookism. If You Were Me 5 (2011) is the fifth omnibus film commissioned by the National Human Rights Commission of Korea, consisting of five short films. The themes include human rights issues such as sexual assault, rape victims, NK defectors, foreign workers, cyber privacy, abortion, and social discrimination. “Language teaching is possible without culture. However, it may not be possible to go into deeper, more extended language learning without culture. Culture learning encompasses language learning and includes a great deal more than what happens intentionally or not in the classroom … Language learning is the starting point and the focus but culture learning is the aim” (Swiderski, 1993, p. 9). All of these movies that I mention are good sources for higher proficiency students. In a study of the effects of a CBI curriculum on Korean language use of heritage students in class, Kim (2005) also found that students were satisfied with the CBI curriculum, expressing a positive reaction to the topics as they increased students' understanding of and insight into Korean social and cultural issues.I would like to introduce a film for lower proficiency students. The film Marathon (2005) directed by Yoon-cheol Jeong is based on the real story about an autistic child who tried to compete in a marathon. The film is appealing to language learners because the characters in the film use simple language, and its story is also touching. Lower proficiency students have different needs. They typically wish to learn language and culture in order to improve their Korean proficiency levels and to deepen their knowledge of Korean culture, trying to understand what they watch, instead of figuring out or researching informative, heavy, and complex issues.The courses are also designed for helping students develop critical thinking skills. When instructors develop a content course, they should take into consideration developing students' creative, intellectual or rational thinking because it is necessary in order to improve speaking and writing skills. Regarding quality of instruction reflected in the student evaluations, students in the courses wrote, “The class was a fun class despite the heavy workload” and “The class gave me critical thinking skills to assess movies instead of just watching them. Now I enjoy movies on a different level.” Instructors do not teach students how to talk like parrots. They should not only teach content, but also develop students' logical thinking, giving opinions or building up their hypothesis. Critical thinking skills are one of the integral keys that unlock the door to academic success for students.Basically, all films are fictional and some films cover fictionalized history, even though documentary films are non-fictional. Films do not accurately reflect history as it is. Instructors need to let students know about the mismatch between historical fact and fictionalized history. It is the students' job to understand and interpret what messages directors try to convey through films.For lower or intermediate proficiency students, English translation was preceded by each Korean language text in the textbook I developed. At the end of each semester, I conducted a post-survey where each question was rated on a 5-point Likert scale. The results revealed that both heritage and non-heritage students thought that the English translation helped them understand what we had covered in class (non-heritage learners, 4.6/5, vs. heritage learners, 4/5).Foreign films help students to become exposed to the authentic or natural target language and also to all aspects of real life usage of the language. Some instructors or students may think that English subtitles are not necessary while watching films in class because sometimes subtitles can be distracting or make students lazy learners. In a pilot survey study, however, Cheon (2014) found that English subtitles were highly recommended by all heritage and non-heritage learners of Korean to ensure fuller comprehension of the Korean films that they watched in class. (In an experimental study of the influence of subtitles on second language acquisition for Norwegian learners of English, Kvitnes [2013] found after comparison with the control group without subtitles that subtitles helped learners' comprehension of the plot of a 20-minute video clip, which was tested immediately after the video screening.) Also, I let students read English subtitles to ensure fuller comprehension of the Korean films when they watched in class. In the post-survey, most students preferred English subtitles (non-heritage learners, 4.8/5, vs. heritage learners, 4/5) regardless of their Korean proficiency level.One of the suggestions I would give to language teachers is that it is really helpful to make selected film clips to cover the content or filmic text. In many cases it is not easy to find the right scene or segment from the DVD every time one needs to during the class period. Short video clips from films in the target language should be created for the effective use of class time by using Windows Movie Maker software. If digital video files are not available for editing, numerous videos from Youtube or the Internet are also available for classroom use. With the development of computer-based technologies and the Internet, authentic materials are available at any time. Teachers can have simpler and easier sequences of video clips edited from film and manipulate the video clips with different speeds (depending on student proficiency). If teachers use the technology effectively and if students take advantage of these rich resources to enhance their language learning, improvement of students' language skills is possible.Another important suggestion is that in the case of authentic video or film use in class without English subtitles, language teachers need to prepare pre-viewing vocabulary activities or short film introduction for lower proficiency students, which allows students of all levels to understand the film context and filmic text. Sometimes, watching films without appropriate pre-viewing activities can cause a higher degree of anxiety or frustration and end up de-motivating the students. Let me give you one example of a pre-viewing vocabulary activity. First, language teachers need to create and provide a list of important and key vocabulary from the film text, and let students study on their own or submit a vocabulary list with sentences (by creating one or two sentences for each word) and to take a short writing vocabulary test in class (a one-paragraph long essay using the words from the list). The primary purpose of this activity is to help students individually learn and understand each film completely and expand their vocabulary related to the film within a short period of time.The concept of “Connections” has become a significant element in language classrooms. How can we, as teachers of language and culture, foster the process of making connections? For example: Students making connections between themselves, their lives, their experiences and the pieces selected for class. Students making connections between films and literary pieces in the target language/culture and films/literary pieces in other languages/cultures that they know and are familiar with. Connections between the literary/cinematic pieces and other disciplines, such as fine arts, history, sociology, geography, music, science, and engineering.Students were able to make connections between films and history (or culture/literature/politics/science and even engineering) because common topics drawn from films can be contemporary socio-cultural issues (such as the Korean Wave, changing gender roles in Korea, and multi-cultural society in Korea), Korean history, political issues between North Korea and South Korea, and international relations, human rights such as NK defectors or foreign workers, women writers, environmental contamination, human cloning, and so forth.",0,1
"This article focuses on the acquisition of mood in early complement clauses of European Portuguese (EP). Two semantic features are involved in the EP mood system—epistemicity and veridicality. An elicited production task administered to 80 children aged 4 to 9 showed that, even though children use the subjunctive in [– epistemic] contexts, the selection of a subjunctive complement is especially troublesome under [+ epistemic; – veridical] predicates. A corpus analysis, meant to characterize the input to which children are exposed, showed that this pattern of mood distribution is not entirely explained by verb frequency or by mood variability in the input. We argue that children go through a stage in which they are not able to map mood morphology to the required sum of features and give priority to epistemicity only. Thus, while in early stages the [+/– epistemic] contrast influences mood choices, the [+/– veridic] contrast (particularly in epistemic contexts) does not. Despite that, we provide new evidence that children rely on the relevant semantic features throughout the process of mood acquisition.",0,1

"La multiplicité des emplois directs ou dérivés du terme médiation est un signe du flou qui entoure ce concept, sa prise en compte se réduisant souvent à l'analyse de ses implications méthodologiques et technologiques. Or la médiation est un concept cognitif qui ne prend tout son sens que dans le cadre socio-constructiviste. Elle suppose avant tout un étayage social ainsi qu'un processus de contrôle et de re-médiation par le biais du langage, et vise la valorisation des capacités de l'apprenant et, à terme, son autonomisation. Dans le cadre de l'approche communicative cependant, on l'assimile trop souvent aux concepts d'interaction et de communication, confondant ainsi l'objectif instrumental de l'apprentissage et le cadre cognitif de son développement. Or toute interaction n'est pas cognitive. Pour qu'il en soit ainsi il faut créer, grâce à un guidage raisonné, une dynamique maïeutique susceptible de conduire l'apprenant à découvrir l'objet d'apprentissage mais aussi à comprendre et gérer ses propres processus mentaux. Entre médiation enseignante et autorégulation, il n'y a donc pas de différence de nature mais un continuum : la médiation constitue un processus complexe mais unique qu'il ne faut pas limiter aux divers supports et techniques qui lui servent d'outils.",0,1
"The long problematic correspondence of North Slavic -ě ~ South Slavic -ę in the jo-stem accusative plural and jā-stem genitive singular and nominative and accusative plural is best explained by positing a Proto-Slavic contrast within the soft jā-stems between gen. sg., nom. pl. *-ē and acc. pl. *-ę̄, which was leveled in different directions as NSl -ě and SSl -ę. With its nasal vowel, the acc. pl. ending must go back to *-jāns, thereby demonstrating that the PIE eh2-stem desinence *-eh2s > *-ās was remade to *-āns after the other declensional classes in the early prehistory of Slavic. The Baltic facts are consistent with a Proto-Balto-Slavic date for this innovation.",0,1

"In The White Company (1891) and Sir Nigel (1906), Arthur Conan Doyle reconstructed the fourteenth century and explored the culture and visions of chivalry. He created many different knights with the intention of dissecting the mind and conduct of this historical type. He was concerned with his human as well as his romantic aspect, and he addressed the conflicts the divergent obligations of external duty and personal aspirations caused. Doyle’s reflections focused on the dreadful and illusory game played by knights like Sir Nigel Loring, the most curious and significant representative of idealistic and delusional chivalry in his medieval fiction. His youth and adult age show the tensions between the two worlds whose paths he must tread. His life is a long struggle for virtue and honour, oscillating between the responsibilities of a nobleman in the days of Edward III and the Hundred Years War and the pursuit of chivalry.",0,1
"Abstract This paper presents an overview of Harmonic Grammar with gradient symbolic representations (a.k.a. Gradient Harmonic Grammar), a weighted‐constraint model of grammatical computation in which language structures are mentally represented with numerically continuous levels of activity, or degree of presence. In this system, the penalty of each constraint violation is proportional to the activity of the structure that incurs it. The adoption of gradient activity permits unique advances in generative approaches to key types of idiosyncratic patterns in language. I review the main proposals that have been made in the framework, and outstanding issues such as the existence of gradient activity in output structures.",0,1
"espanolEl objetivo del trabajo es determinar criterios para distinguir entre expresiones de obligacion con proposito prescriptivo (recomendaciones o sugerencias) y aquellas que podrian tener otras funciones. Para ello, se analizan las expresiones de obligacion en un corpus de editoriales de tres revistas cientificas de la Argentina. En el marco de los estudios de lenguas para propositos especificos y los trabajos pragmatico-semanticos sobre la estructura accional, se analiza la estructura retorica de los textos y la estructura ilocutiva de los segmentos textuales en que aparecen las expresiones de obligacion. Se observa que las expresiones de obligacion realizan dos tipos de actos de habla directivos: los prescriptivos, que proponen acciones para ser realizadas por los destinatarios, y los metadiscursivos, que tienen la funcion de destacar informacion relevante. Se observan diferencias entre ambos tipos de directivos, principalmente en relacion con la funcion en la estructura ilocutiva. Se observa que una expresion de obligacion tiene funcion prescriptiva si la ilocucion directiva es dominante en un segmento textual. En cambio, si la expresion de obligacion funciona como apoyo de una dominante asertiva, su valor prescriptivo aparece en segundo plano. El analisis de la estructura ilocutiva puede ser un criterio para establecer distinciones. EnglishThis paper aims at distinguishing between obligation expressions with prescriptive functions (recommendations and suggestions) and obligation expressions with a different function. We focus on deontic modality expressions in a corpus of three scientific journals of Argentina, drawing on studies of languages for specific purposes, and linguistic analysis of rhetorical and illocutionary patterns. We examine illocutionary patterns of rhetorical moves in which those expressions appear. We observed two types of directives: prescriptive ones, which propose activities to the audience, and metadiscursive directives, which aim at highlighting relevant information. These two directives present several differences, especially, in the illocutionary structure. Prescriptive directives constitute the main illocution in the illocutionary pattern, while metadiscursive directives constitute a supportive function. The analysis of illocutionary structure may be set as a criteria for establishing distinctions.",0,1

"The article describes the causative morphemes in four Bantu languages of group A 70 : Eton, Ewondo, Ntumu and Atsi. Synchronically, these languages have two causative morphemes : one short, consisting of a central vowel : / a / or / g /, and the other long, consisting of a central vowel and a lateral consonant : -VI- or -IV. Different diachronic hypotheses are presented to explain these forms. The most convincing explanation is the one that links these causative morphemes to morphemes reconstructed for Proto-Bantu. The short form would then be a reflex of the short causative morpheme *-i-, whereas the long form would be a reflex of the applicative suffix *-id-. Although these correspondences might appear to be rather exceptional on a phonological level, they are confirmed by similar evolutions in other morphemes. Finally, the existence of a semantic link between the applicative and the causative is not uncommon from a universal point of view.",0,1

"Reviewed by: New perspectives on case theory ed. by Ellen Brandner and Heike Zinsmeister Sergey Evtyukhin New perspectives on case theory. Ed. by Ellen Brandner and Heike Zinsmeister. (CSLI lecture notes 156.) Stanford, CA: CSLI Publications, 2003. Pp. 376. ISBN 1575863642. $27.50. Case and its role in the language system are commonly considered among the most important issues of modern generative linguistics. The current volume offers a number of analyses of various case-related phenomena in different languages within different frameworks. It is a collection of talks given at the annual meeting of the German Society for Linguistics in spring 2000. Artemis Alexiadou (‘On nominative case features and split agreement’) challenges the hypothesis that UG aligns specific cases with specific projections and proposes an analysis that unifies several properties common to DPs in Icelandic and Hebrew. She suggests that different DPs check nominative case in different projections (T as well as Aspect). The analysis also accounts for ergative case systems. Miriam Butt and Tracy Holloway King (‘Case systems: Beyond structural distinctions’) provide a unified analysis of case systems in two ergative languages, Georgian and Urdu, and argue that a division of case systems into ergative and accusative is insufficient for understanding the case system of a language. They argue that both syntactic and semantic information should be taken into account for the analysis of these two case systems and that case markers themselves have semantic content. Eric Haeberli (‘Categorial features and the source of EPP and abstract case phenomena’) proposes a motivation for the EPP and abstract case and analyzes these categories in terms of feature matrices that must interact in a clause in order to be licensed. Jóhannes Gisli Jónsson (‘Not so quirky: On subject case in Icelandic’) refines his earlier observations of subject case in Icelandic. He notes that there are semantic restrictions on nonnominative subjects in Icelandic and that two types of lexical case must be recognized. Marcus Kracht (‘Against the feature bundle theory of case’) argues against the view that case is a bundle of features and introduces a hierarchical ‘stacked’ representation of case. Diane Nelson (‘Case and event structure in Finnish psych predicates’) discusses the idea that there is a link between case and the event structure of the predicate as a whole. Halldór Ármann Sigurđsson (‘Case: Abstract vs. morphological’) argues that deep case is universal and morphological case is a PF phenomenon and that these two types of case can act independently. Ralf Vogel (‘Surface matters: Case conflict in free relative constructions and case theory’) discusses case conflicts in free relative constructions and the implications of this phenomenon for the theory. He uses an optimality-theoretic approach to derive a hierarchy of case systems. The last paper in this volume is by Ellen Woolford (‘Burzio’s generalization, markedness, and locality constraints on nominative objects’). It discusses a recent approach to Burzio’s generalization, which states that the object gets nominative case when there is no nominative subject available. The author argues that markedness plays a role here and that nominative is a less marked case. Exceptions are explained by other constraints ranked higher than case.

"Sometimes in interaction, a speaker articulates an overt interpretation of prior talk. Such moments have been studied as involving the repair of a problem with the other’s talk or as formulating an understanding of the matter at hand. Stepping back from the established notions of formulations and repair, we examine the variety of actions speakers do with the practice of offering an interpretation, and the order within this domain. Results show half a dozen usage types of interpretations in mundane interaction. These form a largely continuous territory of action, with recognizably distinct usage types as well as cases falling between these (proto)typical uses. We locate order in the domain of interpretations using the method of semantic maps and show that, contrary to earlier assumptions in the literature, interpretations that formulate an understanding of the matter at hand are actually quite pervasive in ordinary talk. These findings contribute to research on action formation and advance our understanding of understanding in interaction. Data are video- and audio-recordings of mundane social interaction in the German language from a variety of settings.",0,1

"In many Philippine, northern Sulawesi, and northern Bornean languages, Proto Austronesian *kita 'first-person inclusive plural' became a first-person inclusive dual pronoun. Robert Blust and Hsiu-chuan Liao attribute this semantic change to drift (a change happening in various related languages independently). However, Lawrence Reid contends that it had already happened in Proto Malayo-Polynesian, and that the ensuing gap in the pronominal system of this ancestral language had been filled by the formation of a new first-person inclusive plural pronoun, which was based on *kita combined with a pronominal clitic (or ""extender"") *=mu. The latter was a second-person plural pronoun in Proto Austronesian, but after it had lost its plural meaning in Proto Malayo-Polynesian, it was often combined with or replaced by other pronominal extenders.",0,1

"Abstract Generic generalisations (e.g. ‘tigers have stripes’, ‘ducks lay eggs’) refer to a characteristic property of a kind. Recently, the generics-as-default view has posited that we have a bias towards interpreting universally quantified statements as generic. Evidence offered for this view is the Generic Overgeneralisation (GOG) effect, which refers to the documented tendency of participants to misinterpret a quantificational statement like ‘all ducks lay eggs’ as if it were a generic and thus accept it as true, even though they know it is false. Across two experiments in English and Greek we systematically addressed the relevance of context and quantifier domain restriction for this kind of behaviour. Participants judged generic majority characteristic statements like ‘tigers have stripes’ or statements with universal quantifiers with different sensitivity to quantifier domain restriction preceded by one of three levels of context (neutral, contradictory and supportive). We found that context significantly affected the rates at which participants accepted universally quantified statements. Our results demonstrate that quantifier domain restriction is a viable alternative explanation for a significant proportion of the judgements of universally quantified statements that have been called GOG errors.",0,1

"This paper is concerned mainly with the choice of a figure of merit for representing the performance of connected-word recognisers when DP word-symbol sequence matching is used for the scoring. Properties of the DP scoring method are discussed. Experimental tests using data from the DARPA Resource Management Task confirm a prediction made from random number simulations that DP scoring overestimates substitution errors and underestimates insertion and deletion errors. As a result, the commonly used total error measure has a particularly large bias. The use of an alternative measure, percent correct, results in lower bias but ignores insertion errors. A new figure of merit, weighted total errors, takes all three kinds of errors into account and minimises bias. Finally, some more sophisticated figures of merit are discussed briefly. Dieser Beitrag beschäftigt sich im wesentlichen mit der Wahl eines Maßes zur quantitativen Beschreibung der Leistungsfähigkeit von Spracherkennungssystemen für Wortketten, wenn bei der Klassifizierung eine Methode der dynamischen Programmierung (DP) zur Identifizierung von Wortfolgen verwendet wird. Einige Eigenschaften dieser DP-Klassifizierungsmethode werden diskutiert. Experimentelle Tests, die Daten von der DARPA-Resource-Management-Aufgabe verwenden, bestätigen eine Voraussage, die anhand von Simulationen mit Zufallszahlen gewonnen wurde, nämlich daß bei der Klassifizierung mit Hilfe der DP Fehler durch Verwechslungen zu hoch, jedoch Fehler durch Auslassungen bzw. überzählig “erkannte” Wörter zu gering bewertet werden. Als Folge hiervon beitet die üblicherweise angegebene Gesamtfehlerzahl ein einseitiges Bild des tatsächlichen Fehlerverhaltens. Ein alternatives Maß, der Prozentsatz korrekt erkannter Wörter, beschreibt die Verhältnisse realistischer, ignoriert aber Fehler durch überzählige Wörter. Ein neues Fehlermaß, die gewichtete Gesamtfehlerrate, berücksichtigt alle drei Fehlerarten und vermindert somit die Überbewertung eines bestimmten Fehlertypes. Am Rande werden noch einige komplexere Qualitäts- bzw. Fehlermaße für Spracherkennungssysteme diskutiert. Cet article traite principalement du choix d'un critère pour évaluer l'efficacité d'un système de reconnaissance de mots enchaînes, lorsque l'on utilise la programmation dynamique pour quantifier les correspondances entre suites de mots. Certaines propriétés de l'évaluation par la méthode de programmation dynamique sont analysées. Des expériences menées avec des données du DARPA Research Management Task ont confirmé les prédictions faites à partir de simulations avec des nombres aléatoires: l'évaluation par programmation dynamique surestime le nombre d'erreurs de substitution et sous estime le nombre d'erreurs d'insertion et d'omission. Le biais du critère habituellement utilisé, le nombre total d'erreurs, est en conséquence particulièrement grand. Un autre critère, le pourcentage de mots reconnus, diminue ce biais mais ne tient pas compte des erreurs d'insertion. Un nouveau critère, le nombre total des erreurs pondérées, tient compte des trois types d'erreurs et minimise le biais. Enfin, certains critères d'évaluation plus sophistiqués sont abordés.",0,1

"Urban bias remains a debated topic in South Africa in many spheres of society. Due to the logic of apartheid, ‘rural’ came to mean ‘black’; or in post-apartheid-speak ‘previously disadvantaged’. Up to today, the effects of long-term structural and systematic disadvantaging are quite tangible in the country. Though in parts also applicable to urban settings, poverty, insufficient infrastructure and lack of access are largely foremost still a problem of the rural – and mostly black – population. These structural imbalances are purported through a number of social fields including academia. Often, studies are conducted where access and conveniences are close and risks impeding the successful completion of research projects are low. While the tendency to consider feasibility in research is not per se questionable, the total body of research projects and results might foreground a distorted reflection of South Africa’s sociolinguistic landscape. Binary categories of urban/rural, however, carry a certain bias within themselves and are thus not comfortably fitting in a South African context but call for deconstruction. On this background, the chapter presents a critical review of 135 scholarly articles (2010–2017) from the eminent linguistic journal Southern African Linguistics and Applied Language Studies examined for traces of urban bias in the research set up and weighs the results in the light of the current socio-political situation in South Africa.

"Conversational memory is subject to a number of biases. For instances, references which were reused during dialogue are remembered better than non-reused references. Two experiments examined whether speakers are aware that they are subject to such biases and whether they use information about reference origin (i.e., information about who said what) to determine which references are remembered better by their partner. Pairs of participants performed a map task followed by a questionnaire that assessed each participant’s content memory as well as each participant’s estimation of his or her partner’s memory. In Experiment 1, the participants were unaware that they would perform a memory test after the map task, whereas the participants were mutually aware of the upcoming memory test in Experiment 2. The results revealed that participants did know that their partner was subject to memory biases and that their estimation of these biases was mainly accurate. The results prevented us from drawing any conclusions about the role of origin memory in this process. These results have important implications for subsequent dialogic partner-adaptation.",0,1

"Reviewed by: Research in Afroasiatic grammar ed. by Jacqueline Lecarme, Jean Lowenstamm, Ur Shlonsky Andrew Nevins Research in Afroasiatic grammar. Ed. by Jacqueline Lecarme, Jean Lowenstamm, and Ur Shlonsky. (Current issues in linguistic theory 202.) Amsterdam: John Benjamins, 2002. Pp. 250. ISBN 1556199805. $114 (Hb). This is a collection of papers from the Third Conference on Afroasiatic Languages (Sophia Antipolis, France, 1996). Though the papers are sequenced alphabetically by author, in discussing their content, I group them here thematically. Four papers discuss subject placement in Semitic. In ‘On the status of AgrS in some null subject languages’, Ahmed Akkal and Abdel-kader Gonegai propose that preverbal subjects in Standard Arabic (SA) are topics, thematically connected to a resumptive pronoun, namely verbal agreement. Elabbas Benmamoun accounts for the lack of number agreement in VS order in SA in ‘Agreement asymmetries and the PF interface’. He proposes that after the verb and subject undergo PF merger, the number feature is spelled out only once (by the DP). In ‘Word order in Hebrew’, Edit Doron tackles the question of whether VS order in Hebrew is the result of a VSO syntax, with the verb in IP, or a V2 syntax. After noting that topicalization in an embedded clause blocks extraction from that clause, she convincingly argues that Modern Hebrew has only the V2 strategy. Ur Shlonsky argues for a split-CP analysis of the left periphery in SA. In ‘Remarks on the complementizer layer of Standard Arabic’, he distinguishes topicalization from focalization (through criteria of case, resumption, and specificity) and discusses the syntax of ForceP, ultimately arriving at an articulated cartography for A’ movement. Four papers focus on NP/DP structure. Miriam Engelhardt discusses argument-taking nominals in Hebrew in ‘Bare NPs’. She argues that activity-nominals lack a determiner, leading to their inability to host subjects, agreement, or definiteness. In ‘Wolof genitive constructions and the construct state’, Alain Kihm shows that Wolof possessives are head-initial and spread definiteness, suggesting affinities with the Semitic construct state and hence, parallel analyses. In ‘Possession in sentences and noun phrases’, Jamal Ouhalla argues that in Moroccan Arabic possessive NPs, the possessor binds a variable in the possessee, while in possessive sentences, predication takes place, suggesting a wholly different syntax for the two constructions. In the especially clear and intriguing ‘Nonnominal constructs’, Tal Siloni discusses adjectival and gerundive construct-states in Hebrew, arguing that the construct phenomenon is cross-categorial and depends not on [−definite], but on [−tense]. Six papers are on morphology and phonology. In ‘Distributed morphology: Impoverishment and fission’, Morris Halle illustrates two postsyntactic operations in Semitic: impoverishment, which deletes features from a terminal node, and fission, which creates a secondary position of exponence for the unrealized features of a single terminal. In ‘Distributing features and affixes in Arabic subject verb agreement paradigms’, Abdelkader Fassi Fehri argues against Halle’s analysis, proposing that the prefixal nature of person morphemes and suffixal nature of number/gender morphemes in the imperfect conjugation calls for a syntactic analysis in which person is an incorporated pronoun in MoodP. Ali Idrissi argues in ‘On Berber plurals’ that some Berber plurals (in particular, A-plurals, which involve internal modification) are not derived from the corresponding singulars; rather, both are derived from a common nominal base. Jean Lowenstamm, in ‘The no straddling effect and its interpretation: A formal property of Chaha 2nd feminine singular formation’, discusses the exponent of feminine in the imperative, a classic Gurage floating feature that either triggers palatalization or surfaces as /i/. Lowenstamm’s proposal is that it’s a suffix without templatic support, and its mobility is due to a constraint that a governing relation cannot straddle a stem-affix boundary. Gábor Takács performs thorough lexical comparison in ‘Recent problems of Egyptian historical phonology at the present stage of comparative-historical Afroasiatic linguistics’ to illustrate the reconstruction process for, for example, the identity of Egyptian aleph.

"The German standard language shows diatopic variation on all linguistic levels. This article analyses to what extent lexicography does justice to this situation.

In this context, the article shows which criteria are used to classify a variety as belonging to the standard in each case, in connection to which database these classifications take place and which information is provided concerning the diatopic-grammatical variation. The last chapter illustrates with two examples how dictionaries on grammatical-diatopic variation in standard German may be designed and which procedure is best suited for the collection of data in this case. The paper is therefore located at the interface between research in grammar, variational linguistics and lexicography.",0,1
"Focusing on turn-taking, this article investigates how embodiment and environmentally coupled gestures are used by a signed language interpreter to facilitate intersubjective understanding of the speaker’s identity in interpreter-mediated dialogues between deaf and hearing students. The researcher draws on observations, interviews, and video-recorded data from a case study situated in a Norwegian mainstream, upper secondary school. In the classrooms, hearing students can identify different speakers’ by distinguishing their voices and looking around to see who is talking. However, deaf and hard-of-hearing students can find it more difficult to identify the speaker, especially in multi-party interactions. They are often unable to hear others’ voices directly, and in interpreter-mediated dialogues their gaze is mostly focused on the interpreter’s mediation. This study shows how the interpreter uses several environmentally coupled gestures to mediate information about the ongoing interaction, including speaker identity. The gestures include pointing, shifts in body positions (left–right stepping while standing, and left–right orienting while sitting), shifts in gaze orientation, and shifts in face gestures. Both deaf and hearing students use the mediated resources as information cues to coordinate their interaction, and to establish an intersubjective understanding of actions within participation frameworks.",0,1
"Political reform in the Middle East has been largely inspired by foreign models. Ideas such as liberalism, parliaments, and constitutions have been borrowed from Europe, superimposed on local foundations, and assimilated, with varying degrees of resemblance to the original prototypes. The foreign ideas were initially conveyed to the region's society through local idioms. But since local languages were by definition inadequately equipped for the task, concepts were loosely represented and conceived. The discussion of these ideas during the formative phase was marked by ambiguity, which in turn seems to have impeded their assimilation. Taking Arabic as an example the paper illustrates these difficulties by focusing on three political terms: majlis, nuwwāb, and shūrā - three old words applied to modern concepts. That they carried traditional connotations often resulted in equivocalness and loose communication of the new ideas, indirectly hampering reform itself. Typical of the nineteenth century, the phenomenon persisted in some sectors well into the second half of the twentieth century",0,1
"The goal of this article is to investigate the temporal properties of German present participles, occurring prenominally and in secondary predication, in an event semantic approach. Empirically, the study relies in part on the corpus-based descriptions of prenominal participles presented in Lübbe & Rapp (2011). I will argue that—according to Keshet’s (2008),Intersective Predicate Generalization—present participles are always temporally dependent on their sister constituent. If they occur in secondary predication, this sister constituent is the main clause VP; if they occur prenominally, it is the modified noun. The temporal relation with the noun / the main clause predicate is simultaneity (cf. Kusumoto 1999, 2005), but this simultaneity relation can be altered by temporal adverbials like gestern ‘yesterday’ and früher ‘formerly’. The article will also consider whether there is a grammatically determined temporal relation between a prenominal present participle and the main clause. I will argue that prenominal present participles are dependent on the main clause predicate only if the participle is embedded in a DP with a non-presuppositional (= indefinite) determiner. Non-presuppositional determiners create intersective temporal interpretations: they lexically fix the interpretation of their NP complement (including attributes) as being simultaneous with the main clause predicate. Presuppositional determiners, in contrast, do not fix such a relation, that is the temporal interpretation of the NP complement (including attributes) is semantically free and guided by pragmatic principles (cf. Musan 1997, 1999, Tonhauser 2012). There are, however, some apparent counterexamples to the temporal dependency of (syntactically or lexically given) intersective structures (cf. Kusumoto 1999; Tonhauser 2012). I will show that the intersective interpretation can be maintained if we assume that these examples involve a specific kind of noun, label nouns. These are personal nouns referring to situations that can be used to characterize an individual even when the situation is already over (Mörder ‘murderer’, Flüchtling ‘fugitive’). The article is structured as follows: I begin by presenting the relevant data in section 1. Then, in section 2, I present an event semantic account of present participle phrases in different positions. Section 3 examines the role the determiner plays in the interpretation of prenominal participles, and section 4 focuses on cases with a definite determiner. Section 5 looks at some examples which seem to be problematic for the interpretation of intersective structures and introduces the concept of label nouns. Finally, section 6 examines the combination of temporal adverbials with present participles.",0,1

"Abstract I argue that denial plays a central but insufficiently recognized role in addiction. The puzzle inherent in addiction is why drug use persists despite negative consequences. The orthodox conception of addiction resolves this puzzle by appeal to compulsion; but there is increasing evidence that addicts are not compelled to use but retain choice and control over their consumption in many circumstances. Denial offers an alternative explanation: there is no puzzle as to why drug use persists despite negative consequences if these consequences are not straightforwardly known. I describe the nature of the causal knowledge that one's drug use is causing negative consequences; map the conceptual landscape of denial and explain how it can block such knowledge; and explore some of the processes and mechanisms that have been studied by philosophy and the cognitive sciences and which may underpin denial in addiction, including well‐established information‐processing biases, motivational influences on belief formation and self‐deception, and cognitive deficits with respect to insight and self‐awareness. I conclude by suggesting that addiction is as much a disorder of cognition as a disorder of conation.",0,1

"The topic of linguistic landscapes (LLs) is very important in the area of sociolinguistics of multilingual societies. A linguistic landscape reflects the underlying ideologies regarding languages and their speakers, linguistic diversity, language statuses and perceived values. This study investigated multilingual LL of Cyprus under the conceptual framework of Geo–semiotics by implementing an in–depth qualitative and quantitative landscape analysis of visible semiotic signs in public space, trying to interpret their indexicality and deeper layers of meaning in relation to multilingualism situation in the country, the link between discourse and space, as well as the perceptions and attitudes of the Greek Cypriot population towards multilingualism and multilingual LL. We used photographic material in our data collection – 4,200 photos of all geographical areas of Cyprus, which were analysed quantitatively and qualitatively and interpreted in terms of language, arrangement of displayed text and images, LL genre, visual semiotics, placement and surroundings in line with the principles of the symbolic construction of the public space. It was found that sign readers have a positive attitude towards multilingualism and multilingual signs in Cyprus and that the LL in Cyprus is complex and unique and is related to the political economy of language and space.",0,1

"ABSTRACT This study compared vocal features of deception that can be measured by acoustic equipment with vocal features of deception that can be measured perceptually by human coders. As deception researchers have traditionally measured vocal behavior with either acoustic or perceptual methods (but not both), it is uncertain what correspondence, if any, exists between these methods. This study attempted to determine the degree of this correspondence. Deceptive interactions from an earlier study (Burgoon, Buller, Ebesu, &amp; Rockwell, 1994) were used to conduct a detailed analysis of the vocal features of deceptive speech. The vocal samples were analyzed perceptually and acoustically. Results indicated moderate correlations between some acoustic and perceptual variables; neither measurement type, however, proved conclusively superior to the other in discriminating between truth and deception.",0,1

Apologies and quasi apologies are shown to be part of a wider repertoire of strategies including alignment with those affected, disassociation from negative events, scapegoating of perpetrators, and promises of future good conduct. These findings are discussed in terms of the banks’ ongoing relationship with shareholders, and their wider reputation management endeavours.",0,1

"In a multilingual country like India, automatic natural language translation plays a key role in building a community with different linguistic people. Many researchers have explored and improved the translation process for high-resource languages such as English, German, etc., and achieved state-of-the-art results. However, the unavailability of adequate data is the prime obstacle to automatic natural language translation of low-resource north-eastern Indian languages such as Mizo, Khasi, and Assamese. Though the recent past has witnessed a deluge in several automatic natural language translation systems for low-resource languages, the low values of their evaluation measures indicate the scope for improvement. In the recent past, the neural machine translation approach has significantly improved translation quality, and the credit goes to the availability of a huge amount of data. Subsequently, the neural machine translation approach for low-resource language is underrepresented due to the unavailability of adequate data. In this work, we have considered a low-resource English–Assamese pair using the transformer-based neural machine translation, which leverages the use of prior alignment and a pre-trained language model. To extract alignment information from the source–target sentences, we have used the pre-trained multilingual contextual embeddings-based alignment technique. Also, the transformer-based language model is built using monolingual target sentences. With the use of both prior alignment and a pre-trained language model, the transformer-based neural machine translation model shows improvement, and we have achieved state-of-the-art results for the English-to-Assamese and Assamese-to-English translation, respectively.",0,1
"WE ARE TRAVELING DOWN A BROAD, tree-lined street in north Bali, Indonesia, past old houses built in the Dutch colonial style, past handcarts selling flavored ice or soup. Small vans hell bent on collecting as many passengers as possible are passing us while also breaking speed limits.1 We turn left down a steep, narrow street and spot a large sign that says SLB Bagian B.2 Students ranging from kindergarten age to late secondary school, dressed in neat white shirts and blue or gray shorts or skirts, are pouring out of the ajrawd (boardinghouse) to our left, spilling across the road and into the maze of one-story school buildings. Their faces are lively as their hands fly, signing jokes or abuse, teasing, and dealing with the mundane realities of everyday life. Their signing is fluid, seamless. Sounds ring out as some occasionally voice words or simply utter sounds of joy, disgust, or laughter, but the communicative process is entirely signed. The students greet us enthusiastically, and they find our signing a source of interest and mirth. We wait patiently while they disappear into the buildings and then move unobtrusively from class to class. In one room an articulation teacher sits with a small group of eight-year-olds. One young boy sits very near the teacher, attempting to copy her in the voicing of vowels. The others sign to one another as they await their turn. In another room a group of senior students is facing the front of the class as a teacher writes notes on the board about religion and occasionally turns and speaks to the class with exaggerated mouth movements. In another room a teacher is speaking slowly and signing at the same time as he conducts a math lesson. And in yet another a teacher speaks, occasionally using a sign or fingerspelling while talking. In all of the classes the students sign to each other when the teacher is not looking. All of the teachers' speech and all of the articulation training is in the national language, Indonesian. Eighteen-year-old Ketut has just left the school and returned to his village twenty kilometers away in the foothills of the mountains. He can read and write Indonesian but only very poorly. He articulates to a degree if required to do so and always in Indonesian. He was able to lipread the Indonesian of some of his teachers but finds other people difficult or impossible to understand. He is fluent in the sign language of the school. In his village, however, Indonesian is never used in community activities, only in dealings with government officials. Everyone speaks Balinese. Two other deaf people live in his village, but he has no contact with them. They are not part of his ritual community, and shared deafness is not seen as a basis for association. His family and neighbors sign to him, using the signs he learned with them before he left for school. Nobody uses the school's sign language. Neighbors ask Ketut what he learned at school. Wanting him to show his skills, they ask whether he can speak. When they talk without signing, he tries to read their lips, but they are not using Indonesian. In a nearby village Nyoman, who has also left the school, sits in her home, lipreading her mother's Indonesian and responding with speech that her mother understands. They do not sign. Years ago, when Nyoman went deaf as a result of a fever, a teacher from the school told her mother not to sign to her. Nyoman cannot participate in community conversations in Balinese but only in one-to-one discussions in Indonesian. Even then, people must make an effort to articulate clearly so that she can lipread and they must try to understand her high-pitched monotone speech. She rarely sees any of her former school friends. Farther into the hills Made sits making baskets that he sells in local markets. He is fifty years old and has never been to school. He can read a little and write with difficulty, skills he has learned at home and in the markets. He can lipread Balinese with some success but communicates mostly by signing. …",0,1

"Abstract This article investigates the expression of progressive aspect by means of verbal periphrases in the Italo‐Greek variety known as Grico, spoken in Salento (southern Italy). Building on the extremely valuable, yet out‐dated, description of Rohlfs ( ), we first present an overview of the array of different patterns brought to light by our recent fieldwork and through a survey of a selection of both early and contemporary sources which include combinations of (non‐)inflected STAND with (non‐)finite forms of a lexical verb, optionally linked by functional elements. After describing the empirical picture, we assess the degree of grammaticalization of the patterns which are still productive today, reconstructing their evolution from earlier periphrases and paying particular attention to the grammaticalization of the ambiguous element pu ‘where; from; that’. Finally, we analyse a hybrid structure currently consistently produced by semi‐speakers from different villages, which seems to instantiate a new ‘third’ option within the local repertoire. The article concludes with of a number of observations about the role of this case study for our knowledge of diatopic morphosyntactic microvariation in Grico and for the nature of language contact and language change.",0,1

New York: Macmillan, 1973. —. English English. Essex, CT: Verbatim, 1980. The Oxford English Dictionary and the State of the Language. Robert W. Burchfield and Hans Aarsleff. Washington, DC: Library of Congress, 1988. 56 pp. $3.95. In May 1986, the Library of Congress held a festival and symposium celebrating the completion of the final volume of Burchfield's Supplement to the Oxford English Dictionary Reviews267 (1972-86). Daniel J. Boorstin, a distinguished American historian and then Librarian of Congress, praised the English language and celebrated lexicographers. Robert and Elizabeth Burchfield (accompanied by minders)1 were feted with an ostentation that must have been some recompense for years of lonely dictionary-making; they had just been in New Orleans (where ghetto-blaster, Burchfield reports [30], is used in the sense current in the Oxfordshire village in which he lives) and were about to depart for Japan on a round-theworld sales tour. The Library of Congress, after some delay, presents in this booklet three papers given on that occasion in Washington, two by Burchfield and one by Hans Aarsleff. Aarsleff's ""The Original Plan for the OED and Its Background "" (34-43) rehearses the ideas discussed in his account of the same subject published in 1962—for instance, the influence of Richard Chenevix Trench on the formation of the Dictionary. In his youthful excursus on this subject, Aarsleff did something no one had ever done before: he called James Murray a liar. What he had described as a ""false statement "" and ""Murray's mistake"" was the assertion in Murray's Romanes lecture that the OED was part of The Evolution of English Lexicography. Contrary to Murray's claim that Charles Richardson's Dictionary was the immediate ancestor of his work, Aarsleff had written: ""the OED depends for its lexicography entirely on Liddell and Scott's Greek-English Lexicon, first published in 1843 and itself merely an English version of a great work by the German classicist Franz Passow "" (419). In his Washington lecture, Aarsleff used a passive verb to dilute his earlier and more personal attack: ""It has been said that the OED is lineally descended from a long succession of English dictionaries, as if by a process of natural evolution, but this is not true"" (43). A more minute examination of Passow's lexicographical practice and of the OED, lately published by Ladislav Zgusta, vindicates Murray : ""One hardly could . . . assume that Liddell-Scott was 268Reviews Murray's inspiration, or even the main source of his inspiration "" (221). Burchfield's two lectures were genial and fresh. In one, ""Editing a Supplement to the OED, 1957-1986"" (46-56), he offered a memoir divided into sections: beginning (Burchfield in his ""pre-lexicographical period"" [48] and his novitiate), middle (celebratory comments in the press), and end (of what A. J. Aitken has called ""the long slog to Z'). The other lecture is an Olympian view of English and its dictionaries. Oxford is an intellectual village, and, like other villagers, its denizens suppose that outsiders are profoundly interested in its gossip and spats. In 1982, Roy Harris, Oxford's Professor of Linguistics, wrote an essay in The Times Literary Supplement claiming that historical lexicography generally and the OED specifically constitute ""a suspect enterprise which smacks of cultural subversion."" Alphabetical ordering makes no sense; quoting ""reputable authors"" is elitist; historical principles do not reflect language...",0,1
"Most types of behavioural research are difficult to carry out, at least with acceptable rigour; investigation of the effects of ethanol upon speech is a good example of such a challenge. To date bur little research on the issue has been reported; the problem here appears to be the difficulty in developing and carrying our appropriate experiments. In response, the thrust of the present project was two-fold: ( 1) to address the robustness/accuracy of traditional investigational procedures and (2) to generate controlled pilot data on speech-intoxication relationships. First, both established and new methodologies were assessed and attempts were made to correlate the physiological approaches with the behavioural. Second, initial data was gathered on the suprasegmentals of speech. To accomplish these goals, carefully selected subjects were studied at a number of highly controlled levels of intoxication. It was found that traditional approaches resulted in difficulties with experimental precision whereas modified procedures could be used to overcome these problems. Second, while the aural-perceptual data did not correlate very well with the physiological, some information was gained as to how to assess motor speech deficits under controlled procedures. Finally, measures of FO shift exhibited an upward trend for most speakers, and duration was increased, as a function of increments in intoxication.",0,1

"We studied lexical expressions of time in Russian Sign Language (RSL). We collected lexical signs describing a variety of time-related concepts produced by fifteen RSL signers from different regions. We then analyzed semantic, iconic, and morphological properties of these signs, as well as possible interaction between RSL and Russian in this domain. We found out that RSL has a large system of time-related lexemes of all common semantic types. Some of these signs are iconic (and involve metonymy and metaphor). Other signs are noniconic, and probably borrowed from Russian, as they involve initialization or assimilated fingerspelling sequences. Morphologically, many of the basic time-related signs are simple, but RSL also has a number of compounds in this domain. Finally, numeral incorporation is very common for lexical time expressions in RSL, although it is restricted by both lexical and phonological constraints.",0,1

"Previous studies of dependency distance as a measure of, or a proxy for, syntactic complexity do not consider factors such as sentence length and root distance. In the present study, we propose a new algorithm, i.e. Normalized Dependency Distance (NDD), that takes sentence length and root distance into consideration. Our analysis showed that exponential distribution fit well the distribution model of NDD as it did with Mean Dependency Distance (MDD), the algorithm used in previous studies. Findings indicated that NDD is significantly less dependent on sentence length than MDD is, which suggests that the new algorithm may have, to some extent, addressed the issue of MDD’s dependency on sentence length. It is argued that NDD may serve as a measure of syntactic complexity, which is a kind of universality limited by the capacity of human working memory.",0,1

The speech-language pathologist thought the patient was not aphasic but rather was stuttering and treated her for about a month with pacing and ""easy onset"" techniques to which she showed fair response. The diagnostic question in this case is whether the stuttering was the result of the brain damage (neurogenic) or of the stressful events she had experienced (psychogenic). In this article we review her case and the process we used in arriving at an ""expert"" opinion.",0,1
"Multi-modal discourse comprehension requires speakers to combine information from speech and gestures. To date, little research has addressed the cognitive resources that underlie these processes. Here we used a dual-task paradigm to test the relative importance of verbal and visuospatial working memory in speech-gesture comprehension. Healthy, college-aged participants encoded either a series of digits (verbal load) or a series of dot locations in a grid (visuospatial load) and rehearsed them (secondary memory task) as they performed a (primary) multi-modal discourse comprehension task. Regardless of the secondary task, performance on the discourse comprehension task was better when the speaker’s gestures and speech were congruent than when they were incongruent. However, the congruity advantage was smaller when the concurrent memory task involved a visuospatial load than when it involved a verbal load. Results suggest that taxing the visuospatial working memory system reduced participants’ ability to benefit from the information in congruent iconic gestures. A control experiment demonstrated that results were not an artifact of the difficulty of the visuospatial load task. Overall, these data suggest speakers recruit visuospatial working memory to interpret gestures about concrete visual scenes.",0,1

"The performance of Kriolu rap in Lisbon, Portugal has emerged at a time when Western European countries are reassessing the relationship between national territory and identity. Attractive to some and disturbing to others are the attitude and flair of Kriolu rappers. A group of mostly young men of Cape Verdean descent, these rappers insist on speaking and singing in Kriolu, a creole language that lacks official‐language status in both Portugal and Cape Verde. In this article, based on analyses of rap lyrics, excerpts from my fieldwork conversations with rappers, and structural features of the Kriolu language itself, I propose that Kriolu rap is a renewed interrogation of diaspora and of place‐based identity. More generally, I propose that, when contextualized in terms of cultural history and (post)colonial politics, Kriolu rap offers insight into the relationship between words and music as part of a process of combining aesthetics with social claims.

"Abstract This paper reviews some basic elements of musical structure, drawing from work in traditional and cognitive musicology, ethnomusicology, psychology, and generative textsetting. Music features two different hierarchical representational components that can both be visualised in grid notation: metrical structure and event hierarchies (also referred to as Time‐Span Reduction). Metrical structure is an abstract pattern of stronger and weaker points in time that form a temporal ‘scaffold’ against which auditory events occur, but is partly independent from those occurring events. Event hierarchies encode the constituency (referred to as grouping ) and prominence of actually‐occurring musical events. Basic principles of these components are illustrated with examples from Western children's, folk, and popular song. The need for both metrical hierarchy and event hierarchy is illustrated using mismatches between metrical and rhythmic structure. The formal, conceptual, and empirical features of musical metre are quite different from linguistic stress and prosody, despite the frequent analogies drawn between them. Event hierarchies, on the other hand, are shown to resemble linguistic prosodic structure with regard to all of these features.",0,1
"This study investigates whether alternation learning is facilitated by a matching phonotactic generalization. In a series of artificial grammar learning experiments, English learners were trained on artificial languages evincing categorical vowel harmony alternations across morpheme boundaries. These languages differed in the degree of harmony within stems (disharmonic, semiharmonic, and harmonic), and thus the degree of phonotactic support for the alternation. Results indicate that alternation learning was best when supported by matching stem phonotactics (harmonic language; experiment 1). Learners, however, were reluctant to extend a learned phonotactic constraint to novel unseen alternations (experiments 2 and 3). Taken together, the results are consistent with the hypothesis that alternation learning is facilitated by a matching static phonotactic generalization, but that learners are conservative in positing alternations in the absence of overt evidence for them.",0,1
"The majority of the world’s languages have little to no NLP resources or tools. This is due to a lack of training data (“resources”) over which tools, such as taggers or parsers, can be trained. In recent years, there have been increasing efforts to apply NLP methods to a much broader swath of the world’s languages. In many cases this involves bootstrapping the learning process with enriched or partially enriched resources. We propose that Interlinear Glossed Text (IGT), a very common form of annotated data used in the field of linguistics, has great potential for bootstrapping NLP tools for resource-poor languages. Although IGT is generally very richly annotated, and can be enriched even further (e.g., through structural projection), much of the content is not easily consumable by machines since it remains “trapped” in linguistic scholarly documents and in human readable form. In this paper, we describe the expansion of the ODIN resource—a database containing many thousands of instances of IGT for over a thousand languages. We enrich the original IGT data by adding word alignment and syntactic structure. To make the data in ODIN more readily consumable by tool developers and NLP researchers, we adopt and extend a new XML format for IGT, called Xigt. We also develop two packages for manipulating IGT data: one, INTENT, enriches raw IGT automatically, and the other, XigtEdit, is a graphical IGT editor.",0,1
"The machine-readable dictionary (MRD) is a major resource in the task of building a large-scale lexicon for a natural-language system. Because these dictionaries were written for human users, not computers, they show evidence of inconsistency of treatment, ambiguity within entries, and lack of systematicity in the explicit statement of essential facts. This ‘human bias’ makes dictionary mapping very difficult and of limited worth. Electronic text corpora now allow the evaluation of a dictionary entry by comparing it with actual word use in running text. This is done for several lexical items across five MRDs; corpus evidence is shown to support apparently incompatible semantic descriptions. An outline is given for part of a lexical database entry which could facilitate the mapping of dictionary entries and consequently maximize the useful facts to be extracted from a number of MRDs",0,1
"This article analyzes interactions taking place in two transient communities involving local and international actors at a Catalan university. In scenarios in which established norms for language use are less available, people from different language backgrounds face the practical issue of establishing a common means for accomplishing understanding. This study examines how participants in the encounters establish a plurilingual medium of interaction, despite other solutions being available to them. It further proposes the notion of “doing understanding” to refer to the situated, jointly constructed and embodied performance of sharing repertoires. The results demonstrate how participants locally construct and challenge norms and possibilities of language use in transient communities in international higher education, supporting more critical consideration of how languages should be categorized by universities in their internationalization pursuits in seeking harmony with linguistic diversity. En aquest article s'analitzen interaccions que tenen lloc en dues comunitats transitòries en una universitat catalana, amb actors locals i internacionals. En escenaris en què les normes habituals dels usos lingüístics són poc conegudes, persones d'orígens lingüístics diferents s'enfronten al problema pràctic de negociar la manera de comunicar-se. Aquest estudi examina com les persones estableixen un mitjà d'interacció plurilingüe, tot havent-hi d'altres solucions disponibles. A més, es proposa la noció de “fer comprensió” (“doing understanding”) per referir-se a com les persones s'orienten cap a un repertori compartit de manera situada, co-construïda i incardinada. Els resultats demostren com els participants construeixen i desafien localment les normes i les possibilitats dels usos lingüístics en comunitats transitòries a l'ensenyament superior, la qual cosa permet de reflexionar críticament sobre com les llengües han de ser categoritzades per les universitats en les seves activitats d'internacionalització en harmonia amb la diversitat lingüística.",0,1
"This paper highlights the challenges encountered by the African Languages Lexical (ALLEX) Project (at present the African Languages Research Institute (ALRI)) in Harare, Zimbabwe, which is in the process of compiling an advanced Shona dictionary (ASD). Its forerunner is the general Shona dictionary, Duramazwi ReChishona (1996). The ASD is intended to be a comprehensive reference work, which will serve as a resource for more advanced users, especially those at higher secondary and tertiary education levels. The most important challenges have been in the areas of headword selection and the treatment of geographical/individual variation. The matters discussed here show the conflict between usage, i.e. popular acceptance, and (orthographic) norm, a problem often experienced in young literary languages subject to heavy foreign influence. This paper looks at: (a) the limitations of the current Shona orthography, the selection and codification of international vocabulary, and the presentation of variants and synonyms in the dictionary, and (b) the solutions suggested, and/or the ongoing debate on the topics. Keywords: headword, compilation, dictionary, general dictionary, advanced dictionary, international vocabulary, variant, variation, synonym, cross-reference, implicit cross-reference, explicit cross-reference",0,1
"The aims of this study were to describe the type and amount of experiences students have in the area of disability and determine whether significant differences in attitudes towards disability were present across three groups of students engaged in clinical practice and if attitudes changed over time. Twenty-two first professional year undergraduate, twenty-three first year postgraduate and twenty-three final year undergraduate speech-language therapy students participated in the study. A mixed method, cross-sectional pre-test post-test design was employed for all groups. Participants took part in part-time clinical placement experiences over a twelve-week period. Pre and post clinical placement, participants completed a questionnaire, including The Scales of Attitudes towards Disabled Persons (SADP) (Antonak [1982]. Development and psychometric analysis of the scale of attitudes toward disabled persons. Journal of Applied Rehabilitation Counselling, 13, 22–29), that was designed to examine experiences and attitudes towards disability and change over time. Overall, students reported almost all had personal experience with people with disabilities and over half of students sampled reported prior or current workplace experience. Students perceived their attitudes towards disability to be positive. In contrast to our hypotheses, student attitudes towards disability did not change significantly over time. Furthermore, first year postgraduate students held more positive attitudes towards disability compared to other student groups. Implications for clinical teaching and supervision in the workplace are discussed.",0,1
"Abstract This paper identifies the nature of the administrative policies prior to ‘The Wyndham Report’ and then traces changes up until the late 1970s. It reports research that used documentary analysis and depth interviews, and has three main findings. First, the administrative policy changes from 1962 to 1979 overlooked their impact on Languages education. Second, school-based decision making exposed Languages to diverse administrative practices, including those that reinforced elitism. Third, the falling numbers of candidates being examined in Languages in the late 1970s was only halted by the introduction of ‘Z Courses’ and by the demand for community languages. From the earliest days of civilization — and until quite recently — it went without saying that the principal business of education was to ensure that an educated person had a mastery of language.

"Abstract Filial piety is a basic value in Chinese culture and has been a prominent theme in China’s televised public service advertisements (PSAs). This study takes a multimodal discourse analysis approach to study such PSAs promoting filial piety. We consider filial values as represented through characters’ emotions and attributes, which are realized by linguistic and visual resources on the one hand and shaped by the broader sociocultural context on the other. An explicit framework based on the attitude schema is developed to systemically describe the realization of social values in multimodal discourse. Analysis shows that filial values are mainly realized through verbal and visual representation of reciprocal love between the parent and the son/daughter, as well as filial behaviors of the latter. Our contextual analysis conceptualizes the filial piety PSAs as a form of discursive governance and finds that PSAs resort to two main persuasive strategies, namely emotionalization and moralization, which are results of media marketization and internationalization. We find that promoting filial piety serves China’s governance by addressing two needs of the authority: the practical need of supporting the elderly and the spiritual need of moral reconstruction and reinforcing cultural identity in contemporary China.",0,1
"This article presents new data on allophonic variation of the Polish vowel commonly transcribed as /ɨ/ and frequently analyzed as phonologically back (e.g., Rubach 1984; Gussmann 2007). The new data were collected using 3D ultrasound images from ten native speakers of Polish. While vowels in the context of labial and dental stops do not differ significantly, being articulated with a high front position of the tongue in both environments, the /ɨ/ assimilates to preceding velar stop consonants and is produced with relatively more raising of the tongue body and with a constriction extending further back. This is to be expected if /ɨ/ is taken to be a front vowel that assimilates to a [+back] consonant. This finding has potential consequences for the analysis of palatalization in Polish.",0,1
"Knowledge of grammar includes knowledge of syntactic probabilities* Susanne Gahl and Susan Garnsey Errata 1. Grammar and language form 1.1. What gahl and garnsey (2004) show There is widespread consensus that one of the tasks of a grammar is to describe the form of language. What Gahl and Garnsey (2004; henceforth G&G) show is that the description of both /t,d/-deletion and word and pause durations in American English needs to make reference to statements of the form ‘such-and-such a syntactic configuration has such-and-such a probability of occurrence in this context’. Therefore, in order to account for the form of language, the grammar needs to include probabilities. In particular, we argue that verb subcategorization probabilities, or verb biases, must be part of the grammar, since the match or mismatch between verb bias and syntactic context affects form. In a critique of G&G, Newmeyer (2006; henceforth N) agrees that the description of /t,d/-deletion and of other aspects of pronunciation reflects probabilities. However, N argues that the relevant probabilities are ‘extra-grammatical’: ‘generalizations about usage lie outside of grammar per se’ (N, p. 2). We acknowledge that subcategorization probabilities are a function of usage—they are that by definition, in fact. But the fact that subcategorization probabilities are ultimately the result of language use is not at issue. What is at issue is whether speakers know subcategorization probabilities as part of their knowledge of grammar. To establish that this is the case, G&G provided evidence suggesting that subcategorization probabilities affect language form even in situations where only syntactic probabilities, not meaning biases, can guide language production. In the discussion to follow, we first clarify a point about the experiment reported in G&G and briefly comment on N’s suggestions for future research on this issue. We then compare N’s meaning-based account of verb bias to the notion of syntactic probability in G&G and show that the latter correctly predicts facts about language production and comprehension that are unexplained under N’s account. Finally, we consider N’s suggestions for future research in more detail, arguing that the suggested research cannot shed any light on the issue at hand. 1.2. Controlling for meaning Reiterating a point made in Newmeyer 2003, following Lavandera 1978, N draws attention to the following fact: sentences with different syntactic structures differ in referential meaning, whereas phonological variants generally do not. As a result, any distributional differences among syntactic variants may result from meaning differences, rather than reflecting stochastic information in the grammar. For example, sentences in which a given verb, say, confirm, takes a direct object (they confirmed the date ahead of time) vs. a sentential complement (they confirmed the date was correct) differ in meaning, and hence observations about these sentences cannot be used as an argument for stochastic grammar. N argues on this basis that G&G1s argument is flawed. But it is N’s critique that is flawed here: G&G did not compare direct object (DO) sentences with sentential complement (SC) sentences. [End Page 405] Doing so would indeed have made us vulnerable to the objection raised by Lavandera. Instead, we compared sentences with high-probability DOs to those with low-probability DOs, as well as high-probability SCs to low-probability SCs. The linguistic fact that allowed us to make this comparison was that particular syntactic contexts have different probabilities of occurrence following different verbs, depending on the verbs’ bias. We compared the aggregate of high vs. low probability sentences within each type (DO or SC). We arrived at generalizations about pronunciation that pertained to sentences of a given type and a given probability, regardless of lexical content. In other words, verb biases allowed us to manipulate probabilities while keeping syntactic structure constant, thus isolating effects of probabilities from those of syntactic structure. We believe that N appreciates the fact that G&G studied phonological variation, not syntactic variation. However, an informal small-sample survey reveals that readers of N’s remarks nevertheless walk away with the impression that G&G compared DO and SC complements to one another. Oddly, the studies N suggests...",0,1

It compares these functions and distributions to those reconstructed for the Proto-Oceanic transitivizing morphemes *-i and *akin[i], and suggests pathways of change that can account for many of the present-day Äiwoo forms as being reflexes of these morphemes and of the 3sg object clitic *=a, though some of the formal differentiation remains unexplained. This analysis implies that Äiwoo has a Philippine-type symmetrical voice system with Oceanic morphology, an unusual state of affairs which has implications for our understanding of the transition from Proto-Malayo-Polynesian to Proto-Oceanic.",0,1

The view that the grammar of English has no transformational rules forming derived nominals is known as the 'lexicalist hypothesis' (henceforth 'LH'). Under LH, a derived nominal such as destruction in (1) their destruction of the property would not be derived from the verb destroy with subject they and object the property.

"This paper focuses on the scope of adverbial constituents placed in the preverbal zone. First, we show how writers can take advantage of the framing potential of these adverbials to structure their discourse. Then, we review the ways in which the notion of &#8216;scope&#8217; is used in semantics. In the last section, we argue for the notion of &#8216;framing scope&#8217; as a way to account for the organizational function these adverbials assume beyond the sentence in which they occur. A specific argument for this distinction between &#8216;semantic scope&#8217; and &#8216;framing scope&#8217; is that these adverbials have the capacity to include in their &#8216;framing scope&#8217; connectors or incidental clauses whose contents do not fall under their &#8216;semantic scope&#8217;.",0,1
"AbstractThis article investigates the syllabification of Sesotho words using a rule-based approach. A total of eleven syllabification rules are proposed based on Guma's (1982) three types of syllables, that is, consonant only (C), consonants and vowels (CV), and vowels only (V) syllable types. The syllabification rules are established using the South African Sesotho (SAS) orthography. The proposed syllabification rules are illustrated and applied to an extract from Masowa (2017). The outcomes indicate that the laws of syllabification proposed in this article are sufficient for syllabification of Sesotho words. Among other findings, we differ from Guma (1982) by proposing the removal of the /ny/ consonant digraph from the list of C syllable subtypes. Moreover, we extend Madigoe's (2003) list of CV syllable subtypes by adding two more CV syllable subtypes based on the number of consonants preceding the vowel in CV syllables. These suggested CV subtypes focus on the number of vowels that precede the consonant-vowel syllable types. We believe that if the rules suggested in this article are used correctly, the development of an automated syllabification system for Sesotho can be achieved.Rule-based syllabification in SesothoHlepholo: Athikele ena e sebedisa lewa la melao ho fuputsa kabo ya dinoko tsa Sesotho.

"Abstract This project investigates orientations toward interpersonal arguing among Chilean seniors ( N = 243), having a mean age of 72 years. We found no prior attention to seniors in the interpersonal arguing literature, and only a little to Chileans. Sited within the US framework for studying interpersonal arguing (see Hample, 2016 ), this project collected seniors’ responses to survey items indexing argumentativeness, verbal aggressiveness, argument frames, personalization of conflict, and power distance. Our exploratory work involved use of a second sample of Chilean undergraduates ( N = 80) for comparison. Comparisons showed that the seniors were less likely to argue, especially for play. Seniors were more interested in asserting dominance and were less cooperative and civil. Few sex differences were observed among the seniors, whereas quite a few had been previously found for Chilean undergraduates. These differences are attributed to the age of the seniors, although the possibility of a cadre effect is considered. Neither Chilean seniors nor younger adults displayed negative correlations between approaching and avoiding arguments, a result which has become an increasingly urgent theoretical issue across the world.",0,1
"This study was conducted to investigate two factors that affect the processing of the outcomes of intentional actions. Participants read three-sentence stories that varied the presence of an explicit goal and the semantic association between the outcome and its situational context (i.e., physical or virtual location). The ease of processing outcomes (as measured by sentence reading times) was facilitated by having an explicitly stated goal (e.g., “X wanted a beer”) that causally explained why an action (e.g., “X went to a bar”) took place and by a high degree of contextual constraint between the action (e.g., “X went to a bar” as opposed to “X went to a restaurant”) and the outcome (e.g., “X got a beer”). There was no evidence that the two factors interacted. These results suggest that readers monitor, in parallel, the associations of actions with the intentions of a character and the situational context in which those actions occur.",0,1
"Typically, the penetration of interactive voice response systems (IVRs) is described as being very high especially among large companies. The paper at hand discusses the use and adoption rate of such systems among companies, especially among small and medium-sized enterprises (SME). The study conducted shows that the penetration of IVRs is far lower (about 12%) than initially thought. The main reason stated for this low penetration level seems to be the incompatibility of the company's business model with an automated telephone answering system. However, the evaluation of results gave evidence that this reason serves as a pretext only and that the real reason(s) for not adopting an interactive voice response system might be far more complicated and profound. It is supposed that the negative historic perception of automated speech system still prevails and that IVR providers and sellers have failed to communicate the system's progress as well as its benefits and its numerous areas of application.",0,1
"Abstract This article examines the multimodal construction of ideal manhood in male participants’ self-introduction videos in a Chinese reality dating show. A framework is developed to model identity as evaluative attributes and to explicate how they are constructed through linguistic and visual resources. Analysis of 91 videos shows two versions of idealized Chinese masculinity, namely, modern masculinity (mainly embodied by participants who have won a date), and traditional masculinity (mainly embodied by participants who have not won a date). Modern masculinity highlights career-oriented qualities, socio-economic status, and luxurious lifestyles, while traditional masculinity highlights family values, skills in Chinese cultural heritage, and class mobility. The findings provide new understandings of the complexity of Chinese masculinity in the dating show context, which reflects the influence of capitalist globalization on the one hand, and the government’s attempt to govern public conduct and morality on the other.",0,1
"Catalan lexicography has traditionally dealt with idioms either as alphabetically ordered lemmas or as non-lemmatic stems. In the case of a non-lemmatic approach, idioms are registered using either the first word with semantic content or the word considered to reflect the main semantic content of the expression. This paper shows that both traditional semasiologic and onomasiologic approaches to the description of idioms have been unified in a new conceptual dictionary of Catalan idioms. This dictionary introduces detailed grammatical, linguistic, and conceptual information for each idiomatic expression. In addition, a CD-ROM is provided, which allows any search combination using the query boxes of the dictionary's data base previously built up. The present paper describes the innovations this dictionary presents, and focuses on the selection of concepts, the specification of cross-referential conceptual relationships among idiomatic expressions, and the advantages it has over other dictionaries in teaching and learning idioms.",0,1
"Przedstawione w artykule wyniki analizy akustycznej opisujączęstotliwość, z jakąmiędzywokaliczna głoska [w] jest usuwana ze strumienia mowy. Analizie poddano wypowiedzi 20 rodzimych użytkowników języka polskiego, których poproszono o opowiedzenie fabuły filmu, w którym głównąpostaciąjest kobieta. Wyniki analizy akustycznej wskazują, że w ok. 25% przypadków międzywokaliczne [w] nie jest wymawiane, jeśli stanowi element końcówki fleksyjnej czasownika, np. -ała, -iła, -yła. W takich przypadkach trajektorie formantów, jak równieżich intensywność, nie wskazywały na obecnośćpółsamogłoski [w] pomiędzy samogłoskami lub zmiany te były tak niewielkie, że nie wywoływały akustycznego wrażenia głoski [w].

ABSTRACT This paper reports the results of an acoustic study concerned with deletion of intervocalic [w] in contemporary Polish. The data for analysis were obtained by asking twenty monolingual native speakers of Polish, ten males and ten females, to tell the story of a film or a book whose protagonist was female. The results revealed that approximately 25% of the sound combinations in question were reduced phonetically to a vowel geminate. In cases of deletion, the formant trajectories of the examined sound sequences either did not show any signs of the glide or the expected drop in formant frequencies throughout the glide section is so slight that it is rather unlikely to produce an auditory impression of a [w] sound. Importantly, in the analysed recordings, w-dropping affects only the glide elements found in various verb forms, while intervocalic [w] appears to be resistant to deletion in the few cases where the glide constitutes an element of the stem, e.g. in the nouns skała ‘rock’and szkoła ‘school’.",0,1

The article describes the FCAA development project and evaluates the strengths and weaknesses of the new test and the whole testing system, often with reference to the framework of test usefulness proposed by Bachman and Palmer (1996). The quality of the overall system in Finland appears to be quite variable as it is based on the principle of decentralization, in which the FCAA evaluates and approves different tests to be used for certifying the English language skills of aviation personnel. On the other hand, the FCAA commissioned the creation of a test of its own, which appears to have certain strengths, but also has some flaws, such as a lack of systematic double rating of speaking and very little centralized monitoring of overall quality.",0,1

"After comments with laudatory and clarifying intent on the Chomskyan revolution, I make some critical remarks on Eörs Szathmáry's views on the evolution of language and its relation to the brain. This is followed by a brief sketch of the theory of one-dimensional syntax in the biolinguistic context, leading to the conclusion that the item-organizing specificity of human language may not be due to a qualitative change in narrow syntactic ability. This unique property may instead be a consequence of the possession of an interpretive module capable of parallel processing of numerous simple one-dimensional syntactic structures – which individually have no more configurational complexity than birdsong.",0,1
"In 1928 the Polish anthropologist Jan Czekanowski published in the ethnographical quarterly Lud' a study of the Indo-European languages in which he employed the method of differential diagnosis by quantitative correlation determinations which he had long been using with success in physical anthropology and ethnography. This method, whatever its field, rests upon the recognition of isolable and definable features or traits, which we shall hereafter refer to as elements, whose presence or absence can be determined for a number of populational groups or territorial entities, such as races, tribes, cultures, castes, or, in the present study, languages. The distribution of these is tabulated in terms of plus for presence in a particular group, minus for absence, and the question mark for unknown. Then each group is compared with each of the other groups in terms of the four-cell segregation familiar to statisticians. That is to say, four values are determined: a represents the number of elements common to both groups, b the number present in the first but absent in the second, c the number absent in the first but present in the second, and d the number absent in both. In other words, a and d are agreements, positive and negative respectively; b and c are disagreements. These four values are then substituted in a suitable formula, and a coefficient of similarity between the two groups results. When the coefficients for each pair of the groups being considered are assembled, we get a classification of the relative degrees of",0,1
"Reviewed by: Abstract Phonology in a Concrete Model: Cognitive Linguistics and the Morphology-Phonology Interface Frank Y. Gladney Tore Nesset. Abstract Phonology in a Concrete Model: Cognitive Linguistics and the Morphology-Phonology Interface. Berlin: Mouton de Gruyter, 2008. pp. x, 250. [Cognitive Linguistics Research, 40.] The book is narrowly focused on stem alternations in the Russian verb, as in pisa-l ‘wrote’ ~ piš-et ‘writes’. Nesset’s central claim is that /a/ ~ /Ø/ truncation and /s/ ~ /š/ softening constitute a conspiracy which has the meaning here of [PRESENT]. His broader purpose is to argue that Cognitive Grammar (CG) accounts for Russian verbal morphophonemics better than other frameworks. There are 12 chapters. Chapter 1 states the book’s main argument, that CG accommodates the “morphology-phonology interface” and that morphophonemic alternations are meaningful. Chapter 2 presents the CG linguist’s “toolbox” (represented mainly as boxes and arrows). Chapter 3 is about the CG approach to Russian phonemes and allophones. Chapter 4 presents verbal stem alternations. Chapter 5 claims that CG provides a synthesis of the phonologically based one-stem description and the semantically based two-stem description. Chapter 6 treats infinitives, the straightforward pisa-t’, the morphophonemically more complex gres-ti (~ greb-u), and the hard-to-segment peč’ (~ pek-u). Chapter 7 treats past-tense forms, the problem of soxla (~ soxnut’) losing -nu-, of vel (~ vedu) losing -d-, and of nes (~ nesla) losing -/. Chapter 8 is on the imperative and the problem of opacity, igrajte being opaque because the j doesn’t truncate before a consonant and bros’ because suffixal -i- does truncate even though the conditioning vowel ending does not appear. Chapter 9 is on palatalization and lenition. Kupit’ ~ kuplju is said to show lenition because /pl’/ ends in a continuant and prjatat’ ~ prjaču because [č’] “does not have a complete closure” (174). Chapter 10 is about opacity and non-modularity. Pišet is opaque because the suffix in pisa- which conditions the transitive softening of š is absent from this form. Non-modularity refers to the claim that CG handles forms like pišet effectively because it does not require separate morphology and phonology modules. Chapter 11 is titled “The [End Page 311] meaning of alternations: The truncation-softening conspiracy.” Chapter 12 is concluding remarks. The key principle of CG is the so-called Content Requirement, namely, that language consists solely in sound, meaning, and their symbolic association. Grammar is the network of schemas and their elaborations (or extensions). At the semantic pole, [DOG], for example, is schematic for its elaboration [POODLE] as well as for its metaphorical extension to [INFERIOR PRODUCT], [UNATTRACTIVE PERSON], etc., while itself being an elaboration of [ANIMAL], which in turn is an elaboration of [CREATURE], ultimately of [THING]. Proceeding downward into specificity, poodle can be more narrowly categorized as my poodle, my sister’s poodle, and the poodle that kept me awake last night by barking. In this way words categorize phrases, which categorize clauses, which categorize complex sentences and even discourses. At the phonetic pole, phonemes are schematic for allophones, while allophones are schematic for their various realizations. An important postulate of CG is that everything above the phoneme level is meaningful, including, in the above examples, ‘s, the, that, by, and -ing. This may be what underlies the author’s claim that morphophonemic alternations also have meaning. CG has been most fully worked out for expressions at the word level and higher. In the most recent exposition, Langacker 2008, sublexical matters are dealt with on only a few of its 540 pages. This puts Nesset at a slight disadvantage in applying CG to Russian verbal morphophonemics. An example of how CG handles verbal morphology is provided by the forms seeded and sat. Langacker (1987: 340) presents each as an elaboration of the schema [VERB-PAST]. Seed-ed elaborates it straightforwardly, sat less so. How to handle the [PAST] component of sat is a problem that has been around for a while. Chomsky and Halle (1968: 11) regard [PAST] as an abstract morpheme which is sometimes realized as -ed and sometimes deleted in favor of a readjustment rule that effects ablaut changes like /i/ /æ/. But abstract morphemes and syntactic features are ruled out in CG...",0,1

"The purpose of the present paper is to theorize the relationship between bilingualism and gender within a feminist post structuralist framework. I suggest that all language contact phenomena, including bilingualism, acquire different meanings indifferent contexts and can be linked to gender only indirectly. In some contexts, where bilingual skills are highly valued, they may become a means for one group to dominate the other, while in others bilingualism and cultural mediation are constructed as “servile” occupations and assigned to the less powerful group. Depending on gender relations in minority and majority communities, the values and benefits of monolingualism and bilingualism may be different for men and women. In some situations, knowledge of the majority language would be useful to everyone in the community, in others, the majority language is more useful for men than for women, and yet in others, it is women who profit most by shifting to the majority language. In sum, it is argued that it is not the essential nature of femininity or masculinity that defines the patterns of bilingualism, language maintenance or language shift, but rather the nature of gender, social, and economic relations, and ideologies of language and gender that mediate these relations.",0,1

"ON THE MAKING OF THE MIDDLE ENGLISH DICTIONARY Sherman M. Kuhn The external history of the Middle English Dictionary is sufficiently well known. Down to the year 1954, it is available in the Plan and Bibliography fascicle of the MED; while the simple annals after 1954 can be extracted from the published parts, A-M: the comings and goings of editors, associate editors, assistant editors, subeditors, editorial assistants, and compositors, with the dates and content of the various facicles as published. In April of the year 1975, a very generous grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, designed to supplement the continuing support of the University of Michigan and the Horace H. Rackham Foundation, enabled the MED to hire seven new full-time assistant editors, together with additional compositors and editorial assistants. This has resulted in nearly tripling the size of our editorial staff and approximately doubling the number of those concerned with putting the edited copy in final form for publication. [There have been further events of historical interest since 1975, when the above was written.We are now editing S and publishing P. The National Endowment for the Humanities made a large grant to the MED in 1980, which has enabled us to repair the ravages of inflation and to make some improvements in staff and equipment . After working with the MED for some time informally, Professor Robert E. Lewis from Indiana University joined the staff of the MED on August 1 , 1982, as Co-Editor. He will, D.V. , take over the Editorship when the present incumbent retires in 1983. I wish to add one further comment. While the MED, since 1930, has been a project of The University of Michigan and a plurality of the staff received their training at this university, the MED is by no means parochial: it has drawn scholars (and ideas) from many sources. The fourteen Ph.D's presently working on the dictionary represent the following universities (besides Michigan): California at Berkeley, Chicago, Glasgow, Harvard, London, This essay was originally published in Poética: An International Journal ofLinguistic-Literary Studies 4 (1976). We are grateful to the editors ofthat journal and to Sherman M. Kuhn for permission to reprint it here. 14 Sherman M. Kuhn15 Pennsylvania, Texas, and Wisconsin. If we add to these Associate and Assistant Editors who have served limited appointments or have retired or resigned, the list would include Iowa, Leeds, Lund, Northwestern, Oregon, Queen's (Belfast), Stanford, Toronto, Washington, and Yale.] It is the internal history of the MED which will comprise the remainder of this paper: the stages in the preparation of the dictionary and some of the principles governing our methods and procedures. In order to keep the length of the discussion within reasonable bounds, I shall confine myself as far as possible to a few matters of some general interest: answers to questions which friends and users of the MED most frequently ask me, criticisms leveled at this dictionary by reviewers, and problems often debated within the MED staff itself. The first stage in the making of a dictionary is the limitation of its field. The problem is simplest for the lexicographer working in a contemporary language; but even he must decide which outmoded words are to be included under the label ""archaic"" and which are to be excluded, whether any areas or dialects or technical words are to be excluded as not being in the main stream of the language, and what neologisms are to be omitted because they seem too new or faddish and unlikely to establish themselves in the language. For the maker of a historical, or period, dictionary, the problem is more complicated; he must decide what period of the language he shall cover, where that period shall begin and end, what the geographical limits, if any, of his field must be, and whether any special vocabularies or dialects should be excluded. The decisions made by the MED, with the reasoning behind them, may be of assistance to other lexicographers faced with problems similar to ours. Old English gradually turned into Middle English during the late eleventh and early twelfth centuries. No matter where one draws the line between these...",0,1

"Reviewed by: La versification by Jean-Michel Gouvard Hélène Perdicoyianni-Paléologou La versification. By Jean-Michel Gouvard. Paris: Presses Universitaires de France, 1999. Pp. 305. In this manual, Jean-Michel Gouvard’s intention is to give a synoptic presentation of the latest studies on versification. True to its intention, the book lays out developments over the past twenty years. G follows faithfully the traditional division appearing in various manuals dealing with versification: The first three chapters focus on verse study, while the other three engage in an examination of strophes. The first two chapters study vowels and accent, respectively, which define the metre of a verse. G takes into account the latest contributions in phonology in order to describe the structure of syllables and accentuation. In the third chapter, G attempts a historical and theoretical presentation of various metres between one and seventeen syllables. He first examines various types of simple verses, then a number of compound verses, and lastly, the occurrence of caesura in French poetry. Ch. 4 constitutes an introduction to the study of strophe and deals with the definition of rhyme and its various avatars over the past centuries. G seeks to identify numerical vowels and metrical accent as a means of measuring the metre of a verse and of highlighting the modalities by which verses are paired with each other, by means of rhyme. In the fifth chapter, G cites, from a historical and theoretical point of view, the main strophical forms of French literature and highlights the ruptures and continuities from the Middle Ages to the present day. He examines the modalities of rhythmical combinations of some principal strophes in French poetry by drawing up a typology and specifying the historical role of all forms. The last chapter completes the preceding one by examining the factors introducing formal variations in a strophe and/or a poem. These factors are: change of the length of verses; strophical alternation, which is applied to a poem comprising at least two types of distinct strophes; alternation in gender designating the processes of rule in masculine and feminine rhymes within a strophe and/or a poem. The chapter ends with an examination of vers libre, as it was applied in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and from the end of the nineteenth century to our times. G thus prepares himself to describe less regular poetical forms than those examined in the whole manual. The work emphasizes several aspects of French versification and discloses the main rules of verses and strophes. It is a well structured work and so recommended for students of French poetry and readers with an interest in the analysis and history of poetical forms.

"Abstract Children's ability to reflect upon and manipulate the sounds in words (“phonological awareness”) develops as part of natural language acquisition, supports reading acquisition, and develops further as reading and spelling are learned. Children with developmental dyslexia typically have impairments in phonological awareness. Many developmental factors contribute to individual differences in phonological development. One important source of individual differences may be the child's sensory/neural processing of the speech signal from an amplitude modulation (~energy or intensity variation) perspective, which may affect the quality of the sensory/neural representations (“phonological representations”) that support phonological awareness. During speech encoding, brain electrical rhythms (oscillations, rhythmic variations in neural excitability) recalibrate their temporal activity to be in time with rhythmic energy variations in the speech signal. The accuracy of this neural alignment or “entrainment” process is related to speech intelligibility. Recent neural studies demonstrate atypical oscillatory function at slower rates in children with developmental dyslexia. Potential relations with the development of phonological awareness by children with dyslexia are discussed.",0,1

"Nous nous appuyons sur les donnees du francais pour etudier les proprietes des adverbes en fonction d'ajouts incidents (ou plus simplement, adverbes incidents), et ce qui les oppose a celles des adverbes ordinaires, integres ; puis nous montrons brievement comment ils peuvent etre pris en compte dans une grammaire. L'incidence est une propriete des occurrences, et non des items lexicaux : il n'y a donc pas de correlation avec des classes semantiques ou un fonctionnement pragmatique specifiques. Les adverbes incidents peuvent etre ou non parenthetiques, c'est-a-dire ne pas contribuer ou contribuer au contenu principal de la proposition. Il s'agit d'un statut prosodique (bien que leur realisation phonetique ne soit pas unique), correle a des proprietes syntaxiques et des proprietes de portee. Crucialement, les adverbes incidents ne peuvent pas etre consideres comme etant hors du champ de la grammaire, car leur occurrence est syntaxiquement contrainte : ils n'apparaissent pas a l'interieur d'un constituant majeur de la phrase (sauf a l'interieur du syntagme verbal), et toutes les positions ne sont pas egalement ouvertes aux adverbes incidents et integres. De plus, l'incidence a un correlat semantique, en ce que, contrairement a ce qui se passe pour les adverbes integres, leur portee n'est pas contrainte par leur position. Nous adoptons un modele de grammaire syntagmatique, qui distingue entre une structure tectogrammaticale (pour la constituance et les fonctions) et une structure phenogrammaticale (pour l'ordre des constituants). Dans cette perspective, ils sont analyses comme des ajouts a la phrase, qui sont linearises librement au debut ou a la fin de la phrase, ou entre les constituants majeurs.",0,1

But our work is distinct from his in that we model how this source of information interacts with compositional and lexical semantics. We formalize bridging in a framework known as SDRT (Asher 1993). We demonstrate that this provides a richer, more accurate interpretation of definite descriptions than has been offered so far.",0,1

"The article exemplifies and presents the characteristics of linguistic imperialism, linguistic capital accumulation following the same pattern as capitalist economic dominance. The text summarizes the way English was established in the colonial period. Many of the mechanisms of linguistic hierarchy have been maintained and intensified since then, as African and Indian scholarship demonstrates. Language plays a key role in education, the World Bank taking over where colonial regimes left off. Anglo-American efforts to maintain global English dominance have intensified since 1945 and are central to the present-day world ‘order’, as the postcolonial is subsumed under global empire, assisted by English linguistic neoimperialism. Some scholars who deny the existence of linguistic imperialism are reported on, and the complexity of language policy in European integration is demonstrated. The article concludes by setting out how the deceptive term ‘lingua franca’ needs to be challenged, and lists ways of exploring English as project, process, and product, setting out key research questions. The constraints of a short article only permit glimpses of a rapidly evolving scene, the visible tip of the English iceberg.",0,1

"Sentiment analysis is a classification task where polarity of textual data is identified, i.e. to analyze whether a sentence or document expresses a negative, positive or neutral sentiment. Manipuri is a less privileged, highly agglutinative and tonal language. Despite being a scheduled language of Indian Constitution, it is also a resource constrained language. In this work, we report the sentiment analysis for Manipuri using different types of machine learning based approaches. The dataset used in our work is collected from local daily newspaper. The novelty of this work is that we carry out language specific pre-processing tasks such as transliteration, building negative morpheme based lexicon and filtering of noisy words. Using them as additional linguistic features in our models improves the classification result in terms of precision, recall and F-score. The ensemble voting of best three classifiers based on TF-IDF perform better than BM25 based classifiers and other stand-alone classifiers.

"How do proper names refer? This question about reference is critical for philosophers studying language, linguists investigating meaning and reference, and psycholinguists interested in how children acquire names. Over the past century, philosophers have put forward two classical theories to explain the link between a name and the entity it refers to, i.e., the descriptivist theory proposed by Frege (1892/1948), Russell (1905) and Searle (1958) among others, and the causal-historical view most notably advocated by Kripke (1980). On the former account, a name gets its referent through associated definite descriptions. Thus, when a speaker uses a name, they typically refer to whoever best fits the descriptive content attached to that name. For instance, the name “Kamala Harris” refers to the lady Kamala Harris because she is the sole individual who could uniquely satisfy the descriptive content “the first female vice president of the United States” that is commonly...",0,1
"Abstract Cognitive Grammar has emerged in recent years to become an established analytical method in cognitive stylistics. Although one of its key affordances is that it provides a robust framework for analysing the different ways in which scenes can be depicted, researchers have yet to develop an account of how Cognitive Grammar can support a detailed analysis of authorial creativity. This paper aims to redress the balance by using Cognitive Grammar to examine the relationship between creativity and the unique situations that give rise to writing in a diary entry and two subsequent rewritings of that entry by the First World War poet and soldier Siegfried Sassoon. The paper combines ideas on contextual constraints with a text-driven, Cognitive Grammar-oriented analysis to demonstrate how a contextualized approach highlights the ways in which Sassoon’s writing is motivated by particular physical, social and cultural environments. These include the interaction with and reconfiguration of the material body within the physical setting of the military trench.",0,1

"Adults find negative sentences difficult to process, but an informative context can facilitate processing substantially, suggesting that much of this difficulty may come from the pragmatics of negation. Are children sensitive to the pragmatics of negation as well? Although children perform poorly on many tests of negation comprehension, we argue that these past findings are due to children’s sensitivity to general pragmatic principles that govern communication, rather than the conceptual difficulty of negation. In Experiment 1, replicating previous work, we found that adults rated negative sentences as more felicitous in more informative contexts. In Experiment 2, we showed that children are also sensitive to the contexts of true negative sentences, with three- and four-year-olds also rating true negative sentences higher in more informative contexts. We discuss children’s understanding of negation and pragmatics in light of these results, arguing that the felicity of negative sentences for both adults and children is determined by the informativeness of these sentences in context.",0,1

"The analysis of juror cognition requires a distinction between evidence comprehension and verdict computation. Some investigators have assumed that verdict choice depends upon properties of the evidence base rather than upon the outcome of the application of a verdict algorithm to that evidence base. The evidence bases developed by eight members of a guilty‐verdict group and six members of an innocent‐verdict group for a medical malpractice case were compared using multidimensional scaling procedures. INDSCAL and HICLUS solutions for the relatedness rankings of twelve evidence elements for the two groups of undergraduates were virtually indistinguishable at an initial session and one four days later. No dimension of the two‐ or three‐dimensional INDSCAL solutions was differentially salient for members of the guilty‐verdict group. Verdict‐related differences between these mock jurors only emerged in response to instructions at the second session to simulate the evidence base of members of the opposite verdict group. These data imply that jurors arriving at different verdict conclusions differ in the way they compute verdicts from a common evidence base rather than in the structure of their evidence bases. Some limitations of these findings are considered, and it is concluded that the legal system's distinction between evidence comprehension and verdict deliberation is a defensible one.",0,1
"System evaluation has mattered since research on automatic language and information processing began. However, the (D)ARPA conferences have raised the stakes substantially in requiring and delivering systematic evaluations and in sustaining these through long term programmes; and it has been claimed that this has both significantly raised task performance, as defined by appropriate effectiveness measures, and promoted relevant engineering development. These controlled laboratory evaluations have made very strong assumptions about the task context. The paper examines these assumptions for six task areas, considers their impact on evaluation and performance results, and argues that for current tasks of interest, e.g. summarising, it is now essential to play down the present narrowly-defined performance measures in order to address the task context, and specifically the role of the human participant in the task, so that new measures, of larger value, can be developed and applied.",0,1
"In this paper, we propose a word sense learning algorithm which is capable of unsupervised feature selection and cluster number identification. Feature selection for word sense learning is built on an entropy-based filter and formalized as a constraint optimization problem, the output of which is a set of important features. Cluster number identification is built on a Gaussian mixture model with a MDL-based criterion, and the optimal model order is inferred by minimizing the criterion. To evaluate closeness between the learned sense clusters with the ground-truth classes, we introduce a kind of weighted F-measure to model the effort needed to reconstruct the classes from the clusters. Experiments show that the algorithm can retrieve important features, roughly estimate the class numbers automatically and outperforms other algorithms in terms of the weighted F-measure. In addition, we also try to apply the algorithm to a specific task of adding new words into a Chinese thesaurus.",0,1
"This article explores the interfaces between two constructs in linguistics and psychotherapy—metaphor and the human body—as a means of illustrating meaningful exchange between linguistic and mental health research. Three distinctly well-motivated research strands with underexplored overlaps: (a) the theoretical relationship between metaphor and the body, (b) the use and management of metaphors in therapy, and (c) the body as a therapeutic resource complementing verbal interaction, are first described. Taking a practitioner-informed approach called “correspondent analysis,” which combines the methods and insights of the metaphor researcher and psychotherapist, a series of session extracts are then analyzed to illustrate the connections between the three strands and what they imply for both metaphor research and therapeutic practice. This culminates in the proposal of a triangle model for the metaphor–body–psychotherapy relationship, with wider implications for applied metaphor research also discussed.",0,1

"Over the past decades, the language management discourse in South Africa has focused on the development and intellectualization of the functional status of indigenous African languages in high-status domains. African languages are marginalized despite the existence of various empowering and restorative legislative provisions and policies of the new democratic dispensation. Of particular interest in this paper are the challenges that affect the localization of information and communication technologies in the higher education domain. The reliance mostly on former colonial languages for the transmission of knowledge in education has had a negative impact on the development and intellectualization of these languages. It has been argued that Information and Communication Technology (ICT) localization has the potential of improving information access in indigenous languages which can further facilitate the maximum utilization and development of these languages. The promotion of African languages and their use in scientific domains is critical in addressing historical linguistic inequalities and injustices in the South African higher education sector. In this paper, I argue that the dynamics associated with the connection between macro and micro level language management, and some socio-linguistic and socio-cultural factors affect the ultimate goal of achieving language management goals associated with ICT localization.",0,1
"This article raises a number of questions that should be dealt with in drawing up a lexicographic plan for Gabon. For which of the Gabonese languages should lexicographic units be established? This question entrains the issue of inventorying the Gabonese languages and their standardization as well as the issue of language planning for Gabon. What is the status of those foreign languages widely spoken in Gabon? What about French? Should Gabon keep importing its French dictionaries from France, or should the Gabonese compile their own French dictionaries, including French words and expressions exclusively used in Gabon? Finally, after trying to answer these questions, a number of suggestions are made for the establishment of a lexicographic plan for Gabon. Keywords: gabonese language landscape (GLL), lexicographic plan for gabon, language diversity, language policy, language standardization, gabonese lexicography, national language, native languages, foreign languages",0,1
"T HERE IS a passage in the book of Ecclesiastes that might qualify as every scholar's favorite biblical text. It runs: Of the making of many books, there is no end, and much study is a weariness to the flesh. Be it as it may with books, those of us who study vocabulary will surely agree that at least of the making of many words there is no end. Sounds change unobtrusively. We awake one morning to discover that medals for bravery are made of the metal (medal) silver, that hardy explorers receive a hearty (hardy) welcome, that the latter (ladder) of two things may be a ladder to climb, and that ts and ds, in certain positions, have ceased to be distinguished by many of our fellow countrymen. When did that sound change happen? It is hard to say. Suddenly it was there-to the interest of linguists and the alarm of purists. By the time we observe a sound change, it has already happened and is well established.",0,1
"Bilingual or even polylingual word embeddings created many possibilities for tasks involving multiple languages. While some tasks like cross-lingual information retrieval aim to satisfy users’ multilingual information needs, some enable transferring valuable information from resource-rich languages to resource-poor ones. In any case, it is important to build and evaluate methods that operate in a cross-lingual setting. In this paper, Wordnet definitions in 7 different languages are used to create a semantic textual similarity testbed to evaluate cross-lingual textual semantic similarity methods. A document alignment task is created to be used between Wordnet glosses of synsets in 7 different languages. Unsupervised textual similarity methods—Wasserstein distance, Sinkhorn distance and cosine similarity—are compared with a supervised Siamese deep learning model. The task is modeled both as a retrieval task and an alignment task to investigate the hubness of the semantic similarity functions. Our findings indicate that considering the problem as a retrieval and alignment problem has a detrimental effect on the results. Furthermore, we show that cross-lingual textual semantic similarity can be used as an automated Wordnet construction method.",0,1
"Nahuatl has a long history of contact with, and marginalization by, Spanish. Today the language shift maintains a steady pace, despite numerous initiatives for revitalization and revalorization. This paper deals with the lexical creativity of Nahuatl speakers. As a result of the fieldwork of our research team in six communities in Mexico, we have amassed rich data concerning neologisms that designate objects and concepts imported from European culture. Unlike most studies on language contact in Nahuatl, we choose to focus not on the morphosyntactic strategies of lexicogenesis, or on phenomena of matter and/or pattern borrowing, but on the conceptual structure of neologisms, applying the onomasiological theory of word-formation. We argue that, while language endangerment and the lack of an obvious need for lexicogenesis may cause some productivity patterns to go dormant, these do not necessarily become eradicated. Moreover, innovative patterns of word-formation may come to light when lexical creativity is triggered.",0,1

"Communication research typically involves participant recruitment of individuals with a communication disability. However, such recruitment can be particularly difficult due to the social isolation and communication difficulties that are inherent to this population. As such, the Communication Research Registry (CRR) was established. The current study aimed to: (1) identify the motivations of individuals with a communication disability for joining the CRR and participating in communication research; (2) explore research experiences of CRR members; and (3) determine research areas of importance to CRR members. Answers to these research questions are needed to facilitate research recruitment and positive research experiences for people with communication disability. Online or paper surveys containing a mix of open- and closed-ended questions were completed by 89 adults with a communication disability. Qualitative content analysis of participant responses identified two main themes responsible for motivating adults to join the CRR, including: (1) altruistic motivators; and (2) personal motivators. The majority of participants reported having had positive research experiences through the CRR, and identified a range of potential research areas they would like further investigated. The study findings are not only important for expanding and improving the CRR and research registries more broadly, but are relevant to all communication researchers who endeavour to include individuals with a communication disability in research and facilitate meaningful research experiences. Furthermore, the results offer support for the CRR in addressing barriers to recruitment and facilitating access and inclusion of people with a communication disability in research.",0,1
"This paper builds on previous research into the making of the English Dialect Dictionary: Thompson (2006), Markus (2009), Beal (2010), among others. It examines the contribution of Bishop White Kennett’s unpublished Etymological Collections of English Words and Provincial Expressions (1690s), also known as MS Lansd. 1033, to Joseph Wright’s dictionary. The paper applies quantitative methods of analysis in order to ascertain the proportion of words which were illustrated by means of Kennett’s data, and to assess the treatment that Wright gave to them. Also, the paper attempts to show the important information contained in Kennett’s document, arguing that it is a valid resource for regional dialect investigation. In doing so, there is hope that this paper may cast some light upon the documentary structure of the English Dialect Dictionary, and contribute to our understanding of the documents that were taken as testimonies to Late Modern English dialects.",0,1

"Respiratory muscle strength training is a paradigm that has been used for numerous years with a variety of populations including but not limited to spinal cord injury, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, voice disordered, sedentary elderly, and healthy young. The respiratory muscle strength program discussed here is an expiratory muscle strength training and uses a pressure threshold device with a regimented treatment protocol. The primary purpose of the expiratory muscle strength training program is to promote strength in the expiratory muscles. The training protocol occurs five times per day, 5 days a week, and consists of ~15-20 minutes per day of training by the user at home. The device threshold is changed weekly by a clinician to maintain a threshold load of 75% of an individual's maximum expiratory pressure. The threshold setting of the device is always based on the individual's recorded maximum expiratory pressure generated into a digital pressure gauge. Results of 4 weeks of expiratory muscle strength training protocols indicate up to a 50% improvement for healthy subjects, those with multiple sclerosis, and those with spinal cord injury. The potential transfer of expiratory muscle strength to functional outcomes is discussed, as well as how strength-training paradigms may influence cortical plasticity.",0,1

"This article reviews corpus-based Chinese studies, both applied and theoretical, from the 1920s to the present. It will be shown that, while corpus-based Chinese studies have been gaining momentum for only the last couple of decades, the roots of Chinese corpus linguistics go all the way back to the beginning of the 20th century. Today the bulk of corpus-based Chinese studies is oriented toward applied linguistics, with the compilation of frequency character/word lists and interlanguage Chinese studies being the most popular types of research. In addition to applied linguistic studies, this overview also highlights some innovative corpus studies on lexical and grammatical aspects of both classical and modern Chinese, as well as studies of sociolinguistic variation and discourse pragmatics. Overall, important groundwork in Chinese corpus linguistics is acknowledged and future directions are discussed.",0,1
"Partee (2009) conjectures a formal semantics for natural language (hereafter, single-type semantics) that interprets CPs and referential DPs in the same semantic type: properties of situations. Partee’s semantics contrasts with Montague semantics and its recent contenders (dubbed dual- or multi-type semantics) which assume distinct basic types for the semantic values of referential DPs (i.e. individuals) and CPs (i.e. propositions, truth-values, or sets of assignment functions). Partee’s conjecture is motivated by results in event semantics and discourse representation theory, which support the indirect uni-directional shiftability between propositions and individuals. However, none of these results supports the identity of the types for individuals and propositions. Our paper improves upon the strength and scope of Partee’s support for single-type semantics. In particular, it identifies a number of new arguments for the adoption of single-type semantics which display this semantics’ greater unificatory and explanatory power. These arguments are based on the ability of single-type semantics to provide a uniform account of the distributional similarities between DPs and CPs, to explain the truth-evaluability of DP fragments, and to capture semantic inclusion relations between CPs and referential DPs. To further support single-type semantics, we defend it against a number of objections.",0,1

El presente ensayo analiza el empleo de la parodia en la poesía de Luis Hernández como una estrategia discursiva que ejecuta un doble juego diseminador: por un lado, desmitifica las convenciones vigentes en su época acerca de la poesía (y la palabra) como un arte sublime y acerca del autor como reducto último del significado; y, por otro lado, abre el campo de sentido para incorporar referentes culturales e intertextuales que disuelven, en la praxis poética, la división entre alta cultura y cultura de masas.",0,1
"Court reporters are certified at either 95% or 98% accuracy, depending on their certifying organization; however, the measure of accuracy is not one that evaluates their ability to transcribe nonstandard dialects. Here, we demonstrate that Philadelphia court reporters consistently fail to meet this level of transcription accuracy when confronted with mundane examples of spoken African American English (AAE). Furthermore, we show that they often cannot demonstrate understanding of what is being said. We show that the different morphosyntax of AAE, the different phonological patterns of AAE, and the different accents in Philadelphia related to residential segregation all conspire to produce transcriptions that not only are inaccurate, but also change the official record of who performed what actions under which circumstances, with potentially dramatic legal repercussions for everyday speakers of AAE.",0,1
"This paper traces recent theorisation stemming from the multilingual turn and brings this into dialogue with assemblage thinking, discussing the critical potential of bringing these perspectives together to explore what language is and how it is understood. The argument maps salient features of the multilingual turn which have extended the fields of applied and socio-linguistics beyond a preoccupation with separable languages embedded within a code-based depiction of linguistic behaviour. Within this body of research, we highlight the influential theoretical frames of (trans)languaging and metrolingualism, which position language as a dynamic process – and practice – rather than a product. We then begin to think through language/languaging as assemblage, a process which heralds an ontological shift. In so doing, we consider the ontological turn within and beyond linguistics to extend the potential of critical language studies, breaking with hegemonic language ideology via a radical reconsideration of the temporality, complexity and materiality of language.",0,1
"The ability to understand and produce language is unique to humans, but at the same time, language processing is influenced by additional cognitive processes that other species share. Language may be described as a set of linguistic representations and rules, but it is other cognitive abilities, such as attention and short-term memory, that enable us to access and use those representations in verbal communication. In this role, these “other” cognitive processes are termed “language control” processes. Further, a substantial amount of research links language impairments to impairments of these “control” processes. This view of language abilities and language impairments has important implications for the rehabilitation of language disorders. It assumes that language impairment in aphasia reflects impaired access to linguistic representations rather than loss of language knowledge. Such a perspective allows consideration of treatment hypotheses that emphasize both language content (e.g., semantic or phonological variables) and access to that content (e.g., using priming techniques or focusing on short-term memory for language). Furthermore, this view is in keeping with recent research on factors that will maximize effectiveness of treatment, including style of training (e.g., errorless versus errorful learning[1]) and intensity and duration of treatment.[2]",0,1

"Philosophical considerations regarding experiential spatial content have focused on exteroceptive sensations presenting external entities, and not on interoceptive experiences that present states of our own body.

This article investigates whether a similarly rich spatial content can be attributed to experiences of acute, cutaneous pain. It is argued that such experiences of pain do not have field‐like content, as they do not present distance relations between painful sensations.",0,1
"The collective grave from Azraq 18 in Jordan provides an exceptional case-study of Natufian burial treatment from a site outside what was traditionally regarded as the core settlement area of the Mediterranean zone. Despite the bones being in a poor state of preservation, the meticulous excavation and recording of the material from the burial pit permits the reconstruction of the funerary treatment of each individual and of the history of the collective burial feature through time. Through detailed osteological analysis, techniques for unravelling the formation processes involved in the creation of the commingled assemblage of bones are presented. These aid reconstruction of burial practices and the subsequent secondary handling of the skeletal remains. Amongst the collective graves known from the Natufian, Azraq 18 provides some of the best information on the various steps involved in their creation. In addition, two crania show traces of pigmentation attesting to elaborate and rare secondary treatment of skeletal material in Natufian contexts.",0,1

"Brief response to Müller Benjamin Bruening 1. Introduction Stefan Müller (2018) criticizes my article, ‘The lexicalist hypothesis: Both wrong and superfluous’ (Bruening 2018), on several grounds. I go through each of his criticisms here and show that none weaken the arguments I made. The point of the original paper is undiminished, and the lexicalist hypothesis should be rejected as empirically false and explanatorily inadequate. 2. Psycholinguistics and processing Müller (§2) criticizes a phrasal analysis of a nominalization like God’s declaration of them to be wrong on the grounds of directionality. Because many phrase structure analyses build syntactic structures from the bottom up, he says, we would be required to have the VP declare them to be wrong before we get the nominalization declaration of them to be wrong. Since humans process language incrementally from left to right, according to Müller this account is therefore unworkable.1 However, the only justification that Müller gives for his claim is a reference to Fodor et al. 1974. This work is often cited for the conclusion that the derivational theory of complexity is incorrect and thus there is no evidence for a transformational approach to syntax. This is a mischaracterization of the psycholinguistics literature of the 1960s and 1970s. The literature of the time actually concluded very little, as did Fodor and colleagues (1974) themselves. For an in-depth discussion of that literature and what it did and did not show, see Phillips 1996:Ch. 5. Note also that there are many different views regarding possible connections between the grammar and the parser; in many of them, there is no contradiction at all between a model of syntax that builds structure bottom-to-top and a parser that parses structures left-to-right. See Phillips & Lewis 2013 for a detailed discussion of the different views and the issues (and evidence) involved. Rather than discuss these issues, I would like to discuss a comparison case. Compare the nominalization at issue, God’s declaration of them to be wrong, with the corresponding gerund, his declaring them to be wrong. The syntactic literature has universally concluded that gerunds include a full VP structure, because they can have VP elements like negation, auxiliaries, accusative case, and adverbs, as in his not having declared them so vehemently to be wrong (was viewed as a tacit endorsement). In a left-to-right processing model, the parser, upon encountering declaring in his declaring them to be wrong, will have to anticipate and begin building a full VP, even though declaring is category N.2 This is simply going to be necessary, in any model, if parsing takes place left-to-right (as it clearly does). Now, if the noun declaring in his declaring them to be wrong can cause the parser to build a full VP structure, why can’t the noun declaration in his declaration of them to be wrong? If the syntactic facts justify VP structure in a nominalization like declaration, as I and others have argued (Bruening 2017b and references [End Page e67] there), then this is what the parser must do. Given that the parser must be able to do it for a gerund, there is no reason to think that it cannot do it for a nominalization. Whatever view one adopts on the relation between the grammar and the parser, the model one proposes is going to have to allow something of category N to trigger the construction of VP structure. While some models might be ruled out if they cannot do this, there are many more that are compatible with left-to-right processing, even if they have a bottom-up syntax (again, see Phillips & Lewis 2013).3 3. Phrases inside derivation In §2.1 of my article, I argued that the lexicalist hypothesis is incorrect in its assertion that phrases cannot form the input to derivational morphology. I gave several examples of such cases, including phrases occurring inside compounds. Müller (§3) asserts that these are not a problem for the lexicalist hypothesis, because they are quotations. He repeats the quotation analysis from Wiese (1996), which I addressed at length in my article. According to...",0,1

"Die vorliegende Arbeit verfolgt das Ziel, das System der Prasensformenbildung in der serbokroatischen Schriftsprache nach Moglichkeit vollstandig zu beschreiben. Der Schwerpunkt des Interesses liegt dabei allerdings nicht so sehr auf dem ausgewahlten Gegenstandsbereich als solchem als vielmehr auf dem hier entwickelten deskriptiven Verfahren, das auch auf andere Bereiche der Formenbildung ubertragen werden kann. Dieses Verfahren, das in den folgenden Abschnitten ausfuhrlich erlautert wird, kann man als „analytischsyntetisch-funktionelle“ Methode bezeichnen. „Analytisch“ ist das Verfahren insofern zu nennen, als in einem ersten Schritt alle zur Bildung der Prasensformen verwendeten Ausdrucksmittel je fur sich erfast und dargestellt werden. Dieser erste Schritt macht von dem Verfahren der Abstraktion Gebrauch, insofern namlich, als davon abgesehen wird, das zur Bildung jeder Prasensform verschiedenartige Ausdrucksmittel zusammenwirken. „Synthetisch“ heist das Verfahren deshalb, weil wir im Anschlus an die Analyse der Frage nachgehen, welchen Regeln die Kombination der vorher je fur sich betrachteten Ausdrucksmitteln unterliegt, und weil wir danach fragen, welche Beziehungen zwischen den Tragern der nichtgrammatischen („lexikalischen“) und denen der grammatischen Bedeutungen bestehen. Auf dieser zweiten Etappe der Untersuchung steht die Beschreibung der Struktur des Systems der Prasensformenbildung im Mittelpunkt, wahrend auf der ersten Etappe die Elemente dieses Systems im Vordergrund stehen. „Funktionell“ konnen wir unser Verfahren deshalb nennen, weil wir durch das analytisch-synthetische Vorgehen in die Lage versetzt werden, die verschiedenen zur Bildung der Prasensformen eingesetzten Ausdrucksmittel funktionell zu bewerten. 1",0,1
"Reviewed by: Structures and beyond: The cartography of syntactic structuresed. by Adriana Belletti Günther Grewendorf Structures and beyond: The cartography of syntactic structures, vol. 3. Ed. by Adriana Belletti. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004. Pp. 288. ISBN 0195171969. $55. This volume grew out of a workshop held at the Certosa di Pontignano of the University of Siena. The workshop, which took place in connection with Noam Chomsky’s stay at the University of Siena during the fall of 1999, was part of the Cartographic Research Project, which deals with the hierarchical organization of language structure and aims at drawing fine-grained maps of clause structure, thereby identifying different types of structural positions. The present collection of the (revised) conference papers continues the series of cartographic volumes edited by Cinque (2002) and Rizzi (2004). Unlike its predecessors, which are specifically related to cartographic issues, Adriana Belletti’s volume connects the cartographic studies with other approaches to the study of language structure, and thus takes a wider perspective on current theoretical and experimental research on language. The articles of this volume, written by leading representatives of the field, relate the Cartographic Project to recent developments of Chomsky’s minimalist program, of Kayne’s antisymmetric approach, and of research into the syntax-semantic interface, as well as fundamental issues in experimental neurolinguistics and psycholinguistics. Although the articles are not grouped according to their topics but are given in alphabetical order by author, my review classifies them into three major research areas, and thus follows the organization of the instructive introduction written by Belletti. In the introduction, Belletti crucially points out that the apparent tension that seems to exist between the rich functional structures postulated by the Cartographic Project and the minimalist attempt to reduce structural complexity can in fact be taken to be merely apparent if the functional positions are all interpretable and thus do not conflict with the minimalist principle of full interpretation. There are three papers that deal with minimalist issues and questions of antisymmetric syntax. The chapter by N oamC homsky(‘Beyond explanatory adequacy’, 104–31) proceeds from the ‘biolinguistic’ assumption that the properties of the language L acquired by the child result from the interaction of three factors: (i) the genetically determined initial state S 0(also called the ‘universal grammar’); (ii) the individual experience (also called the ‘primary linguistic data’), which determines the transition from the initial state S 0to L; and, finally, (iii) general properties of organic systems. Since the faculty of language interacts with other organic systems such as the sensorimotor and the conceptual-intentional system, these systems impose ‘interface conditions’ [End Page 179]on this faculty that provide what Chomsky calls ‘the principled elements of S 0’ (106) and explain (‘beyond explanatory adequacy’) why the properties of language are the way they are. ‘Narrow syntax’ is based on the fundamental operations ‘external’ and ‘internal’ Merge, both conceptually motivated by requirements of the conceptual-intentional system: external Merge is a structure-building device for the generation of argument structures; internal Merge (movement) is motivated by nontheta-theoretic semantic conditions that concern scopal and discourse-related (informational) properties. Chomsky’s paper further provides interesting modifications and refinements of the theory of phases developed in Chomsky 2001. Phases are seen as those stages of the syntactic derivation where units constructed by the narrow syntax are transferred to the phonological and the semantic component, which then derive the interface representations <;PHON, SEM>. Since the latter are accessed by external organic systems, they have to satisfy a condition of ‘legibility’. Chomsky provides empirical and conceptual motivation for the assumption that all operations in narrow syntax (Agree, Movement, and Transfer) are driven by properties of the heads of phases and apply simultaneously. He furthermore answers the question of why these operations exist and shows that they can receive a principled explanation. In line with Chomsky’s elimination of Spec-Head agreement, M ichaelS tarke’s contribution (‘On the inexistence of specifiers and the nature of heads’, 252–68) argues for the inexistence of specifiers since specifiers redundantly contain the same features as heads and only ‘add space’ around heads. He tries to show that the head...",0,1
"This study examines the L2 acquisition and L1 attrition of preterite versus imperfect aspectual distinctions in Spanish among English-speaking L2 learners and long-term Spanish-speaking immigrants. Results from an acceptability judgment task and a truth value judgment task demonstrate significantly lower levels of target performance by both groups when compared to the control participants. The L2 learners outperform the native speakers undergoing attrition in some aspectual contexts, while in others both experimental groups show similar difficulties. To the extent that L2 learners and adult immigrants demonstrate comparable difficulties, L2 learners' deficits cannot be directly related to impairment reasons. L1 transfer of the semantic properties of tense heads offers a better explanation for the difficulties L2 learners often show in the aspectual domain.",0,1

The following analysis demonstrates that Vine racial comedy is heavily influenced by the generic features of African American stand‐up and sketch comedians and existing multimodal genres of online discourse, but King Bach's adaptation of these features to the unique affordances of the Vine platform situates Vine racial comedy beyond the boundaries of the genres it draws on. Analysis of this digitally mediated multimodal discourse demonstrates that, while not deterministic, the medium through which discourse is constructed can significantly impact how a discourse genre is conceptually understood by expanding the semiotic resources through which the sociopolitical and discursive goals that define a genre are accomplished.",0,1

Concluo que o escrevente se distancia da noção de estabilidade do gênero do discurso e se insere, numa tensão produtiva, no jogo discursivo da área, desvelando, de certa forma, dimensões ocultas das práticas de letramento(s) da esfera discursiva em que o gênero circula. Réplicas e alusões ou remissões a outros trabalhos são estratégias para validação da própria pesquisa e insumo para promover o próprio trabalho e proporcionar que ele seja futuramente citado.",0,1

"Desde sus orígenes, la Sociolingüística se desarrolló como una disciplina empeñada no solo en constatar y describir la variación lingüística, sino también en explicar la razón de su existencia, que, tal y como postuló López Morales (1989), se encuentra, en el fondo o en la superficie, en las creencias y actitudes de los individuos hacia un uso lingüístico concreto. A pesar de su importancia, no encontramos, por la dificultad que entraña su investigación, estudios de grandes dimensiones que nos permitan conocer un poco mejor el comportamiento lingüístico y comunicativo humano al respecto, que incide, además, en ámbitos como la adquisición de lenguas. Con objeto de llenar tal vacío, hemos emprendido un estudio de amplio alcance sobre actitudes hacia las variedades del español a través del Proyecto para el estudio de creencias y actitudes hacia las variedades del español en el siglo XXI (PRECAVES-XXI). En este trabajo, presentamos los procedimientos metodológicos ideados y utilizados para llevar a cabo la investigación, así como los primeros hallazgos, que demuestran, a pesar de tratarse de un primer acercamiento a partir de datos de castellanohablantes solo, que la valoración general de las variedades analizadas es positiva, especialmente en el componente afectivo; así mismo, se pone de manifiesto que las mayores diferencias en la valoración las obtiene la variedad andaluza, posiblemente por ser la que se percibe como más divergente.",0,1
"Every now and then one stumbles across complaints about the decaying state of the English language. British English is under threat from American English. English is dying or just on the verge of drawing its last breath. Recurring allegations similar to these are made by worried, albeit self-opinionated, speakers who are not only quick to declare the time of death of English, but also to point the finger at who they think is to blame for these developments. As part of my PhD project on usage attitudes in British English, I included the somewhat general question ‘What do you think about the state of the English language?” in an online questionnaire which was completed by 230 informants from Great Britain in order to obtain an insight into commonly held beliefs about British English. This particular question generated answers from 176 informants who shared their personal beliefs, or rather fears, about the state of the English language. In this article, I would like to share some of the insights gained through the preliminary analysis of these answers and invite you to contribute by completing a survey on this topic.",0,1

"Abstract In seeing a tilted penny, we are experientially aware of both its circularity and another shape, which I dub ‘β‐ellipticality’. Some claim that our experiential awareness of the intrinsic shapes/sizes of everyday objects depends upon our experiential awareness of β‐shapes/β‐sizes. In contrast, I maintain that β‐property experiences are the result of what Richard Wollheim calls ‘seeing‐in’, but run in reverse: instead of seeing a three‐dimensional object in a flat surface, we see a flat surface in a three‐dimensional object. Using this new account, I re‐examine the phenomenological directness of visual experience and undermine an argument for skepticism about β‐property experiences.",0,1

"The paper deals with the construction of race from the perspective of cognitive sociolinguistics. The focus is upon the perception of mixed-race people of black and white heritage in Poland and Germany compared to the USA, and its reflection in language use. The study clarifies in how far a socially marked perception of biracial people applies in these countries with very small population of black ancestry. Among other things, the first presidential campaign of Barack Obama is used to investigate the occurrence in both countries of mental colouring of biracial people. The paper also reflects the language debate on political correctness of the press language, sparked off by the presidential campaign and its media coverage. It presents claims and arguments by proponents of various solutions regarding referring to biracial people, and paradoxes showing up in the relationship between language use and ideological positions when the race issue is at stake.",0,1
"In the three years and seven months between the referendum on 23 June 2016 and 31 January 2020, when the UK officially left the European Union, there was much speculation over what status English would have in the EU after the withdrawal of the UK. It is now apparent that English has continued to flourish. This is supported by statistics for Member States which chart the extent to which English is a school subject. Well over 95% of the children in the EU are taught English as a mandatory subject. Official EU figures also show that 38% of the population is proficient in English as a second language, three times more than both French and German ( Special Eurobarometer 386: Europeans and their Languages , 2012). Moreover, although some, such as Danuta Hübner, EMP, wanted to question whether or not English could maintain its status as an official language in the EU, it is now apparent that it will not be possible to remove English in this respect (with changes requiring a unanimous vote in the Council, which Ireland has said it will not support [European Commission, 2016]), ( The Guardian 27 December 2019). English has also retained its position as one of the three ‘procedural’ or ‘working languages’ alongside French and German. This has taken place despite the fact that without the UK, no Member State has English as its official EU language, and only approximately one percent of EU citizens have English as a mother tongue.",0,1
"Traditional studies of evaluation in Systemic Functional Linguistics have presented a wide range of characteristics and resources of implicit and explicit evaluation (henceforth IE and EE). These studies have revealed that IE is tactical and involves complicated expressions but they have not clearly illustrated why speakers/writers choose one linguistic expression of IE instead of another. To address this issue, we carry out a qualitative analysis of IE by establishing an analytical framework comprised of three sub-systems: value, situation and reasoning, based on a reinterpretation of IE in terms of its metafunctions. Within this analytical framework, we generalize a three-dimension space vector model to illustrate the working mechanism behind the choice between various linguistic resources of IE. The model illustrates the collaboration and the complementarity between various constituents in the analytical framework, and what has unfolded in discourse is essentially the result of the vector calculation process.",0,1

"While previous research has shown that language use in the home is an important factor in bilingual language development, little research has focused on how specific language strategies used by parents relate to bilingual children's language exposure and vocabulary development. Yet, for parents, this information has the potential to inform their day-to-day decisions about language use in their home. The present study aims to contribute to this understanding by applying a Bioecological Systems Model to understand how language use within the community and within the family influenced young children’s amount of language exposure and vocabulary abilities. A total of 51 French-English bilingual four-year-old Canadian children participated in the present study. Children’s exposure to each language was measured through parent reports, and their vocabulary was assessed in each language. Differences in community context were not a significant predictor of the amount of exposure or vocabulary abilities. Family language strategies predicted vocabulary scores in English but not French, whereas the amount of exposure predicted vocabulary scores in French but not English. These findings suggest that, in the preschool years, family language use strategies and amount of exposure impact vocabulary development and that their role differs based on context.",0,1
"An unchallenged assumption regarding the linguistic history of the Ch’olan branch of the Mayan language family is that this common language was “split ergative”—demonstrating an ergative/absolutive pattern of pronominal inflection in the completive aspect and a nominative/accusative pattern in the incompletive. Such a hypothesis is untenable in light of the data, which show that the Ch’olti’an branch of Ch’olan did not share in the split ergative innovation. To support this conclusion, the evolutionary history of tense/aspect in each of the modern Ch’olan languages is presented. From a straight ergative ancestral system, a typologically plausible series of changes can account for various systems found in the modern languages. No such account is possible if scholars assume a split ergative system for Common Ch’olan.",0,1

"We examined the effects of order of presentation on the moral judgments of professional philosophers and two comparison groups. All groups showed similar‐sized order effects on their judgments about hypothetical moral scenarios targeting the doctrine of the double effect, the action‐omission distinction, and the principle of moral luck. Philosophers' endorsements of related general moral principles were also substantially influenced by the order in which the hypothetical scenarios had previously been presented. Thus, philosophical expertise does not appear to enhance the stability of moral judgments against this presumably unwanted source of bias, even given familiar types of cases and principles.",0,1
"1.1. Many students of Leonard Blodmfield's Languaget have been inspired, by the extraordinary insight into grammatical phenomena there shown, to attempt descriptive analysis from that basis. Frequently, however, their hopes of success are dulled somewhat by the singular fact that the material proves more elusive in application than it did in appreciation. In an attempt a couple of years ago to use Bloomfield's principles to analyze the complicated syntax of Mixteco, an Indian language of Mexico,' I came to the conclusion that a slightly different statement of the actual procedure of analysis would facilitate syntactic description; this involved a number of criteria which could be applied consecutively in order to arrive at the ranks and labels of construction. It was only recently, however, that I reached a further conclusion: that part of the difficulty of Bloomfield's material for the beginning student was the lack of clarity in his statements of the relationship between taxemes and tagmemes, and the actual operation with these principles. This paper,3 then, has two goals: first to point out this confusion, and second to outline a procedure which a student can apply to the easier stages of syntactic analysis. The illustrative English material, the phonetic transcriptions, and the definitions are deliberately taken from Bloomfield, and constant references are given to his material, to enable the student to correlate this brief study with his more complete descriptive presentation.",0,1

"This paper describes a study conducted in collaboration with a marketing agency and a nonprofit organization (NPO) providing regional sexual health services, which included advice on, and testing for, sexually transmitted infections (STIs). The study investigated the relative effectiveness of different formulations of double entendres on appeal, humor, the likelihood of social media engagement, and intention to seek more information about STIs. Advertisements containing double entendres were significantly more appealing and humorous if: (1) the grammatical formulation did not cue the intended meaning; (2) the double entendre involved a creative metaphorical expression; and (3) the double entendre referred to the middle part of the sexual scenario, referring to action rather than intent or result. Participants’ ratings varied very little according to their age, gender, and education. However, a qualitative investigation of the free-text responses revealed that there was some variation in the types of interpretations that were offered by participants depending on their age, gender, and education. The marketing agency incorporated our findings into their live campaign, which resulted in a notable increase in: (a) website traffic and social media engagement; (b) STI home-testing kits ordered; and (c) STI kits returned for testing, compared with previous campaigns.",0,1
"Reviewed by: Perfect explorations ed. by Artemis Alexiadou, Monika Rathert, and Arnim von Stechow Eugenia Romanova Perfect explorations. Ed. by Artemis Alexiadou, Monika Rathert, and Arnim von Stechow. Berlin: Mouton de Gruyter 2003. Pp. 404. ISBN 3110172291. $117.60 (Hb). Perfect explorations, with its fourteen articles including the introduction, tries to answer complicated questions about the perfect aspect using data from English, Greek, German, Bulgarian, Italian, Arabic, and Russian. The book is written within a uniform semantic and syntactic formalism, introduced in the opening chapter by the editors. Some articles, though, present a pragmatic and historical view on the perfect (Amalia Moser, Ioannis Veloudis). The common formal tools used by the authors from article to article and from language to language form a neat picture throughout the book. Semantically, Hans Reichenbach’s S (speech), R (reference), and E (event) times are applied to the description of both tense and aspect. However, problems accompany this approach; therefore, the writers also appeal to Arthur Prior’s tenses as operators and Barbara Partee’s and Irene Heim’s tenses as variables: (1) ‖PASTi‖g,n = g(i), if g(i) is a time before the time of speech n, undefined otherwise. (2) ‖PRESi‖g,n = g(i), if g(i) is a time identical with n, undefined otherwise. The perfect is subjected to more than one classification: (a) universal, experiential, resultative; and (b) have-perfect, be-perfect. There are further gradations within the latter: have-perfect can be as XN (extended now) or Priorian past; be-perfect can represent target states or resultant states. Syntactically, a common T/A/A architecture is accepted throughout the book, namely: (3) Tense > Perfect > Aspect VP. Thus, the shared terminology of the volume makes it possible for the authors, exploring different languages and presenting seemingly different problems, to isolate recurrent issues in the research into the perfect. The main questions addressed in the book are: (1) Is perfect a tense or an aspect? The answers to this question vary from article to article and from language to language. For Abdelkader Fassi Fehri and Arabic it is some ‘relative’ T or T2. For Amalia Moser and Greek it is also temporal rather than aspectual in character. For other writers there is a complex interplay among viewpoint aspect, Aktionsart, morphological form of the construction, and tense (Fabrizio Arosio, Fassi Fehri, Roumyana Pancheva, and Alla Paslawska and Arnim von Stechow). Different ways of combining all of these factors yield different perfect readings. And this leads to another big issue of the volume: (2) How uniform is the perfect? Being a complex phenomenon, uniting aspectual and temporal properties of the verb and using different morphological tools for its formation, perfect has been subdivided into three to four types: universal (sometimes called XNperfect), experiential, resultative (Pancheva), and recent past (Sabine Iatridou, Elena Anagnosto-poulou, and Roumyana Izvorski). Monika Rathert does not classify the existential perfect into smaller subtypes and discusses the universal/existential dichotomy. (3) What contribution to perfect readings is made by adverbials? Different authors discuss different adverbials [End Page 767] from different points of view. Arosio analyzes Italian per-adverbials and da-adverbials and their combinatory properties with respect to temporal predicates; although both adverbials are durative, the output they produce on combining with the predicates is nonhomogenous and homogenous respectively, which gives the writer a basis for dividing Italian perfect tenses into Perfect I and Perfect II. Fassi Fehri studies the relationships between TA morphology and positional and durational adverbials. Perfect readings depend on the kind of adverbial, as is the case in other languages, for instance, Greek until (Anastasia Giannakidou), English since (Iatridou), German seit (Renate Musan). (4) How is the perfect participle formed and how do we distinguish between stative and eventive perfect participles? Following Angelika Kratzer (‘Building statives’, Berkeley Linguistics Society 26.385–99, 2000), Anagnostopoulou not only subdivides Greek perfect participles into adjectival (stative) or verbal (eventive), she also makes a distinction within adjectival participles (target state and resultant state), depending on the character of different...",0,1
"ABSTRACT Research integrity has been under scrutiny, especially in regard to the legitimacy of academic authorship and co-authorship. We aim to bring a critical perspective to the debate, firstly by presenting how past and recent publications discuss (co-)authorship, and next by developing an appraisal analysis of discourse elements that make types of social sanction regarding the topic available. We conclude by pointing out certain criteria that validate (co-) authorship and kinds of evaluation produced in the reviewed literature. Our results indicate that (co-)authoship credit is affected by power relations and personal interest and that multiauthored publication is gaining significance in collaborative network research environments.",0,1
"Advice, information and safety by means of language: internationally recruited nurses demonstrating their professional Finnish language skills he focus of this paper is on the professional language used by four internationally educated nurses working in Finnish in Finland. The data comes from a tailor-made professional language test module including integrated material-based tasks. The module was designed by the project Health care Finnish: developing and assessing Finnish proficiency among health care professionals (2014−2015) to complement the skill profiles based on the test results of the National Certifi- cates of Language Proficiency (NCLP) intermediate level test. None of the participants had yet reached the level B2 in Finnish, and one of them had reached level B1 in speaking comprehension only. Level B1 (level 3 in NCLP) is currently the level required for authorization in the Finnish health sector for non-EU/EEA health care professionals. However, there are official suggestions that, in the future, the requirements be raised to level B2 (level 4 in NCLP) and also cover EU/EEA educated professionals (Ministry of Education 2014). Assessment of professional language skills has also been suggested, but no decisions have been made on this yet. The aim of the qualitative analysis of the test performance data was to find out how the participants utilize different syntactic, lexical and pragmatic resources to express communicative functions such as giving instructions and documenting information, which are typical for health communication. Also under scrutiny was their ability to shift between professional and colloquial language use.",0,1
"This article explores the connection between expression of valency alternations and the overall morphological typology of a language from a cross-linguistic perspective. On the basis of a typological survey of empirical data in 40 geographically and genealogically diverse languages, it finds two universal tendencies relating to the scale of morphological types from most to least bound: fusional – agglutinative – isolating. First, the compatibility of morphological techniques used to express valency alternations does not extend further left than the overall morphological typology of the language. Second, it may extend further right, with extensive attestation of this possibility. The morphological expression of valency alternations is thus constrained by the overall morphology of the language, but tends to be pushed further towards the right.",0,1
"Literature on early language acquisition has observed that age of onset of acquisition (AoA) is relevant for certain grammatical phenomena. Simultaneous bilinguals receive regular and extensive exposure to two languages from birth (Müller, 2009), whereas sequential child learners get in extensive contact to LB once the LA has developed to a certain degree (Meisel, J. M. [2013]. Sensitive phases in successive language acquisition: The Critical Period Hypothesis revisited. In C. Boeckx & K. Grohmann (Eds.), Handbook of biolinguistics (pp. 69–85). Cambridge University Press). Exposure to LB can take place early in childhood (eL2 learners, age 3;0) or starting with elementary school (cL2 learners, age 6;0). In this study, 34 participants were recruited from different Catalan-speaking regions and displayed different AoA-profiles (12 simultaneous, 13 eL2 and 9 cL2 learners) and different degrees of language dominance (17 balanced, 10 Spanish and 7 Catalan dominant). We conducted a Preference Task to examine Catalan copula selection in locative contexts with (non-)eventive subjects, since it may pattern differently in Catalan/Spanish: Both languages select ésser/ser for eventive subjects, non-eventive subjects take estar in Spanish but show variation in Catalan. Our study examines whether the factors AoA, language dominance or the speaker’s linguistic variety determine copula selection. In a nutshell, all speakers preferred ésser with eventive subjects. For non-eventive subjects, the results show that language dominance and speaker’s linguistic variety predict copula preference.",0,1
"The translation of French modified proper names (Npr) into Swedish gives rise to cultural problems, in view of the fact that Swedes are not always familiar with the original referents of the Npr. Linguistic problems do also arise due to the difficulty in Swedish to create new interpretations of the Npr by adding a determiner in front of it. The article system is not so highly developped in Swedish as in French, the partitive article du, de la, de l&#8217;, and the indefinite plural article des lacking in Swedish. On the other hand, Swedish noun morphology is extremely complex: the definite article is agglutinated (-n, -en, -t, -et) and since there are seven declinations, plural endings show great variation (-ar, -or, -er, -r, -n, &#216;, -s). The addition of one of these audible endings to the Npr comes in striking contrast with the fundamentally indeclinable form of the Npr. So even if most of the French types of modified Npr can be found also in Swedish, treated in the Grammar of the Swedish Academy as Npr converted into common nouns, their translation may be problematic due to differences in the morphological systems.On the basis of examples from texts mainly by Balzac and Proust, the translation into Swedish of French modified metaphoric and metonymic Npr is examined. As regards the metaphoric Npr, most of Newmark&#8217;s (1982) strategies for the translation of metaphors are applied, and that of explicitating the relation of similarity is most often used. The translation of metonymic Npr, which designate either (a part of) an artist&#8217;s or writer&#8217;s works or a person&#8217;s typical behaviour, usually needs an indication of what sort of referent is intended. In both cases, the Npr is &#8220;demodified&#8221; in the Swedish translation and appears in its prototypical use, as a rigid designator of its original referent.",0,1
"Von Kindern mit Spezifischer Spracherwerbsstörung (SSES) wird häufig berichtet, dass sie umfangreiche Schwierigkeiten im Sprachverstehen sowie in der Ausdifferenzierung des Lexikons haben (vgl. Bishop 1979; Leonard 1998; McGregor et al. 2002). Diese Schwierigkeiten kommen besonders dann zum Tragen, wenn sie Informationen in einen Kontext einbetten müssen, um beispielsweise implizite Bedeutungen zu erschließen (vgl. Norbury and Bishop 2002) oder um ambige (mehrdeutige) sowie semantisch differenzierte bzw. anspruchsvolle Äußerungen aufzulösen (vgl. Norbury 2004). Die vorliegende Untersuchung knüpft an eine Arbeit zum Erwerb des semantisch- lexikalischen Systems an (vgl. Wahn 2013) und geht der Frage nach, welche Bedeutung mehrdeutigen Wörtern im Zweitspracherwerb sowie der Strukturierung des Lexikons zukommt. Zur Klärung dieser Frage wurde eine Population von zweisprachigen Kindern (N = 19) im Alter von 7;0 bis 10;11 Jahren unter Berücksichtigung der Sprachgenese (sprachunauffällig vs. sprachauffällig / SSES) mit Hilfe eines Arbeitsinstrumentes untersucht (vgl. Wahn 2013). Der t-Test für abhängige Stichproben zeigt, dass sich zweisprachige sprachunauffällige 7–10-Jährige von zweisprachigen sprachauffälligen 7–10-Jährigen hinsichtlich der Fähigkeit zur Nutzung von Kontextinformation und hinsichtlich der Antonymie als wichtiges Organisationsprinzip des Lexikons unterscheiden. Darüber hinaus erbrachten multifaktorielle Varianzanalysen eine signifikante Hauptwirkung für die Sprachgenese bei der Überprüfung des Kontextwissens durch Polyseme, für Antonyme (gegensätzliche sprachliche Ausdrücke) sowie eine signifikante Wechselwirkung für die Sprachgenese und den Spracherwerbstyp hinsichtlich der Fähigkeit zu assoziieren in der Gesamtstichprobe (vgl. Wahn 2013).

"While agreeing with Smith that the lexical categories cannot be defined pragmatically, I disagree with his implication that Baker 2003 is a pragmatic theory. Rather, I attempt to clarify my view that the definitional differences between nouns, verbs, and adjectives are primarily syntactic in nature. These syntactic differences stand in a natural correspondence to the pragmatic differences discussed in the literature in many cases, but when syntax and pragmatics go separate ways, category distinctions clearly follow the syntax. Given this, it stands to reason that the accuracy of the definitions can only be assessed if the syntactic structure of relevant examples has been accurately determined. I discuss a few suggestive examples of how this might be done in some “contentious” cases.",0,1

"Edward Stankiewicz In Memoriam Robert Greenberg Professor Edward Stankiewicz (1920–2013) was the B. E. Bensinger Professor of Slavic Languages and Literatures at Yale University from 1971 until he retired in 1991. Thereafter, he remained an active scholar as Professor Emeritus for nearly twenty years. His continued active pursuit of scholarship reflected his unparalleled dedication to the field. Edward passed away on January 31, 2013, and as Harvey Goldblatt noted in his message to the Yale community, that day we lost one of the world’s leading Slavists. Indeed, I can think of few others who were so passionate about Slavic linguistics; he was fluent in many languages, including at least six Slavic languages, and was keenly interested in the diachronic and synchronic state of all Slavic languages and dialects. Born in Warsaw on November 17, 1920, Edward was also a talented artist and poet, who on occasion would entertain guests by playing his mandolin and singing his favorite songs in Yiddish. A Holocaust survivor, Edward immigrated to the United States after being liberated from the Buchenwald concentration camp at the end of World War II. He frequently spoke of his time in transit through Italy, where he developed a love of the Italian language and culture. A student of Roman Jakobson, Edward received his PhD from Harvard in 1954, and taught at Indiana University and the University of Chicago before joining Yale. Edward Stankiewicz inspired a generation of Slavists. While perhaps best known for his work on Slavic accentology and morphophonemics, he also published on the phonology and morphology of all the Slavic languages, wrote about the theories of language and the history of linguistics, studied the history of the Slavic literary languages, and thoroughly immersed himself in Slavic dialectology. My fellow graduate students and I recall his frequent lectures on the prosodic features of Common Slavic, one of Edward’s favorite topics. Edward would declare that only through an understanding of pitch, quantity, and stress in Common Slavic is it possible to predict the corresponding forms in Slovene, Serbo-Croatian, Czech, Polish, or Russian. Long vowels and stress patterns would cause those of us attending his class [End Page 3] a great deal of trepidation, as Edward would frequently call on us to come to the blackboard to write a morphophonemic transcription of a Russian verb form, or to offer examples of how the Common Slavic acute became shortened in West South Slavic. Those sessions at the blackboard could be occasionally traumatic, but that method prevented us from forgetting Slavic accentology well after we left our graduate programs. Oddly, years later I could hear myself in class using Edward’s examples for my own students. Edward embraced structuralism as his theoretical muse, and his first major published works were structural analyses of Russian dialects, followed by his 1968 monograph, Declension and Gradation of Russian Substantives (The Hague: Mouton). Edward took a keen interest in the South Slavic languages. He travelled to Yugoslavia for research and study trips, where he not only collected extensive dialectological materials, but also became a fluent speaker of Slovene and Serbo-Croatian, and established friendships with Pavle Ivić and Blaže Koneski, among others. Edward’s extensive works on Slavic morphophonemics and accentology were published or republished in his two volumes of collected essays, Studies in Slavic Morphophonemics and Accentology (Ann Arbor: Michigan Slavic Studies, 1979), and The Slavic Languages: Unity in Diversity (The Hague: Mouton, 1986). These works included many of the central arguments that were further developed in The Accentual Patterns of the Slavic Languages (Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 1993). In this work, Edward provided a systematic and comprehensive analysis of the Slavic accentual patterns, which is arguably one of the most complex areas within Slavic phonology.

"We examined whether and how conversational roles shape the extent to which details and recollections surrounding World War II (WWII) emerge in family conversations. Each family was tasked with collaboratively discussing four topics surrounding WWII specific to Belgium. We then conducted both quantitative and qualitative analyses. The former compared the collaborative recall with each family member’s individual recall; the latter focused on the conversational roles and dynamics within each family. While the results suggest that familial discussions lead to more “old” (from the individual recollection) recollections than “new” recollections, about 40% new recollections did emerge; however, with fewer personal details surrounding the discussed recollections. Although, the extent to which more details and new recollections emerged during the conversations across families depended on the conversational roles adopted by each discussant. Our results are discussed in terms of the importance of conversational roles in understanding when and how memories may emerge within a conversation and, in turn, transmit across generations.",0,1

"Abstract Paul Pietroski develops an iconoclastic account of linguistic meaning. Here, I invite him to say more about what it implies about the relations between language, truth, and conceptual content. Readers concerned with securing the objectivity of conceptual thought may be worried about his claims that typical concepts “have no extensions” and that they “fit one another better than they fit the world.” Others might applaud his anti‐extensionalism in natural‐language semantics but fear that his account re‐raises familiar problems about extensions at the level of psychology.",0,1
"In this paper I discuss two problems which recently also have been analysed by Holger Steen Sørensen, namely: what is the subject of a sentence when the subject (or part of it) is a hypostasis expression? And to what word-class do hypostasis words belong? I arrive at other solutions than Sørensen and maintain that the hypostasis marks and that which is marked are identical with the subject. Further, hypostasis words are classified as nouns.",0,1
"Welsh has a long bardic tradition, and glossaries of archaic vocabulary were first compiled for the training of poets. The first printed dictionary appeared relatively early in 1547 and was followed by much lexicographical activity over the following centuries. By the nineteenth century, there was a glut of bilingual dictionaries, but no dictionaries were available specifically for children until 1968. The majority of children's dictionaries up to the 1990s were either monolingual or bilingual picture dictionaries based on English publications lacking important Welsh words with no English equivalent and little or no grammatical information. Since that time there have been considerable developments: original dictionaries have been produced for different age groups, with due attention given to the grammatical information supplied and better use made of illustrations. An online Welsh dictionary demonstrates what could be achieved for children, given sufficient resources.",0,1

"Many applications use sequences of n consecutive symbols (n-grams). Hashing these n-grams can be a performance bottleneck. For more speed, recursive hash families compute hash values by updating previous values. We prove that recursive hash families cannot be more than pairwise independent. While hashing by irreducible polynomials is pairwise independent, our implementations either run in time O(n) or use an exponential amount of memory. As a more scalable alternative, we make hashing by cyclic polynomials pairwise independent by ignoring n-1 bits. Experimentally, we show that hashing by cyclic polynomials is is twice as fast as hashing by irreducible polynomials. We also show that randomized Karp-Rabin hash families are not pairwise independent.",0,1
"espanolEste articulo presenta un analisis de la interaccion discursiva: maestro-texto escolaralumno en el desarrollo de los temas ‘El agua’ y ‘El aire’ en un curso de octavo grado. El objetivo es analizar en que medida las caracteristicas discursivas de un texto escolar de Ciencias Naturales, mediadas por el discurso del docente, facilitan la comprension de los conceptos y contribuyen a la formacion ciudadana. La metodologia combina la etnografia y el analisis del discurso. El lenguaje del texto escolar se analiza desde categorias de la metafuncion experiencial de la Linguistica Sistemico Funcional: metafora gramatical, transitividad y ergatividad. En el analisis del discurso en el aula, se tuvieron en cuenta, a nivel de clausula, las funciones del habla construidas en la metafuncion interpersonal, y a nivel de segmentos discursivos, los patrones de interaccion incluyendo la secuencia: Interrogacion, Respuesta y Evaluacion (IRE). Los resultados indican que el lenguaje del texto escolar se caracteriza por la presencia de procesos materiales no ergativos y el empleo frecuente de nominalizaciones. La maestra utiliza reiteradamente la secuencia IRE, caracterizada por preguntas por dato y ordenes. El lenguaje de los alumnos imita las vaguedades del discurso de la maestra y el texto, sin asomo de elaboracion y criticidad. Estos hallazgos permiten concluir que algunos rasgos discursivos del texto y el lenguaje empleado por la maestra, dificultan la comprension de los conceptos estudiados y no fomentan en los estudiantes competencias que les posibiliten una participacion ciudadana informada y consciente de su rol en la sociedad EnglishThis paper presents an analysis of the teacher-textbook- student interaction that takes place during the development of the topics ‘Water’ and ‘Air’ in eighth grade. The purpose is to analyze to what extent the discourse features of a Natural Science school textbook, mediated by the teacher´s discourse, facilitate the students´ understanding of natural events and contribute to the development of citizenship competences. The methodology of the study combined classroom ethnography and discourse analysis. The language of the textbook is analyzed from the perspective of the experiential metafunction within Functional Systemic Linguistics; namely, grammatical metaphor, transitivity and ergativity. At the clause level, classroom discourse was analyzed in terms of the speech functions that realize the interpersonal metafunction. At the level of discourse segments, patterns of interaction including Interrogation-ResponseFeedback (IRF) sequences were examined. Results suggest that the language of the textbook contains a large number of non-ergative material processes and a large number of nominalizations. The teacher repeatedly resorts to IRF sequences, in which she gives orders and asks for specific information. The language of the students tends to imitate many of the features of the language of the text and of the teacher, without evidence of elaboration and criticism. These findings suggest that some linguistic features of the text, as well as the language used by the teacher, do not (neither) facilitate the understanding of the concepts under study, nor do they (nor) foster competences among students that would enable them to exercise informed and conscious citizenship",0,1

"Metaphors are central in communication and sense-making processes in health-related contexts. Yet how the metaphors used by health-care-professionals to make sense of their patients and their relations to them are associated to the perceived valence of their clinical encounters is underexplored. Drawing-upon the ABC Model of Dehumanization, this study investigated how the humanizing or dehumanizing metaphors nurses’ use for making sense of their pain patients are associated with how they perceived their relationships with them. Fifty female nurses undertook individual narrative-episodic interviews about easy/difficult cases in pain care. A content analysis classified the metaphors, identifying eight classes reflecting different types of patients (de)humanization. A multiple correspondence analysis extracted patterns of metaphors and their association with the perceived characteristics of the patient-nurse relationship. It showed how these patterns were not associated with patient sex or socioeconomic status (SES) but were related to the perceived valence of the clinical relationship. By uncovering how patient metaphors guide nurses’ sense-making and potentially modulate interactions in clinical encounters, these findings may contribute to improve quality of pain care.",0,1
"The current study investigated how a contextual list signal influences comprehenders’ inference generation of upcoming discourse relations and whether individual differences in working memory capacity and linguistic experience influence the generation of these inferences. Participants were asked to complete two-sentence stories, the first sentence of which contained an expression of quantity (a few, multiple). Several individual-difference measures were calculated to explore whether individual characteristics can explain the sensitivity to the contextual list signal. The results revealed that participants were sensitive to a contextual list signal (i.e., they provided list continuations), and this sensitivity was modulated by the participants’ linguistic experience, as measured by an author recognition test. The results showed no evidence that working memory affected participants’ responses. These results extend prior research by showing that contextual signals influence participants’ coherence-relation-inference generation. Further, the results of the current study emphasize the importance of individual reader characteristics when it comes to coherence-relation inferences.",0,1
"This article elucidates the distinction between type and token interdiscursivity (Silverstein 2005) through an analysis of Japanese wedding speeches. Type interdiscursivity is genre defining, involving the use of speech formulae to frame the performance as an instance of the wedding speech genre. By contrast, token interdiscursivity in these speeches involves the artful insertion of quoted texts that are reinterpreted in the wedding speech context. Through a process of citation, quotation, and exegesis, speakers construct the replicated text as authoritative and borrow the authority of prior speakers for their own rhetorical purposes. Both forms of interdiscursivity allow speakers to use existing cultural resources to create new texts that are simultaneously appropriate, authoritative, and creative.",0,1
"Traditionally, transfer is described as interference and consequently as an unintentional mechanism. More recently, however, the perception of control in transfer has changed and it is now commonly accepted that transfer can occur both automatically and strategically. Studies have previously employed think-aloud protocols during writing tasks to establish the degree of intentionality in transfer. However, this method does not let us distinguish between instances of transfer that are truly unintentional and instances that were simply not commented on due to the constraints imposed by the think-aloud protocol. The present study, therefore, conducted a stimulated recall interview in direct succession of the think-aloud protocol in order to categorise also those instances of transfer that were not commented on initially. With data from highly multilingual adult learners of Catalan, the study examines the proportion of unintentional and intentional transfer in relation to (1) different types of transfer, (2) different source languages of transfer and (3) different word classes in transfer. The data indicates that some of these aspects of transfer tend to occur unintentionally, whereas others are more prone to be used intentionally. The theoretical implications of the results, as well as their limitations, are discussed.",0,1
"Discourse and communication approaches to culture have traditionally been concerned with the role of language in (mis)representing cultures. But how text and talk reproduce and transform cultures is just beginning to be understood. Proceeding from the view that cultural creation, development and transformation are constituted in and through situated discursive practice, this study explores the interconnections between argumentative discourse and cultural reproduction. The research is based on multinational and multilingual data of journalistic communication on Hong Kong’s historic transition. It is shown that the causes of Hong Kong’s economic success, as an important cultural feature, are used as arguments to undermine contrary claims. It is also revealed that the future development of Hong Kong is being constrained by the argument ad baculum. In addition, it is observed that Hong Kong’s identities are used as bases for prescribing desired course of action. Finally, these argumentative strategies are re-examined in their broader historical and cultural context in order to show how Hong Kong’s past, present and future are cultural realities bound up with Western desire and power.",0,1

"This paper explores the feasibility of modelling concept concreteness perceived by humans and representing it in computational semantic lexicons, addressing an issue at the crossroads of computational linguistics, lexicography, and psycholinguistics. The inherent distinction between concrete words and abstract words in psychology has relied mostly on subjective human ratings. This practice is hardly scalable and does not consider the effect of polysemy. In view of this, we attempt to obtain a measure of concreteness from dictionary definitions comparable to human judgement, capitalising on conventional lexicographic assumptions and the regularities exhibited in the surface structures of sense definitions. The structural pattern of a definition is analysed and scored on a 7-point scale of concreteness ratings. The definition scores turned out to be quite effective for a dichotomous distinction between concrete and abstract concepts and more consistent with human ratings for the former. Beyond the two-way distinction, however, the results were more variable. The study has thus revealed the potentials and limitations of our approach, suggesting that different defining styles probably reflect the describability of concepts, and describability alone may not be sufficient for differentiating the degree of concreteness. The range of definition patterns has to be reconsidered, in combination with other inseparable factors constituting our perception of concreteness, for better modelling on a finer scale of concreteness distinction to enrich semantic lexicons for natural language processing.",0,1

"Reviewed by: Writing Better English Li-Shih Huang Seick, Ed . (2004). Writing Better English. New York: McGraw-Hill. Pp. 200, $14.95 US (paper). Writing Better English is a user-friendly workbook on basic grammar and writing for second language learners of English. This workbook takes a building-block approach to improving ESL (English as a second language) learners' writing skills by guiding them as they progress from understanding the parts of speech to writing short sentences and then to completing stories. The workbook is organized into six brief, easy-to-follow sections, each building on the previous ones. Setting the foundation for the rest of the workbook, the first section opens with a review of grammar basics that covers, for example, verb tenses, auxiliaries, conjunctions, pronouns, possessives, plurals, and also comparative and superlative word forms. This coverage also provides a base from which learners can self-assess their familiarity with basic grammatical elements and structures, [End Page 594] as well as their readiness to write. The review then leads to a brief section on completing sentences, which prompts ESL writers to determine elements that are missing and the appropriate words to use. Following the sentence completion exercises, learners proceed to writing short sentences. The workbook then moves beyond sentence-level writing to story completion exercises. Before the final section on composing stories, with such suggested topics as 'The Most Unforgettable Day,' 'Peace or War,' and 'Your Autobiography,' the workbook includes a practical section on writing personal and business letters. This section includes sample letters and provides ESL writers with a simple way to approach letter writing by considering appropriate formats, structures, and components. In each section, the author provides non-technical explanations, examples, and plenty of guided application exercises, thus progressively promoting learner creativity in the writing tasks. While this workbook is easy to understand and includes information that would be useful to ESL learners, several aspects of its presentation raise questions about its value. First, the proficiency level of the learners this workbook is designed to help has not been clarified. Since the workbook is intended for self-studying and supplementary learning, indicating the intended readership's proficiency level would be helpful. Second, the author claims that ESL writers can use the workbook to 'learn essential vocabulary and grammar' (front cover). It is not clear that the vocabulary development approach was used to 'increase [ESL writers'] proficiency in vocabulary usage' (back cover). Each of the 11 topics suggested for writing stories is followed by instructions about which specific grammatical structures to use. Then there are four to five questions intended to help the writers generate ideas, and five or six 'helpful vocabulary words' (pp. 143–147). I do not think that simply providing a list of five to six words for each composition topic is the best way to develop ESL writers' 'proficiency in vocabulary usage,' since research has shown that vocabulary can best be learned through reading 'authentic' texts (see Wallace, 1992) and seeing words used in a variety of contexts (rather than the constructed and artificial examples commonly found in textbooks) (see, e.g., Coady & Huckin, 1997). With regard to grammar, I also wonder whether prescribing the tenses and grammatical structures to use is a helpful way to approach writing stories. In addition, there is no discussion of critical grammatical items that are particularly challenging or troublesome to ESL writers; that is, beginners and advanced learners alike. Such a discussion might include, for example, the use of singulars and plurals, articles, prepositions, modal auxiliary verbs, gerunds and infinitives, relative pronouns, [End Page 595] and ambiguous pronouns. These tricky elements are present in the written texts produced by ESL writers at all levels and deserve consideration for integration into the workbook. Third, I question the provision of rules, drill-like grammar exercises that involve the manipulation of form (e.g., changing 'Her brother is very rich' to the past, past perfect, and future tenses or filling in the blank with the correct verb form), and isolated sentences and artificial examples that are devoid of context and situations of communication. This approach seems to move the teaching of writing back to the practice of prescriptive grammar, which emphasizes...",0,1
"Abstract This paper presents the analysis of the Hungarian nuclear expansion controversy using a conceptual framework that links strategic maneuvering with an extended polylogical controversy and evaluates the strategic maneuvering of political, environmentalist and expert actors. The paper aims to show that the three aspects of strategic maneuvering (audience demand, topical potential, presentational devices) are flexible enough that they can be analyzed when the object of study is not a spatially and temporally localized argumentative situation, but a decade-long debate with multiple actors. In 2014, Hungary signed a deal with Russia to finance 80% of the investment costs and supply two new reactors to maintain the 40–50% of nuclear energy in the national energy production.",0,1
"This study explored effects of Spanish oral language skills (vocabulary and syntax) on the development of English oral language skills (vocabulary, morphology, semantics, syntax) and reading comprehension among 156 bilingual Latino children in second through fifth grade whose first language was Spanish and whose second language was English. Using a cohort-sequential design (Cohort 1: second–third grade; Cohort 2: third–fourth grade; Cohort 3: fourth–fifth grade), we estimated Grade 2–5 trajectories of English oral language skills and reading comprehension. We assessed whether early levels of Spanish vocabulary and syntax predicted: (a) students’ fifth-grade English oral language skills and reading comprehension; and (b) students’ Grade 2–5 growth in these skills. Results showed that Spanish syntax predicted all Grade 5 English oral language skills and reading comprehension. Spanish syntax was also positively related to growth in English semantic knowledge. Spanish vocabulary was not associated with any English oral language skills or reading outcomes. Theoretically, results suggest that explorations of “transfer” from Spanish to English are likely moderated by the constructs under study and the means by which they are operationalized. Instructionally, working with bilingual learners around issues related to Spanish and English syntax has implications for bilingually and metalinguistically oriented teaching approaches that may build linguistic knowledge and promote reading comprehension.",0,1

"In this article, a number of broad questions related to the acquisition of consonant clusters in a second language are investigated. Drawing on the structural relations and phonological principles of Government Phonology, it is argued that the behaviour of second language learners can be accounted for by a top-down, left-to-right phonological parser. Appealing to a model of cognitive architecture, it is demonstrated that one can account for the different behaviours of speakers of languages that share the trait of lacking tautosyllabic clusters (Korean and Finnish) when learning a language which allows such clusters (English). Properties of the L1 segmental inventory and a licensing strength scale are proposed to explain why Finnish learners have less trouble than Korean learners when acquiring English clusters.",0,1
"The regularity of sound change as set out by the scholars of the late nineteenth century is a fundamental principle of historical linguistics. The principle as recognized by the Neogrammarian linguists states that once a sound change has begun, it affects every word in the vocabulary that contains the sound in question. The principle has been disputed by many linguists and especially dialectologists, who argue that 'every word has its own history'. This article demonstrates how the Neogrammarian principle operates in one prototypical change in progress, the raising of the mid front long vowel /ey/ before a consonant in Philadelphia English. Mixed-level regression analysis shows consistent phonetic constraints across the nineteenth century, with no effect of word frequency. The regularity of sound change is reflected in the common pattern of behavior of the most frequent words, those of moderate frequency, and words that occur only once in the corpus.",0,1
"Despite the long tradition of using the scientific method to study language, there is a widespread, if largely anecdotally based, feeling among language scientists that the general public does not perceive language to be a classic object of scientific study. The goal of the current study was to investigate this notion. We report the results of three experiments conducted in informal science learning environments that: (i) confirm the public thinks of science and language as fundamentally different objects, and (ii) show there are some areas of language science that are more readily accepted as science than others. Our results also suggest that high-impact demonstrations of core linguistic phenomena may be used to encourage people to recognize that language can be, and often is, an object of scientific study. Although the public has an incomplete understanding of the study of language, we argue that the strong humanistic approach with which the public associates the study of language can be seen as an opportunity to broaden participation in science.",0,1

"Abako (Alliance des Bakongo), one of the main political parties rallying for Congolese independence in the late 1950s, started off as a linguistic-cultural movement to promote the use of the Kikongo language and Kongo identity in Leopoldville against a dominance of the Lingala language and “Bangala.” In reaction to this, members of the “Bangala” elite also organised themselves, after which a series of ideological confrontations between “Bakongo” and “Bangala” intellectuals ensued. Tracing back Abako's transformation from cultural movement to political party, we describe how, in pre-independence Kinshasa, politics was ethnicised and ethnicity was politicised along this Bakongo–Bangala and Kikongo–Lingala divide. We analyse how the initial entente between Abako elites and colonial missionaries in favour of Kikongo morphed into a hostile, anti-colonial discourse as the struggle for independence reached its height. This Congolese case shows how, as the decades of colonial decay progressed, the nexus between ethnolanguage and colonisation inevitably also became one between ethnolanguage and anti-colonisation.",0,1
"Bilinguals recognize words with shared morphology and phonology cross-linguistically (i.e., cognates) faster than words that do not have these characteristics. Moreover, higher phonological overlap in cognates enhances the effects, which suggests that phonology eases word recognition. However, it is currently unclear whether words compete purely morphologically before spoken word recognition within language and whether proficiency in the L2 modulates the degree of morphological competition. Spanish monolinguals and English L2 learners of Spanish with varying L2 proficiency completed an auditory lexical decision task in Spanish. Stimuli were phonological sequences of Spanish words prior to a recognition point (e.g., /mark/ in /marko/) whose activated cohorts were minimal pairs. Some pairs were morphologically related (e.g., huerto ‘vegetable patch’ versus huerta ‘vegetable garden’), whereas some others had no morphological relationship (e.g., marco ‘frame’ versus marca ‘brand’). Results showed that both groups processed solely phonological competitors in a similar way as they did with morphological competitors. Taken together, these findings suggest that morphological relatedness does not modulate either L1 or L2 spoken word recognition prior to a recognition point when speakers listen to words in absence of context. In addition, the findings suggest that the L2 recognition architecture is qualitatively similar to that of native speakers.",0,1
"Abstract: This study explores adolescents’ accounts of self-harm with a view to elucidate the implications for health care practitioners seeking to administer care to teenagers in English. Drawing on a corpus of 1.6 million words from messages posted on a UK-hosted adolescent health Web site, analysis began by identifying a range of keywords relating to self-harm. The subsequent contextual examination of these keywords afforded a close description of the contributors’ experiences of self-harm and the factors that resulted in their self-injurious behaviours. A recurring theme was that of the habitual nature of self-harm, with the act being represented as a form of addiction over which they had little control. Self-harmers construct the phenomenon as particularly powerful, and the act is formulated as the only effective means of relief from emotional turmoil. If we are to increase parents and health professionals’ ability to respond to self-injury in the medium of English, close linguistic attention to individuals’ accounts of self-harm is valuable. Online health resources are also valuable means of eliciting concerns from distressed adolescents who are often reluctant to seek support from professionals face-to-face.",0,1
The subject of the present article is the application of the ARIMA method of time-series analysis and of conventional statistical tests to the study of rhythm in text. The results obtained on the same set of samples with both investigative approaches are then compared. Sequential modelling by means of the ARIMA method turns out to be much more efficient than “mass” statistics.,0,1
"Cet article vise à décrire les propriétés grammaticales de couplages de constructions verbales asyndétiques ( i.e. non liées par un morphème segmental subordonnant ou coordonnant) exprimant une valeur temporelle.

"The television show, ‘Who Wants to be a Millionaire?’ (WWTBM) was created in the UK by the independent production company Celador in 1998. It is a general knowledge quiz show in which contestants have the chance to win a top prize of one million pounds. The programme has reached its fifteenth series in the UK and it runs several nights a week on the independent television network. It has been exported to over 100 countries worldwide. In March and April of 2003 two contestants and an accomplice were tried and convicted of attempting to defraud the programme of the million pound prize. Their strategy involved the contestant, after having been asked the questions, ‘thinking aloud’ about possible answers whilst an accomplice in the studio guided him towards the correct one by a system of coughing. This report describes the methods used by the authors to determine from the recordings of the programme where in the studio the coughing was coming from.",0,1
"Summary All in all it will be seen that photo‐palatography (PP), defined as painting the subject's tongue plus photographing the mirror image of the subject's palate after pronouncing, is superior to the artificial palate method (APM), whether the contact surface is drawn or photographed, namely in one very important respect: — In PP the subject articulates more freely than in the APM; hence the contact surface is usually more accurate in the first case — a fact of highest interest to phoneticians. In addition to that, the preparatory stages of the APM, i. e. the production of negative and positive palate casts, can be dispensed with in PP, which means an appreciable reduction of the time needed for the subject to be at the operator's disposal. Yet the photo‐palatogram is sometimes hard to interpret on account of photographic errors; on such occasions a positive palate cast will serve perfectly well as a corrective, but it is by no means necessary to take the negative cast before the actual experiment. The painting is annoying to the subject if repeated; intensive studies of single individuals are, therefore, more suitable performed with the APM or a mixed PP‐APM. Any palatogram with the inner contour of the teeth still traceable can henceforth be expressed numerically, either according to the dentril code method or to the contcict index method.",0,1

"Reviewed by: Phonological acquisition: Child language and constraint-based grammar by Anne-Michelle Tessier John Archibald Phonological acquisition: Child language and constraint-based grammar. By Anne-Michelle Tessier. Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2016. Pp. 414. ISBN 9780230293779. $55. Introduction This book has clearly been written by someone who researches, teaches, and loves phonological acquisition. There are many audiences who are interested in child speech: linguists, clinicians, teachers, psychologists, and so forth. Each audience presents its own challenges, of course. Tessier has succeeded in producing a book that will fit into the undergraduate linguistics curriculum because it seeks to both describe and explain (in the Chomskyan sense) the developmental paths and patterns of child phonological acquisition. T also ensures that the book is well grounded in phonological theory, which is important for two reasons. One is that any account of language acquisition depends on the model of what is being acquired (and that is what phonological theory provides). Second, any discussion of child phonology needs to tackle the question of whether child grammars are consistent with the principles and properties of the grammars of primary languages (say adult French, or Norwegian). It would certainly work in a course dedicated to child phonology, but I can also see it working as one of the texts for a course on phonological theory. Brief summary At first blush, many researchers and students alike might be forgiven for thinking that phonological acquisition is a specialized niche in the linguistic academy. However, as the book ably demonstrates, in order to be able to deeply probe the intricacies of the field, the researcher needs to be conversant in: child development, auditory perception, articulatory phonetics, phonological theory, and psycholinguistic methodology. It is, hence, a field that brings together many different perspectives in order to be able to understand the phenomena in question. The structure of the book reflects this broad perspective. Ch. 1 (‘A phonological refresher’) introduces such things as the International Phonetic Alphabet, spectrograms, syllabic structure, sonority, and stress (and metrical feet), as well as concepts such as competence/performance and production/perception that are important when it comes to understanding what children know and can do. Ch. 2 (‘Infant speech acquisition’) outlines the research paradigm, which has demonstrated that a lot is going on in that first year of life. Children can perceive, discriminate, and anticipate many phonological elements long before they are producing them. As T notes, in her engaging style, ‘after reading Chapter 2, you will never look at drooling babies the same way again’. She explores high-amplitude sucking and head-turn preference methodologies to gain insight into the perceptual world of infants, and examines the early production stages of babbling (canonical and variegated). All of this sets the stage for Ch. 3 (‘Early phonology: The shapes of syllables’), which introduces some of the basic machinery of optimality theory (OT), focusing on syllabic constraints (such as NoCoda and NoComplexOnset) as well as issues of the nature of the input forms. Thus, tableaux and the notion of optimizing syllabic shapes in output are presented to the students. This is done in a way that interleaves the discussion of child outputs with the constraint-based phonologies of language such as Samoan, Yakuts, and Portuguese. T provides useful signposts for students who want to know more about the representations (are stress or syllables included?) or constraints (functional grounding). In this way, a phonological acquisition course would blend well with an advanced course on phonological theory. I have often found it to be the case that there is a sizable group of students who come to appreciate the theory if it is grounded in acquisition data. Speaking personally, much of what I know of syntactic theory came from reading work on L2 syntax. It works for phonology too. [End Page e375] Ch. 4 (‘Early phonology: Word sizes and shapes’) looks at larger prosodic units such as metrical feet (iambs and trochees) and constructs such as the minimal word, which influence the phonological outputs of children. These data allow for an exploration of markedness and faithfulness constraints in order to explain developmental paths. Ch. 5 (‘Early phonology: Consonants’) outlines OT accounts of child consonantal...",0,1
"Previous research on speech in Vermont has revealed evidence of dialect leveling but with much individual variation. the purpose of the current study of the raising and fronting of /aʊ/ in Vermont is to explore this residual variation with an eye toward offering interpretations based upon group and personal identity and affiliation. broad demographically based analyses as well as the examination of interview content and individual vowel data provide insight into the process of dialect leveling in Vermont. Specifically, in addition to such demographic factors as age and gender, overall life affiliation differences and individual life choices gleaned from interview material are helpful in disambiguating what would otherwise seem to be anomalous variable features. this combination of methods may be particularly useful in situations of economic and cultural change.",0,1

"Las diversas caracterizaciones que del proceso de adquisicion de la lengua materna se han venido haciendo hasta la fecha pueden situarse, en lineas generales, dentro de dos marcos teoricos fundamentales: el innatista y el empirista. En la actualidad resulta posible llevar a cabo una critica mas fundada de este ultimo (que parece corroborar su incapacidad para explicar adecuadamente las condiciones en las que se produce la ontogenia linguistica), asi como una validacion mas precisa del primero (que parece, asimismo, confirmar la hipotesis de que nacemos dotados de una capacidad innata para adquirir el lenguaje), merced a la consideracion de las evidencias empiricas y las propuestas teoricas surgidas en los ultimos anos acerca de este proceso.

"In this paper, I first look at how the notions of “politeness” and “impoliteness” have been discussed in the literature including my own ideas of relating universal levels of impoliteness to culture and language-specific levels. Given this framework and my earlier postulation of a set of dimensions along which German speakers were found to prefer expressions that are more direct than indirect, more explicit than implicit, and generally more content-oriented than addressee-oriented, I provide several examples of German speakers interacting with members of other cultures in everyday talk and academic advising sessions. In interpreting the results of the analyses of these interactions, I attempt to relate them to the concept of impoliteness, to German speakers' communicative preferences and to the distinction between an emic and an etic perspective.",0,1
"Speech-language pathologists (SLPs), and really their patients, are often faced with challenging clinical decisions to be made. Patients may decline interventions recommended by the SLP and are often inappropriately labeled ""noncompliant."" The inappropriateness of this label extends beyond the negative charge; the patient's right to refuse is, in fact, protected by law. Anecdotal exchanges, social media platforms, and American Speech-Language-Hearing Association forums have recently revealed that many SLPs are struggling with the patient's right to decline. Many are not comfortable with the informed consent process and what entails patients' capacity to make their own medical decisions. Here, we discuss the basics of clinical decision-making ethics with intent to minimize the clinician's discomfort with the right to refuse those thickened liquids and eliminate the practice of defensive medicine.",0,1
"People living with chronic illness experience impairment in various ways, not the least of which is how they are sometimes marginalised by the people with whom they interact. Over the last few decades, as social science research has moved away from the biomedical model, research methodologies have been developed to allow the voices of people with illness or disabilities to be heard and not only to be represented by others. However, these methodologies may not go as far in redressing power imbalances as was hoped, and participants’ voices are often still mediated and subjugated to the researcher’s requirements. As a person who has lived with a chronic condition all my life, I am concerned about how I am heard and by whom, as this has often affected my self-perception and sometimes even my safety. I am also concerned about doing violence to those about whom I speak and disempowering them further. My doctoral research concerned the problematic of writing about my own experience of a chronic illness. I chose a methodology, autoethnography, that allowed me to write solely about my own experience. In so doing, I was able to consider the complexity of my own academic and narrative voices, individually and in combination. In this paper I explore the methodological and epistemological concerns around my decision to use autoethnography, as well as the sometimes surprising issues I navigated when doing so. One of these issues was the juxtapositioning of different types of texts I had written. In isolation, some of the texts show a clear influence of the very discourses to which I was trying to provide counter-narratives. When read together with other texts, they reveal a complex web of paradoxes, tensions, and silences, which allowed me to generate new narratives and to question assumptions – my own and other people’s.",0,1
"REVIEWS167 Language and culture in Native North America: Studies in honor of Heinz-Jürgen Pinnow. Ed. by Michael Dürr, Egon Renner, and Wolfgang Oleschinski. (Lincoln studies in Native American linguistics, 2.) München & Newcastle: Lincom Europa, 1995. Pp. x, 483. Reviewed by S0ren Wichmann, University of Copenhagen This festschrift for Heinz-Jürgen Pinnow was originally intended for his 65th birthday but was delayed just long enough to appear on his 70th birthday. It contains thirteen papers on Athapaskan, Tlingit, Haida, Hokan, Siouxan, Iroquoian, and Uto-Aztecan. In addition, there are three anthropologically oriented papers (excluded from the present review.) The book concludes with a bibliography of Pinnow's works and a curriculum vitae. For the reader who wants to acquire an appreciation of the essence of Pinnow's contributions to Na-Dene studies 'The methodological background to the Na-Dene controversy' (102-22) by Michael Dürr and Gordon Whittaker will be a good place to start. The authors, although clearly predisposed to giving a positive assessment of Pinnow's scholarship, manage to present a reasonably balanced discussion of the positions of scholars who have been unwilling to accept Pinnow's view, continued from Sapir (1915), that Haida is related to Tlingit-Athapaskan. They counter the argument set forth by Michael Krauss, Victor Golla, Jeff Leer, and Sarah Thomason that Haida may be some kind of a hybrid language by pointing out that 'if a hypothesis of hybridization is claimed to provide the solution with respect to Na-Dene, the kind of hybridization involved in this particular instance has to be specified' (110). They note that Pinnow (1985) was able to summon 25 verbal grammatical cognates shared between Haida and Tlingit-EyakAthapaskan ; that he pointed out the existence of suffixes that induce contrastive tone in Haida and Tlingit; that he showed how nouns, though to a lesser extent than the verbs, do have morphological similarities; and that all languages compared align possessive pronouns with verbal object pronominals , a typological feature not otherwise attested in the Northwest. Pinnow has also made progress in the more recalcitrant area of lexical comparison by comparing word families. This methodology is inspired by Pinnow's view that Haida, like Tlingit and Athapaskan, predominantly has monosyllabic morphemes. By comparing single Haida stems which are synchronically unanalyzable with the monomorphemic lexemes of Athapaskan and Tlingit, it is difficult to discover cognates. But by using Pinnow's methodology, which is a kind of simultaneous application of the techniques of internal and external reconstruction, progress is possible. A paper by Michael Dürr and Egon Renner (4-18) briefly reviews the various opinions that have been voiced concerning the genetic relationship among the group of languages that Sapir (1915) called Na-Dene. Ever since Sapir suggested that Haida, Tlingit, and Athapaskan are genetically related there have been skeptics. Pliny Goddard and Franz Boas were among the early opponents. Major breakthroughs came in the 1960s when Michael Krauss showed that Eyak is related to Athapaskan and when Pinnow was able to substantiate the view that Tlingit is related to Eyak-Athapaskan. The latter view was slow to gain acceptance, but even Krauss, who had been a staunch opponent, was converted by the early 1980s. Dürr and Renner are upset because consensus has still not been reached concerning the inclusion of Haida. But this state of affairs only seems natural, considering that only Dell Hymes in the mid 1950s and Pinnow in the mid 1980s have invested any major effort in trying to verify the hypothesis. Pinnow himself has a brief addendum (20-25) in which he places himself between the position of extreme splitters and that of extreme lumpers and makes various comments on some recent works in long-range comparison involving Na-Dene. Egon Renner's massive 'The structure ofthe Na-Dene controversy: A meta-theoretical explanation ' (26-101) takes up the same issue as the previous paper by Dürr and Renner but goes into more detail. On the basis of ideas about the structure of scientific communities and sociological conditions for research adopted from Ludwik Fleck and Thomas Kuhn, Renner tries to explain why the field of diachronic Na-Dene research has developed...",0,1
"- Cet article propose, dans une perspective epistemologique heritee des travaux de Gaston Bachelard et de Georges Canguilhem, une analyse du « depassement » jakobsonien de la distinction saussurienne synchronie/diachronie. Nous soutenons la these de la « coupure saussurienne », et lisons la distinction saussurienne synchronie/diachronie comme une distinction de portee a la fois epistemologique et theorique: elle permet la constitution du concept de langue, sous le double aspect d'une definition radicalement nouvelle de la langue comme fonctionnement, qui inaugure une problematique veritablement linguistique, et de l'elaboration d'un objet scientifique permettant de rompre avec l'empirisme, l'historicisme et l'organicisme de la linguistique anterieure. En regard, la distinction jakobsonienne synchronie/diachronie nous semble symptomatique d'un retour a l'empirisme - d'une part avec la notion d'etat de langue et la construction de la langue comme support d'integration structurale de la diversite empirique, d'autre part avec la definition de la langue comme instrument de communication, restant dans la problematique traditionnelle des rapports son/sens - et a des conceptions que la coupure saussurienne a perimees comme ideologiques: organicisme et problematique de l'origine. Il nous semble des lors possible de poser que le « depassement » jakobsonien de la distinction saussurienne synchronie/diachronie equivaut, par rapport a la theorie saussurienne, a un recul sur le plan scientifique, puisque d'une part il fait fond sur une non-theorisation de la langue, et que d'autre part il se situe du cote de l'ideologie plutot que de la rationalite.",0,1
"Speech and language disturbances have been observed from the early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD), including mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and speech analysis has been expected to help as a screening tool for early detection of AD and MCI. However, the questions of whether and how automatic speech analysis, including speech recognition by a self-administered tool, can be used for such detection remain largely unexplored. In this study, we performed automatic analysis of speech data collected via a mobile application from 114 older participants during cognitive tasks. The goal was to classify AD, MCI, and cognitively normal (CN) groups by using speech features characterizing acoustic, prosodic, and linguistic aspects. First, we evaluated how accurately linguistic features could be automatically extracted from transcriptions generated by automatic speech recognition (ASR), and we found that the features were highly correlated (r = 0.92) with those extracted from manual transcriptions. Then, a machine-learning speech classifier using these features achieved 78.6% accuracy for classifying AD, MCI, and CN through nested cross-validation (AD versus CN: 91.2% accuracy; MCI versus CN: 87.6% accuracy). Our results suggest the utility and validity of using a mobile application with automatic speech analysis as a self-administered screening tool for early detection of AD and MCI.",0,1

"Abstract Within U.S. higher education, there has been concern expressed about the underrepresentation of racial/ethnic minority students in U.S. study abroad programs. Though as a whole these students participate in study abroad at lower rates than their Caucasian counterparts, the fact that study abroad participation is even problematized by race/ethnicity (rather than other social categories such as gender, socioeconomic status or field of study) and the manner by which this is done warrant critical investigation. Drawing upon Foucault's concept of problematization (1984, 1988), this paper examines the discourses and practices (both discursive and nondiscursive) that mark current study abroad literature in which participation by U.S. undergraduates is tracked, categorized and ranked by race and ethnicity. It further problematizes the taken-for-granted assumptions that masquerade as truths and inhabit the methodological and analytical practices that govern research on racial and ethnic minority students, and in the process, uncovers an overarching code of thought that permeates the literature. Ultimately, this paper seeks to challenge the “truths” and counter the assumptions upon which this code of thought is based by highlighting those voices only marginally recognized in study abroad participation literature. These voices provide a local and contextualized perspective on the factors contributing to the lower rates of participation among one racial/ethnic minority category: African Americans. Although the paper does not take up the topic of language learning in study abroad contexts, it does present the real world challenge of language-in-use. It addresses the material and subject effects that a problematization of study abroad participation by race/ethnicity has on students, research practices, institutional and governmental policies, and the allocation of resources related to language study and the promotion and support of study abroad.",0,1

"This article explores how `social harmony' as cultural performance, is conducted by Chinese in their conversation at the surface level, with turbulence and manipulation concealed beneath superficial politeness. Although their more collective cultural orientation may lead them to greater cooperation and less confrontation, Chinese also develop artfully crafted messages to communicate competition and frustration. Selected discourse samples collected in Taiwan were analyzed in depth to show how social harmony may become a matter of external display, constructed, enacted and negotiated through participants' verbal exchanges in their moment-to-moment interaction. It is concluded that superficial harmony allows the extensive web of interpersonal connections and hierarchical positioning to be maintained with minimal discord, while at the same time concealing underlying aggressiveness and ulterior motives.",0,1

"The number of Asian immigrants in the United States has increased remarkably over the past decades and now accounts for nearly 30% of all immigrants in the country. However, the umbrella term Asians includes a wide range of variety. Acknowledging diversity among Asians, this study explores advantages of Asian bilingualism in the American labor market by attending to employment status and personal earnings through the lens of superdiversity. A series of logistic and ordinary least squared regression analyses of the 2011–2015 American Community Survey (ACS) data shows that substantial differences exist across different ethnic groups among Asians. Bilingual advantages appear in most Asian groups when predicting both employment status and personal earnings, and the benefits tend to be more salient in the results of earnings analysis. The findings indicate that native-language literacy skill is a more momentous variable than the other variables in the model and that bilingual advantages stand out among Asian Indians and Chinese/Taiwanese more substantially compared to other Asians. Immense gender gaps also exist between Asian males and females in terms of economic well-being, and such gaps are more conspicuous in personal earnings than in employment status.",0,1

"Este articulo examina la ironia en espanol de acuerdo con algunas teorias pragmaticas: Grice, Relevancia, Teoria del Fingimiento, Teoria de la Manifestacion Implicita y, finalmente, la pragmatica neogriceana. El grupo de investigacion GRIALE (http://www.griale.es) ha investigado los indicadores y las marcas ironicos, de acuerdo con una interpretacion neogriceana (vease Levinson 2000, Rodriguez Rosique 2009, Ruiz Gurillo y Padilla 2009). En contraposicion a otros modelos pragmaticos, tales como el eco en la Teoria de la Relevancia (Wilson y Sperber 2004, Wilson 2006), la explicacion neogriceana muestra que la ironia es una inferencia de caracter particularizado que invierte los principios pragmaticos (C>M>I). En primer lugar, la transgresion de la cualidad puede alterar el trabajo estandar de los principios conversacionales por medio de, por ejemplo, las marcas prosodicas. La violacion de la cualidad puede invertir el trabajo pragmatico del Principio de Cantidad, que puede ocasionar que el significado de una oracion sea el contrario del sentido de las palabras tomadas de manera literal (ironia prototipica). Indicadores ironicos como los cuantificadores (guapisimo) o los sufijos (poquito, ritmazo) invierten las ICP. La transgresion explicita de la cualidad puede afectar al Principio de Manera. Expresiones marcadas (tales como las unidades fraseologicas, las metaforas o el cambio de codigo-registro tecnico/informal) invierten las inferencias. Finalmente, la violacion explicita de la cualidad puede alterar tambien el trabajo pragmatico del Principio de Informatividad. Para multiplicar los referentes, se implican indicadores como la polisemia o la homonimia. Un enunciado ironico en espanol puede mostrar diferentes indicadores y marcas (prosodia, risas, cuantificadores, unidades fraseologicas, polisemia, etc.).

"The rajaz meter of Hausa is based on syllable quantity. In its dimeter form, it deploys lines consisting of two metra, each usually containing six moras. A variety of metra occur, and the key analytic challenge is to single out the legal metra from the set of logically possible ones. We propose an analysis, framed in maximum entropy optimality theory, that does this and also accounts for the statistical distribution of metron types, varying from poem to poem, within the line and stanza. We demonstrate a law of comparative frequency for rajaz and show how it emerges naturally in the maxent framework when competing candidates are in a relationship of harmonic bounding.",0,1
"1 60Reviews The Professor and the Madman: A Tale ofMurder, Insanity, and the Making of the Oxford English Dictionary. By Simon Winchester. New York: HarperCollins. 1998. xvi + 242. $22.00 Ti 1 he Professor and the Madman is one of a recent spate of small books which, by dint of providing an immensely entertaining read, have familiarized a mass readership with some relatively unknown or unglamorous corner of knowledge. The story of an American surgeon's involvement with the compilation of the OxfordEnglish Dictionary (OED) , which might not at first glance seem a promising topic on which to write a bestseller, looks less odd when we consider some of the other byways illuminated by similar books in recent years: the commercial exploitation of cod, for example, or the natural history of the tulip, or the search for a proof of Fermat's Last Theorem, or the invention of the chronometer. There appears to be a sly nod at the last of these in Simon Winchester's book, in the course of a survey of various signs of the standardizing impulse which flourished in the eighteenth century, and which also bore lexicographical fruit in the form of Samuel Johnson's Dictionary: ""[W] hat, indeed, of the precise measurement of longitude, so vital to seamen ?"" (92). As luck would have it, what Dava Sobel's Longitude is toJohn Harrison and the chronometer, Winchester's book is fast becoming for William Minor and the OED: more readers are learning about each subject from these authors' books than from any other source. The similarity now extends to plans for both books to become movies, which will of course magnify this effect even further. In fact, the story of Dr. Minor, the madman of the title, turns out to be a tale worth telling. The bare facts are these: William Chester Minor was born in 1834 in Ceylon, the son of Congregationalist missionaries from New England ; he graduated in medicine from Yale in 1863, and joined the Union forces as a surgeon in the Civil War; following various traumatic war experiences , including having to brand an Irish mercenary for desertion, elements of paranoia began to appear in his behavior, and he was in due course institutionalized ; in 1871 he was released, and arrived in London at the start of what was hoped would be a recuperative year traveling in Europe; however, only three months after his arrival he shot and killed a man under the delusion that he was one of the many Irishmen that Minor believed were out to get him; he was found not guilty of murder on grounds of insanity, and was consigned to the new asylum at Broadmoor, in Berkshire; some years later, news reached him of the OED, and of the appeal for voluntary help launched in 1879 by its then editor James Murray, and he undertook to read and excerpt quotations from the rare books he liked to collect; he thereafter maintained a close working relationship with Murray and the Dictionary over the next two decades, until failing health obliged him to stop work; he returned to America in 1910, and remained in custody until his death in 1920. Regular readers of Dictionaries will be familiar with Dr. Minor's story from an article by Elizabeth Reviews161 Knowles (1990), although the new book contains much new biographical information . A detail not mentioned in either of these places which has recently come to my notice is the fact that Minor worked on the 1864 edition of Webster 's Dictionary, ""in the departments of Geology, Natural History, &c,"" in collaboration with the Yale mineralogistJames Dana: I hope that Simon Winchester will be able to report on this earlier lexicographical episode in a future edition of his book. Interesting as Minor's life may be in its own right, this brief summary hardly suggests that, lexicographically, his story is likely to be an exceptional one. For a start, the number of people known to have provided quotations for the first edition of the OED runs well into four figures; many of the contributors were active for longer than Minor, and many made a numerically larger contribution. (The latter list is headed by one Thomas...",0,1

"■ La cooperacion de los trabajadores es un factor fundamental para la elevacion de la productividad. La pura racionalidad instrumental individual se revela incapaz para comprender este fenomeno, como tampoco otros, tales como la huelga o la organizacion sindical, que son inexplicables si se adopta como criterio interpretativo el movil del beneficio individual. La “racionalidad comunicacional” (Habermas), que permite la coordinacion de la accion por el juego de normas eticas y morales, permite entender mucho mejor este fenomeno paradojico. La organizacion del trabajo cuasimilitar tipica del inicio de la fabrica capitalista, se revelo insuficiente para asegurar la cooperacion de los trabajadores. Algunos grandes industriales buscaron la integracion de los trabajadores a traves de dispositivos paternalistas, que modificados y bajo formas diversas se mantienen en el regimen fordista.

"Data from 60,223 clients of MissNowMrs.com were used to identify predictors of women retaining their premarital surname as a middle name when changing their last name to that of their husband after they were married. Among women who changed their last name to that of their husband, 18 % kept their former last name as a middle name. We identify four significant predictors of women keeping their surname as their middle name: education, marital age, race, and region of residence. As their education level increased, women were significantly more likely to keep their surname before marriage as a middle name. Marital age had a curvilinear relationship with this naming choice. African Americans were significantly less likely than whites to use their birth name as a middle name while other women of color were significantly more likely than whites to follow this practice. The birth surname as middle name pattern was most common in the South, suggesting a regional cultural influence.",0,1
"In relevant logics one can formally distinguish two logical operators, symbolised as ┌A ∨ B┐ and ┌A + B┐. Addition holds for ‘ ∨ ’ and Disjunctive Syllogism for ‘ + ’, but not vice versa. The question arises, whether this distinction between two different formal notions of disjunction can be found in natural reasoning. First it is necessary to rebut Quinean objections to any rival to classical logic, Crice's claim that an intensional disjunction is not needed to explain the everyday uses of or, and Kempson and Cormack's argument that there can be no ambiguity between putative readings one of which entails the other (for A + B ⊢ A ∨ B. Finally Jackson's use of assertibility-conditions to defend the thesis that if ┐A then B┌ is equivalent to ┌A ⊃ B ┐ is rejected, but the notion of robustness which he introduces is usefully adapted to show why Disjunctive Syllogism must fail for ‘∨’, Having cleared the ground in this way, two uses of or are considered which have in everyday reasoning the inferential properties of ‘∨’ and ‘+’, thus defending the relevantist claim that or is ambiguous.",0,1
"The aim of this paper is to illustrate the potential of a parallel corpus in the context of (computer-assisted) language learning. In order to do so, we propose to answer two main questions (1) what corpus (data) to use and (2) how to use the corpus (data). We provide an answer to the what-question by describing the importance and particularities of compiling and processing a corpus for pedagogical purposes. In order to answer the how-question, we first investigate the central concepts of the interactionist theory of second language acquisition: comprehensible input, input enhancement, comprehensible output and output enhancement. By means of two case studies, we illustrate how the abovementioned concepts can be realized in concrete corpus-based language learning activities. We propose a design for a receptive and productive language task and describe how a parallel corpus can be at the basis of powerful language learning activities. The Dutch Parallel Corpus, a ten-million word sentence aligned and annotated parallel corpus, is used to develop these language tasks.",0,1
"L’objectif de cet article est de tenter, grâce à une expérimentation, de dresser un bilan des relations entre la prosodie et les différents domaines de la linguistique (syntaxe, sémantique) et de la pragmatique. La prosodie exerçant la fonction de véhiculer l’interprétation du sens que le locuteur accorde à son discours, la méthode qui est proposée est de définir des modèles linguistiques qui se prêtent à une quantification de telle manière qu’ils puissent à la fois fournir une stratégie interprétative des contenus linguistiques et également prédire une structuration mélodique de la trame lexicale. En nous appuyant sur les résultats d’une expérimentation montrant les liens entre d’une part les contraintes propres au texte, à la situation de discours et ses phases, et d’autre part la distribution des modèles et des indices mélodiques, nous définissons la prosodie, et plus précisément la mélodie, comme un lieu subjectif d’instanciation d’une dimension linguistique ou pragmatique dans un espace de nature pragmatique.",0,1
"In this paper, I present a modification of the scale-based framework of Sauerland & Stateva (2007, 2011) for modelling granularity—more precisely, of the so called granularity functions. Briefly, a granularity function maps a degree of a scale to an interval containing it such that the points within that interval are mutually indistinguishable. The proposed modification is a generalisation of the original framework suited for application in a wider range of domains, and it also fares better in overcoming some formal problems in modelling granularity-sensitive phenomena and vagueness.",0,1
"Professionals working in international companies in Sweden are expected to speak, read, and write in Swedish and English in their daily work. This article discusses professional writing in different languages. Through the use of methods from linguistic ethnography, we aim to enrich the understanding of workplace literacy by studying writing and texts in multilingual business contexts. Our results show that professionals are expected to navigate between a translanguaging mode and a more monolingual mode in everyday communication. Also, when they opt for producing monolingual texts, literacy practices that surround those texts are often multilingual. Moreover, they imagine a future, secondary audience for their texts, often resulting in the choice of English for reaching out, or in the choice of Swedish as a way of keeping matters local. Knowing when to choose a translanguaging mode or a more monolingual mode is a necessary skill or competence in this type of workplace. Our results also show that the use of multimodal resources includes the material placement of texts, and that old materialities such as pen and paper are still essential. Different linguistic and semiotic resources are used, including resources from academic, business and personal discourse.",0,1

"This study examined the role of relevance determinations within the context of undergraduates’ multiple text reading and writing. In this study, undergraduate students were randomly assigned to one of two experimental conditions (i.e., to compose a research report about either the causes of or the solutions to the urban housing crisis), using a library of 12 digital texts (six more relevant and six less relevant to students’ assigned task condition). Guided by the Multiple Documents Task-Based Relevance Assessment and Content Extraction (MD-TRACE) model, we identified the key features that students included in their task models, used log data to profile students’ text selection justifications and navigation, and categorized students’ writing as task-relevant or not. As such, we found students’ relevance determinations to play a key role in forming task models prior to text access, selecting and navigating texts during multiple text use, and composing a task product after accessing multiple texts. While we did not find students’ initial task models to be associated with their patterns of text selection justifications or navigation nor with writing performance, we did find differences in writing performance across students belonging to different text selection justification and navigation profiles. Implications for theory and research on learning from multiple texts are discussed.",0,1
"Wordnets have been created in many languages, revealing both their lexical commonalities and diversity. The next challenge is to make multilingual wordnets fully interoperable. The EuroWordNet experience revealed the shortcomings of an interlingua based on a natural language. Instead, we propose a model based on the division of the lexicon and a language-independent, formal ontology that serves as the hub interlinking the language-specific lexicons. The ontology avoids the idiosyncracies of the lexicon and furthermore allows formal reasoning about the concepts it contains. We address the division of labor between ontology and lexicon. Finally, we illustrate our model in the context of a domain-specific multilingual information system based on a central ontology and interconnected wordnets in seven languages.",0,1
"There is no third face of agreement Alex Alsina and Boban Arsenijević The main claim of Alsina & Arsenijević 2012a, hence forth A&A, can be stated as in 1. 1. There is no evidence for the idea that there are three potentially distinct sets of features needed for accounting for agreement facts—two syntactic sets and one semantic set. The kind of argument that would show this claim to be false or incorrect is one that presents a fact, or a set of facts, that can only be explained by positing two syntactic sets of agreement features, in addition to the corresponding semantic information, that is, that requires the 2SAH (the dual syntactic agreement hypothesis). None of the arguments in Wechlser & Zlatić 2012, henceforth W&Z'12, is of this kind. The arguments in W&Z'12 are mostly about possible problems that the analysis in A& A might face when applied to constructions not discussed in A&A. A&A focuses on hybrid nouns in Serbo-Croatian (S-C), since such nouns have been the main source of argumentation for the 2SAH in Wechsler & Zlatić 2000 (W&Z) and related work, and states generalizations within the 1SAH that account for the agreement facts involving such nouns. The argument in W&Z'12 based on the data in their examples 2-3 and 5 simply indicates that syntactic gender has a default association with semantic gender, in which masculine corresponds to male and feminine to female.1 The argument illustrated by example 4 in W&Z'12 shows that syntactic number, like semantic gender, has a default semantic correlate, by which plural signals more than one entity, and that this semantic value emerges in certain constructions, such as the appositive construction in the example.2 If singular agreement is shown to be the default choice for finite verb agreement, as argued in W&Z'12 on the basis of subjectless sentences and clausal subjects, all we need to do is to rephrase the statement about agreement in A&A's 4 (p. 373) so that it reads: 'A plural verb form is required if the subject is plural, either semantically or syntactically; otherwise, a singular form is used'. When the syntactic head triggering agreement is of a category that does not carry the features involved in agreement, such as a clause, an infinitive, or an adverb (see W&Z'12 exx. 6 and 8), singular agreement is predicted.3 As can easily be seen, all of these observations are not arguments for the 2SAH and are perfectly compatible with a theory that assumes the 1SAH. The one instance in which the 2SAH seems to allow for a simpler statement than the 1SAH concerns personal pronouns. In W&Z, personal pronouns are said to agree with their antecedents either in index features or in semantic features. In the proposal in A&A, pronouns agree with their antecedents either syntactically or semantically, with syntactic agreement restricted to nominative case forms. The statement in W&Z avoids this restriction, but it hinges on the homophony of all neuter plural forms of pronouns [End Page 388] with some other form: the nominative with the nominative feminine singular, and the remaining forms with the masculine/feminine plural form of the same case value. The price for dispensing with that restriction is (a) the massive complication that the 2SAH represents and (b) the stipulation that pronouns agree in index features, and not in concord features, with their triggers. And no empirical gain follows from this. In addition, restrictions relating case form to the choice of semantic or syntactic agreement are needed anyway, because relative pronouns allow semantic agreement only in certain case forms, as shown in W&Z (p. 819) (see Alsina & Arsenijević 2012b for an account). W&Z'12 defends the neuter plural analysis of certain elements such as the pronoun ona agreeing with deca-type nouns by referring to Corbett (1983), rather than presenting the particular arguments. But A&A already explicitly takes care of these arguments, showing that they either are fully compatible with the feminine singular analysis of those elements or are based on incomplete empirical generalizations (as in the case of...",0,1

"The notion 'drift' plays an important role in the development of the modals have to and must in early Canadian English in relation to British and American English during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Have to is first found in texts that reflect informal usage, and for the period in question (1750–1849), have to is only attested with deontic readings; the data suggest that its rise was not exclusively conditioned by the defective paradigm of must. Must maintains its epistemic function in relation to its Late Modern English competitors. In early Canadian English, changes progress gradually, with individual variables following different directions. Canadian English epistemic must lags behind, while deontic have to has spread more quickly in North America, with Canadian English more progressive than British English varieties, but less so than American English. Within a more general drift towards have to, Canadian English shows independent development in successive periods. La notion de derive ('drift') joue un role important dans le developpement des modaux have to et must dans la periode initiale de l'anglais canadien par rapport aux anglais britannique et americain au cours de la fin du XVIIIe et le debut du XIXe siecle.

Must retient sa fonction epistemique par rapport a ses concurrents de la periode posterieure de l'anglais moderne contemporain. Dans la periode initiale de l'anglais canadien les changements progressent de fac¸ on graduelle, et les variables suivent diverses directions.

The agility improves with time and growing skills but could be fostered in the future by formalizing training of meta-therapy skills for voice therapy as advocated by Helou et al.[1] On top of that, 2020 required from patients and SLPs alike an unprecedented level of adjustment and situational flexibility and preparedness due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Local theories of consciousness state that one is conscious of a feature if it is adequately represented and processed in sensory brain areas, given some background conditions. We challenge the core prediction of local theories based on long‐lasting postdictive effects demonstrating that features can be represented for hundreds of milliseconds in perceptual areas without being consciously perceived. Unlike previous empirical data aimed against local theories, localists cannot explain these effects away by conjecturing that subjects are phenomenally conscious of features that they cannot report. We also discuss alternative explanations that localists could offer.",0,1
"Abstract The history of twentieth-century linguistics is remarkable for the number of linguists who initially accepted a particular theoretical framework within which to conduct their studies, only to find that the framework in question constituted a straitjacket from which they had to struggle free. The case of Roman Jakobson is particularly instructive in this respect, for his interests were always too diverse to fit neatly into any set of pigeonholes, even his own. In order to understand the Jakobsonian heritage for linguistics we must first understand what Jakobson made of his own linguistic inheritance. The same holds mutatis mutandis for any scholar and any discipline.",0,1
"The article presented here employs the new tools of constructional analysis in order to evaluate the antiquity of the famous Homeric expression λιποῦσ’ ἀνδροτῆτα καὶ ἥβην ‘leaving behind manliness and youth’ (Il. 16.858, 22.363), which is usually regarded as a deep archaism preserved within the poetic diction, possibly going back to pre-Mycenaean times. As these new tools suggest that the expression belongs to a recent layer in the poetic technique, and is unlikely to preserve centuries- old linguistic features, this paper explores a scenario of how the aberrant form ἀνδροτῆτα (along with its irregular scansion) might have been created within the ancient written tradition of the text, and it proposes a likely emendation, which is supported by several philological and linguistic considerations.",0,1
"This article addresses the role of verbal protocols and cooperative dialogue in assessments of L2 pragmatic competence from the perspective of Vygotskian sociocultural theory. Whereas verbal protocols reveal important information about learner response processes, cooperative dialogue in the Zone of Proximal Development yields even more detailed developmental profiles that include emerging competencies and, at the same time, promotes their continued growth. A case study of one U.S. university learner of French, Susan, illustrates how cooperative dialogue during a series of assessment tasks administered over the course of six weeks simultaneously revealed and promoted her developing understanding of the pragmatics of social closeness (i.e., familiarity, solidarity), with specific focus on second-person address forms: tu ‘you-informal/intimate’ vs. vous ‘you-formal/distant.’",0,1
"Speech recordings made in vehicles with hidden recording devices (“bugs”) present a number of peculiarities compared to high-quality direct microphone recordings, and also ordinary mobile phone recordings. Inspired by a recent court case the present investigation was undertaken to quantitatively assess the effect of three types of covert recordings, including data transmission, on a widely-used forensic automatic speaker recognition (FASR) system (Batvox 3.1). Using simultaneous high-quality re-recording of speech samples from 50 speakers played back inside four automobiles and one 5-ton RV as a benchmark, equal-error rates (EERs) between zero and 2 % were found. The latter number was obtained for GSM-transmitted voice data. When the acoustic data were not transmitted but stored inside the covert recording device, or recorded and stored on a smartphone placed inside the vehicles, EERs between zero to 0.45 % were obtained. Generally, EERs are similar to those obtained using the same FASR system in studies with non-covert recordings (direct recordings, landline and mobile telephone). No effect of the type or model of the vehicles on EERs was observed.",0,1

"A case of childhood acquired aphasia with epilepsy (AAE) is reported because of unusual epileptologic and psycholinguistic features. Epileptic seizures were extraordinarily polymorphous, including especially at 4 years 8 months an episode of epilepsia partialis continua. The most striking feature of EEG data was absence of notable activating effect of sleep. Comprehension was never completely lost and seemed partially related to an auditory—verbal unawareness or neglect. Expression deficit was principally a difficulty in naming tasks, and above all prolonged latencies filled with a song-like prolonged vocalization during this task and more rarely in spontaneous speech. There was an anosognosia of these vocalizations. Beside difficulties in naming tasks, major expression disorders were constantly of phonological nature. Word repetition disorder was significantly more severe than both expression and comprehension defects (picture naming and pointing tests). Cases of AAE reported in the literature are heterogeneous, and there is currently no satisfactory explanation of association of an acquired aphasia with epileptic disorders, and no established correlation between a certain type of psycholinguistic defect and a definite clinical or at least electrophysiological epileptic disorder. An effort to define more precisely both psycholinguistic and electro-clinical epileptic disorders might lead to a much needed nosologic classification of AAE.",0,1
"ABSTRACT Recent proposals on language aptitude have distinguished between cognitive aptitudes for implicit and explicit learning (e.g., Doughty et al., 2010; Linck et al., 2013). This methodological study extends recent work on aptitude by investigating whether aptitudes for implicit and explicit learning are differentially related to the two main information-processing cognitive styles proposed by dual-process theories in cognitive psychology: rational–analytical and experiential–intuitive (Pacini &amp; Epstein, 1999). A relationship was found between a rational–analytical profile and explicit aptitude, as well as between an experiential–intuitive profile and implicit aptitude. Structural equation modeling further showed that the proposed model had acceptable fit. These results were interpreted as support for the qualitatively different types of cognitive processes underlying the two hypothesized types of aptitude.",0,1

"We investigated whether the mean duration of syllables in utterances of different length in Brazilian Portuguese conform to Menzerath–Altmann’s law. Furthermore, by analysing the same spoken material of twenty recorded speakers, we tested for individual differences in the parameters used to formalise the law. The log-transform of the syllable duration was the dependent variable in a linear mixed model with the log-transform of the number of syllables in the utterance as a predictor. Adding a random intercept accounted for the variability across the speakers, but a random slope by speaker did not improve the model. We conclude that Menzerath–Altmann’s law fits our data well, but the decreasing tendency is not different from speaker to speaker.",0,1
"Cognitive archaeologists infer from material remains to the cognitive features of past societies. We characterize cognitive archaeology in terms of trace‐based reasoning, which in the case of cognitive archaeology involves inferences drawing upon background theory linking objects from the archaeological record to cognitive (including psychological, symbolic, and ideological) features. We analyse such practices, examining work on cognitive evolution, language, and musicality. We argue that the central epistemic challenge for cognitive archaeology is often not a paucity of material remains, but insufficient constraint from cognitive theories. However, we also argue that the success of cognitive archaeology does not necessarily require well‐developed cognitive theories: Success might instead lead to them.",0,1
"One of the most important topics in current work on consciousness is what relationship it has to attention. Recently, one of the focuses of this debate has been on the phenomenon of identity crowding.

In this article, we draw upon a range of empirical findings to argue against Block's interpretation of the data. We also argue that current empirical evidence strongly supports an interpretation of the data that emphasises cognitive inference over conscious perception.",0,1
"Under the guise of a book review, Stephen R. Anderson (1989) has written a thoughtful critique of attempts by linguists and psychologists to collaborate in a venture called cognitive science. The general thrust of Anderson's argument is that psychologists ignore linguistic discoveries when building their theories of cognition and, evenhandedly, that linguists have neglected to explain the implications of their discoveries in a form that psychologists could appreciate. As one who has frequently worked in the cracks between these two disciplines, I am moved to add my own perspectives on the issues that Anderson raises. The problem of interdisciplinary communication has been around a long time, but not until the late 1970s did it command everyone's attention. A philanthropic program conceived by Kenneth Klivington and adopted by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation offered financial support for something that they called cognitive science. Since the offer presupposed a unitary science of cognition, interested parties were financially motivated to create one. Many interdisciplinary conferences followed. I once described one of those conferences as follows (Miller 1986:279):",0,1
"Abstract Job burnout is a synthetic syndrome of emotional exhaustion, depersonalization and reduced personal accomplishment. It has a time-linked and situation-specific nature by developing gradually and fluctuating with changes of environmental contributors. In this study, four related diary entries were analyzed narratively, written by a polytechnic teacher teaching English for General Purposes (EGP) in a semester, to verify the possible work-related situational factors causing job burnout of EGP teachers in the Chinese context. The results revealed ten environmental burnout elements, including overload, severity of students’ problem, lacking supervisors’ support, limited job autonomy, a stern hierarchical organizational system, and opaque operating rules. We interpreted the results in terms of teacher professional development and proposed that enhancing EGP teachers’ professional identity and revaluing the EGP course in polytechnics were the basic ways to mitigate burnout and improve English teachers’ professional development.",0,1
"Generally, human brains can grasp intuitively the gist of thematic content of different texts through comprehensive reading, and such human-like generalization process may be accomplished with a more exact basis. With three representative text types in Chinese and English from two comparative corpora as our focus, that is, LCMC (the Lancaster Corpus of Mandarin Chinese) and Frown (the Freiburg-Brown Corpus of American English), this study compares thematic characteristics of these texts with PAM (Partition around Medoids) and HA (Hierarchical Agglomerative) clustering via three quantitative indicators, namely, TC (Thematic Concentration), STC (Secondary Thematic Concentration) and PTC (Proportional Thematic Concentration). The results show that: (1) eigenvectors standing for the thematic characteristic of three text types can be clustered into their corresponding categories in both Chinese and English; (2) two contributing factors are identified for the clustering results. One is the differences of TC, STC and PTC values of three text types lying in different hierarchical levels; the other is the differences of the percentages of ‘thematic words’, especially nouns at the pre-h-point and pre-2 h-point domain in three text types. The characterization of three text types as thematic-intensive (Official Document), thematic-balanced (News) and thematic-dispersive (Fiction) bears a cross-linguistic similarity in both Chinese and English.",0,1
"Abstract YouTube is a popular social media platform that fosters the development of social bonds between viewers and YouTubers called parasocial relationships (PSR). These relationships might be associated with both viewer characteristics, such as social anxiety, and YouTuber video characteristics, such as self-disclosure. Additionally, PSR might be associated with the level of addiction to the platform. Data from 370 college students were extracted from a previous study and 360 videos of 72 YouTubers were coded to (a) explore the different dimensions of PSR and (b) examine a mediation model of YouTube addiction. The results support the existence of three PSR dimensions. The results also showed that PSR dimensions were associated with both viewers’ social anxiety and YouTubers’ evaluative self-disclosure. One PSR dimension was positively associated with YouTube addiction. This study encourages the development of qualitative studies to more precisely identify the different facets of PSR with social media figures.",0,1

"Anthologies of poetry are a key way to preserve, promote, and disseminate poetic works (Korte 2000), and an anthology of sign language poetry is an ideal way to achieve these aims for this still underrepresented aspect of Deaf culture, yet there are very few sign language poetry anthologies in existence. In this article, we describe some considerations needed to create such anthologies, based on our experiences of creating sign language poetry anthologies in British Sign Language (BSL) between 2009 and 2012 (much of which may be found at www.youtube.com/user/signmetaphor/videos) and in Brazilian Sign Language (ongoing at https://antologiaslibras.wordpress.com/). We begin with attempts to define the parameters of “sign language poetry” and “anthology,” and then consider the potential target audiences of a sign language poetry anthology. We also report on some of the challenges in creating and selecting content, inclusion of any headnotes or commentaries, the ordering of materials, and issues relating to technology. We conclude that, while no anthology of sign language poetry can satisfy all criteria, it is useful to model collections along guidelines adapted from those for written poetry anthologies, but that with changes in technology future-proofing the works needs particular attention.",0,1
"A growing body of research demonstrates the links between communication impairment and psychological difficulties including depression, anxiety, other affective disorders, anger, and aggression. Research has demonstrated high levels of psychological disorders in conditions such as stroke, traumatic brain injury, Parkinson's disease, autism, and specific language impairment, and communication impairment among individuals with psychiatric conditions. There are also demonstrated links between communication impairments and psychosocial functioning. However, there has been less research into how speech language therapists (SLTs) perceive the psychological and psychosocial difficulties of patients with communication disorders, and how they address these difficulties within the course of SLT interventions. This survey-based research study investigated the perceptions of SLTs working in New Zealand as to the impact of psychological and psychosocial difficulties on their clients, and whether this varied depending on the SLTs’ training, their experience and their access to psychology within their team. Respondents commented on the impact of psychological and psychosocial difficulties on their clients and family/whanau, and on their perceptions of what could benefit SLTs in addressing these difficulties within the context of SLT scope of practice. Of the respondents 29.3% reported that roughly 50% or more of their clients had significant psychological difficulties, and 51.2% reported that roughly 50% or more of their clients had significant psychosocial difficulties. No correlation was found between the years of experience of SLTs, or their access to psychology for their clients, and their perceptions of the psychological and psychosocial needs of their clients. Overall 76.5% of respondents reported that they did not feel prepared by their initial SLT training to address the psychological needs of their clients, and 77.5% reported that they felt SLTs needed more training to be able to adequately manage these needs within the context of SLT sessions.",0,1

"The notion of specificity in linguistics is notoriously non‐specific. We consider here various distinctions within the realm of noun phrase semantics that are relevant to specificity. The common thread uniting these distinctions is the notion of variation in value assignments for the variable introduced by the noun phrase. The distinctions concern the nature of the variation involved. The first part of the paper (section 2) is devoted to the definite/indefinite divide and proposes a dynamic parameter of ‘determinacy of reference’ which attempts to capture what is common to uniqueness and familiarity approaches to definiteness. Section 3 is devoted to a typology of indefinites in terms of constraints imposed on evaluation properties of the variable they introduce. Based on properties of special indefinites discussed in the literature on Hungarian, Lillooet Salish and English, I argue that a constraint based account of special indefinites is to be preferred over ambiguity‐based approaches.",0,1

"Abstract A famous exception to the ‘phonetic spelling system’ of Welsh is the use of &lt;y&gt; for both /ǝ/ and the retracted high vowel /ɨ(:)/. This double use of &lt;y&gt; was almost universally adopted by c . 1330, when a grammarian labelled /ǝ/ and /ɨ/ as ‘dark y ’ and ‘clear y ’ and illustrated them with polysyllables such as ystyr /ˈǝstɨr/ ‘meaning’, in which the value of &lt;y&gt; was predictable from the position of &lt;y&gt; in the word. At that time the three‐way system of for /i(:)/, ‘dark’ &lt;y&gt;, and ‘clear’ &lt;y&gt; was two centuries old, being first attested in Braint Teilo (‘The Privilege of St Teilo’), c . 1130. Yet the ‘Teilo’ system is rarely attested before c . 1300; instead all three phonemes might be represented by , as commonly before 1100, or by &lt;y&gt;; or &lt;e&gt; might be used for /ǝ/ and/or for /ɨ(:)/, as had sometimes occurred in Old Welsh as well. This article argues that one reason, apart from scribal conservatism, for the delay in adopting the ‘Teilo’ system was its failure to distinguish the value of &lt;y&gt; in proclitics such y /ǝ/ ‘the’ and y /ɨ/ ‘his/her’ and ‘to’. For this the ultimately abortive ‘Caligula’ system ( c . 1250) had offered a solution.",0,1
"My introduction to the Name Society almost did not take place. I taught at the Georgia Institute of Technology from 1961 to 1995. When the chairman of the English Department retired, he happened to ask me if I would like his copies of Names. Never one to turn down a free book, even without knowing its contents, I accepted. Thus began the delightfully enriching association with ANS and those who make it a truly unique group. I submitted a paper on medical terms and soon was on my way to the meeting in San Francisco, the first of many. Immediate acceptance has always been the distinguishing characteristic of the Society. Margaret Bryant and Lurline Coltharp invited me to sit with them, introducing me to other members and making me feel a part of the group. No one ever seemed left out. It is a group where inclusion is inherent. People of all ages and all backgrounds and all interests find the topic of names intensely interesting. When I was gathering information for my ANS presidential address in 1986, respondants to my questions were intrigued by the whole idea of South and Southerners. Those two words-which seemed so self-evident to me-suddenly took on meanings depending on the perspective of the person responding. Questions about place-the South-elicited references to a variety of geographic areas around the core states, with anything south of Indiana one of the more amorphous ones. Foods, terms, attitudes, feelings, impressions-all provided additional insights into the many ways in which work. Research with names, whether of medical terms or places or groups of people or everyday activities or items, provides endless opportunities for today and for the future. The new words lists give only a small hint of the changing language, the dynamic naming process. Words can",0,1
"Résumé Depuis quelques années, les recherches en phraséologie se développent autour de grands corpus oraux et proposent par exemple d’examiner les phrases préfabriquées des interactions.

Cependant, il existe peu d’investigation de corpus et peu de propositions didactiques relatives aux apprentissages des unités préformées en langue première. La présente contribution entend dès lors s’intéresser aux usages des phrases préfabriquées des interactions par de jeunes locuteurs natifs, afin de contribuer au développement d’une réflexion quant à l’acquisition des phraséologismes en langue première.

"In this paper, we propose a reduced complexity stochastic joint source-channel coding system developed for efficient and robust coding of wideband speech ISF (Immittance Spectral Frequency) parameters. Initially, the aim of this encoding system was to achieve a transparent quantization of ISF parameters for ideal transmissions over a noiseless channels. It was designed based on the switched split vector quantization (SSVQ) technique and called “ISF-SSVQ coder”. After that, our interest was drawn to the improvement of the ISF-SSVQ robustness for transmissions over a noisy channel. To protect implicitly our ISF coders, we developed a stochastic joint source-channel coding system based on a reduced complexity version of the channel optimized SSVQ technique. Simulation results will show that our new encoding system, called ISF-SCOSSVQ coder, can provide a good implicit protection to ISF parameters. The ISF-SCOSSVQ coder was further used to encode the ISF parameters of the Adaptive Multi-rate Wideband (AMR-WB, ITU-T G.722.2) speech coder operating over a noisy channel. We will show that the proposed ISF-SCOSSVQ coder contribute significantly in the improvement of the AMR-WB performance by ensuring a good coding robustness of its ISF parameters.",0,1
"We argue against the claim put forward by Lasnik (1976) that pronouns are, in all cases, pragmatically controlled, i.e. that they directly refer to objects or situations in the world. In fact, the generalization we defend is exactly the opposite: all pronouns are linguistically controlled, i.e. they have a linguistic antecedent in all cases. Even in those instances where no antecedent is present in uttered discourse, the necessity of postulating such an antecedent, and the possibility of identifying it, can be demonstrated. An antecedent which is not present in uttered discourse is subject to particular recoverability conditions, both pragmatic (it must be controlled by a salient object) and linguistic (the pronoun which is controlled by such an absentee antecedent can only occur in a restrained class of discourse contexts)",0,1
"Abstract Age is one of the key variables in the field of language variation and change (LVC). The vast majority of experimental work generally views a speaker's date of birth—chronological age—as a good reflection of both their social age, for example, which generation they identify with and how strongly and their biological age, that is, the physiological age of their body. This paper aims to provide the reader with tools to tease apart these three ways of conceptualising the variable of age. It reviews qualitative and quantitative methods from fields adjacent to LVC that will enable linguists of different theoretical interests to tap into biological and social aspects of ageing. In doing so, it provides a practical manual for linguists wishing to work from a more multifaceted understanding of one of the key variables in many linguistic subfields.",0,1
"Death has always been a major concern of humanity since the beginning of history, and finding the secret of immortality and escaping death has become the subject of many myths and ancient stories. Among philosophers who have addressed the subject of death, Heidegger addressed not only immortality and life after death but also the nature of death during one's existence. In his view, man (which he named Existence) through death becomes aware of his finitude, and thus, Heidegger chooses human beings as the only way of understanding existence among creatures. Heidegger critiques the philosophy of his predecessors and traditional metaphysics and defines his final thought as understanding existence. In his view, the most authentic thought about existence comes from wisdom, and that thought can begin when human beings believe that the idea of a saviour among the centuries is the largest enemy of original thought. In his view, death is the most original form of the possibility of Existence that threatens the entire universe, so the existence understood by the notions of the way to be in charge of his own life. “Heidegger” is trying to show the truth that man (Existence), unlike any other living creature, is terminally affected by destruction and death. (Evans, 1998, p. 212). This paper also discusses Heidegger's ideas about death.",0,1
"Based on the naturalistic data from four children (aged from 00;10 to 02;06) and experimental data from 60 children (aged from four to eight years old) and 15 adults, the study proposes that Mandarin speakers’ judgment about the scope assignment between negation and universal quantification is attributed to the interplay of several influential factors: word order, lexical semantics of logical expressions, structural complexity, conversational implicature, and felicity in the use of negation. Knowledge about the vital importance of word order in the grammar of Mandarin-speaking adults is not initially present in the grammar of children, but is gradually acquired. They initially rely excessively on lexical semantics in interpreting scope, sometimes leading to non-adult interpretations. Full mastery of scope knowledge comes when they become fully aware of the prominent role of isomorphism, at age 6 or 7.",0,1

"The study of both the personal name Ἀριουντίας recently published (SEG 49, 489, a c. 500 BC dedication, of which is given here a new edition) and the Laconian theonym ἈριOντία in the record of Damonon’s horse-races victories (IG V 1 213, Sparta, late 5th BC) corroborates Bechtel's etymology of the latter: he linked the theonym to a place called ἀρία, as near the Arcadian Orchomenos, i. e. ‘holm oak’, a species including the φελλόδρυς. Thus, Ἀριοντία would have been a dryad, whose name had had a toponymic origin, without any connection neither with Arion the poet nor with any popular etymology trying to explain the name as linked to ‘running’ and meaning ‘the fastest’, from *ἀρι-Fιοντ- or *ἀρ-ιοντ-. Another interest of the name Ἀριουντίας comes from the quality and quantity of the vowel before the -nt- of the *went- Suffix: we see that it was long and its timbre closed very early in the dialectal Corinthian area or even in Elis, as it was later in the 4th century BC, through the Doric North-Western area. Since there is no sure evidence of -/oe/- hypheresis in the Laconian dialect, we are thus allowed to suppose a long vowel also in the genitive Ἀριο̄ντίας of Damonon’s victories record. If the median vocalism of Ἀριουντίας was Elean, we would have there the most ancient evidence of the local use of the <OY> digraph to write the secondary /o:/, as it expanded from Corinthos. It would be another argument for the evolution postulated by G. A. Sheets: according to him dialects which illustrated the so-called Doris severior would have belonged first to the Doris mitior.",0,1

In this article the various compilation aspects are examined and illustrated by means of one onomasiological sub-field, namely the days of the week.

"<p class=""p1"">This paper follows up on some of the phonetic assumptions underlying earlier discussions in the phonological literature of the vowel reduction in Brazilian Portuguese such as Crosswhite (2004) and Flemming (2004), among others. We investigated various reflexes of prosodic prominence across four positions: tonic, pretonic, posttonic, and word-final. The height of the low vowel /a/ in these contexts was also determined. We found that while duration readily distinguished among the first three positions (tonic &gt; pretonic &gt; posttonic), it failed to differentiate posttonic from final. Intensity was a better discriminator across all four positions. We also documented a height harmony between pretonic mid vowels and the following tonic resulting in a seven-vowel pretonic inventory that parallels the tonic*. The implications of these findings for metrical prominence and dispersion accounts of vowel reduction are considered.",0,1

"In American English, the intensifier totally presents a pragmatic use, in which it strengthens the speaker’s commitment towards the utterance (e.g. ‘The Bulls will totally make the playoffs’). This use has received considerably less attention than the canonical lexical contribution of the adverb (e.g. ‘the glass is totally full’). First, I rely on three acceptability studies to show that pragmatic totally is used only in discourse moves that allow for the possibility of not adding p to the Common Ground of the conversation—that is, subjective, outlandish and responsive assertions. Second, I propose that totally flags speaker’s meta-conversational belief that every continuation of the exchange should involve the addition of p, framing the analysis within Farkas & Bruce (2010)’s discourse model. The proposal allows us to account in a unified way for the different effects that pragmatic totally contributes, highlighting the intensifier as a window into how declarative sentences with different kinds of content—subjective, objective, outlandish—structure the conversation.",0,1

"Abstract It is widely recognized that plural morphemes and classifiers are in complementary distribution, being unable to co‐occur. Recent literature suggests a syntactic account for complementary distribution: A plural morpheme and a classifier realize the same functional head, and thus, they cannot co‐occur. The goal of this article is to examine whether this syntactic approach to the alleged complementary distribution is applicable to certain classifier languages. We review analyses for each of 3 classifier languages, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, where a plural and a classifier co‐occur. The reviewed analyses suggest that plural markers in these classifier languages do not realize the same head with classifiers (e.g., a plural instantiates Num/D in Chinese differently from a classifier), which accounts for its co‐occurrence with a classifier. This paper also discusses other approaches to the complementary distribution of plural morphemes and classifiers, for example, a typological view and a semantic view, and concludes that they may not account for the data in the languages under discussion.",0,1
"Twentieth century philosophy of science has been dominated by a view of language with a strong prejudice against psychology, even while empirical psychology has moved away from the nineteenth century philosophical psychology against which the prejudice was originally directed. This legacy is shown to dominate even in recent Kripke‐inspired efforts toward new theories of meaning. Its influence is argued to undermine prospects for making sense of such phenomena as scientific progress. Avoiding this consequence requires that we pursue a psychologically informed theory of meaning.",0,1

"A few months after his father's death in 1879 Henry Sweet moved from the family home, 140 Maida Vale, London, into lodgings at Mansfield Cottage in Hampstead where ‘the air … [was] very fine’ and where he could ‘get out into a very fine country in a few minutes’ (letter to Johan Storm of 27 November 1879). He was to remain there until his marriage in 1887. But for anyone interested in finding the Cottage today there is a problem since no building with this name exists now in Hampstead (there is however a Mansfield Place and a Mansfield Road). When Sweet wrote to Storm some years later on the occasion of a visit Storm was paying to England, he gave him instructions on how to reach Mansfield Cottage—‘… it is tolerably accessible from Woburn Place. There is an omnibus from Tottenham Court Road …’—and to help him find it drew a sketch-map (letter of 18 April 1884).",0,1

"How can we deal with trauma in a posthuman world? The 9th of September 2001 will be remembered as the day the world changed. The turn of the century in the Western world was signaled by this national trauma, but also by a change in the humanist paradigm that very much conditioned the way in which such trauma was experienced and represented. This article explores this intrasection in the works of Thomas Pynchon and Art Spiegelman as they struggle to account for 9/11 through two trauma narratives that signal a matching change in aesthetic approach. Its methodological innovation lies in the application of Karen Barad’s concept of “intra-action” to the humanities.",0,1
"It has often been noted that Violant de Bar, wife of Joan I and Queen of Aragon 1387-96, played an important role in the diffusion of humanistic or pre-humanistic culture in the Crown of Aragon. Indeed, Violant encouraged the spread of French customs throughout the kingdom, particularly the new literary currents that contributed to the study of classical authors, and in so doing appears to have caused a true cultural revolution. Her influence continued even after the death of King Joan in 1396. This essay attempts to determine the real cultural impact of Violant de Bar’s presence in the Crown of Aragon by answering the following questions: Did Catalan literary culture undergo a renewal in the 14th century brought about by Violant? Did Catalan humanism originate from a French rather than an Italian model? Was Violant’s legacy truly revolutionary, and what changes did it occasion in the literature produced in the peninsula between the late 14th and mid-15th centuries?",0,1
"The Revolution of English Lexicography O: John Simpson ine hundred years ago, on 22 June 1900, the Editor of the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), James Murray, made his way to the Sheldonian Theatre in Oxford to deliver the annual Romanes Lecture. His subject was The Evolution ofEnglish Lexicography, and he was giving the lecture at a time when, after sixteen years, publication of the OED had reached the letter/. During his talk, he reviewed the progress of English lexicography since the earliest Anglo-Saxon glossaries. He detailed the emergence of the first monolingual English dictionaries in the early seventeenth century and went on to examine the work of Bailey, Johnson, Webster, and the OED. That was an exciting time in the world of lexicography. The OED was well established as the premiere historical record of the vocabulary of English; the Grimms' Deutsches Wörterbuch (1852-1960) was making steady progress in Germany; the great Dutch dictionary, the Woordenboek der Nederlandsche Taal (de Vries, te Winkel, and others [1882-1998]), had been publishing relentlessly over the previous twenty years; Littré's Dictionnaire de la Langue Française (1863-1872) was finished; and many other major lexical texts were either in progress or had been completed throughout the academic world. Murray concentrated in his lecture on English lexicography and suggested that the historical method had reached a climax with his OED. He wrote carefully and painstakingly about the achievement, as the lecture drew to an end: Original work, patient induction of facts, minute verification of evidence, are slow processes, and a work so characterized cannot be put together with scissors and paste, or run off with the Dictionaries:Journal oftheDictionary Society ofNorth America 23 (2002) John Simpson speed of the copyist. All the great dictionaries of the modern languages have taken a long time to make; but the speed with which the New English Dictionary has now advanced nearly to the half-way point can advantageously claim comparison with the progress of any other great dictionary, even when this falls behind in historical and inductive character. Be the speed what it may, however, there is the consideration that the work thus done is done once for all; the structure now reared will have to be added to, continued, and extended with time, but it will remain , it is believed, the great body of fact on which all future work will be built. It is never possible to forecast the needs and notions of those who shall come after us; but with our present knowledge it is not easy to conceive what new feature can now be added to English lexicography [emphasis added]. At any rate, it can be maintained that in the Oxford Dictionary, permeated as it is through and through with the scientific method of the century , Lexicography has for the present reached its supreme development . (Murray 1900, 49) No doubt there is an element of self-congratulation here. For Murray the progression of English lexicography had led almost necessarily to the pinnacle represented by the OED. In his words, it was ""not easy to conceive what new feature [could] be added"" to the sum of achievement which the OED represented. So what were the features of the English dictionary to which no addition could be made, and has the last hundred years since that time opened any new avenues along which lexicography can develop? Many of the features to which Murray alluded can be dated back to an analysis which Richard Chenevix Trench laid before the Philological Society during the 1850s in On SomeDeficiencies in OurEnglish Dictionaries (1857/1860). This was the series of papers which provided the initial impetus for the compilation of what became known as the Oxford English Dictionary. By 1900 Murray would have had several classic lexicographical features in mind. A serious scholarly dictionary should contain the following: • more or less comprehensive coverage of the vocabulary of the language; • detailed documentary evidence for each usage from printed records, including the earliest known occurrence of each word and meaning; • clarification of the semantic development of each word over time through a hierarchical sense structure; The Revolution in English Lexicography • extensive demonstration of the etymological development of each...",0,1
"1. The classical Prakrit vowel system has been chosen as a starting point to study the history of the vowel system of Gujarati.l The evidence for the intervening stages is supplied by documents, and it is proposed to show how many phonemic systems have to be postulated for these intervening stages. The changes in the phonemic systems have, in turn, been followed by significant changes in the grammatical systems, thus providing us with more reliable data on the stages in the history of the Gujarati language. Statements about changes in the consonants have been excluded mainly because they are relatively few, and do not play a significant role in the changes in the grammatical system. Where the changes in consonant and vowel systems are interdependent, statements about consonant changes have been made. 2. The transition from OIA to MIA has been already described by Pischel, Bloch, Chatterji, and others. The most significant features of this change are merging of the OIA sonant r with MIA a, i, and u; reduction of OIA diphthongs ai and au to MIA e and o; and shortening of vowels under certain conditions. Thus, OIA r > MIA a, i, or u: krta> kaya 'performed', vrsabha> vasaha 'bull', vrsti> vutthi 'rain', drsti> ditthi 'vision'; OIA z > MIA z: vtra> vmro 'brave', szma > stma 'boundary', vtna > vzna 'a musical instrument'; OIA X > MIA i: parzksa > parikkha 'examination', jfrna> jinna 'tattered', vist1rya> vitthi .a 'spread'; OIA i > MIA i: dhigjwvita> dhijjfviya 'wretched life',",0,1
Shangaci is a Bantu language spoken in Mozambique by an ever-decreasing number of speakers. Like nearby Koti (Schadeberg and Mucanheia 2000) it is a Makhuwa variant that has been influenced by Swahili. The main part of this paper is dedicated to a description of the ways in which modality is expressed following the definition of modality as formulated by van der Auwera and Plungian (1998). The degree of formal homogenity of the modal system in Shangaci is discussed and special attention is paid to modal markers with multiple meanings. The relevance of van der Auwera and Plungian''s definition of modality for Shangaci is questioned.,0,1

In this article, we aimed to find out whether this holds for English learners’ interlanguage and whether the parameters in probability distribution of dependency distance can measure the language proficiency of second language learners. We selected 367 participants of English learners of nine consecutive grades and fitted different probability distribution models to dependency distances of their writings in English and of self-built contrastive dependency treebanks based on Wall Street Journal Corpus. It was found that: (1) the Zipf-Alekseev distribution well captures the probability distribution of dependency distance of each grade and native speakers; (2) the probability distribution of dependency distance well measures second language learners’ language proficiency at different learning stages; (3) high-level learners don’t present exactly the same parameters in the probability distribution of dependency distance as those of native speakers, which means learners’ language proficiency is not as high as that of English native speakers and second language learners’ syntactic acquisition process is always constrained by the tendency of dependency distance minimization. This study corroborates that quantitative linguistic methods can be well utilized in second language acquisition researches.",0,1
"A report on a survey of seven multinational companies in Germany. Since the 1990s, there has been a dramatic change in the structure of many large European companies. While previously many were ‘particularly solidly established in their countries of origin’ (Truchot 2002:14), they have now become multinational and are less identifiable with a particular country. A case in point is DaimlerChrysler, formed in 1998 through the merger of Daimler-Benz (a German manufacturer of motor vehicles) and the Chrysler Corporation (a US automobile manufacturer). A side effect of the rise of such corporations has been that English has become a key language of international business. This has certainly been true for DaimlerChysler, which has given English official status in the company",0,1
"Having lived in both Quebec and Newfoundland, without being native to either, I often note the similarities between the two that transcend linguistic boundaries: ancient settlement, isolation, survival, the sense of tribe, la nostalgie des Vieux Pays, the wealth of folk song and folklore, the strength of the family, the proud sense of identity with a place and with a history. This paper, then, starts with a reverberating comment from Jean-Paul Vinay, another CFA (a come-from-away, Newfoundland term for one who is not native-born) who was born across the Channel from me, and whose early training as an angliciste corresponds to mine in French language and linguistics. JPV wrote (1979:60): De même que les Québécois gardent encore une grande nostalgie de la terre, ils conservent en leur cœur un coin préférentiel pour la parlure des aïeux.

"Inequality comparative constructions are found amongst the so-called &#8220;negative polarity&#8221; contexts. Actually, it has often been suggested that comparison operations contain an underlying negation; in addition, comparative clauses form part of structures allowing for the presence of an expletive negation in some languages, like French or Spanish.In this paper, we intend to examine the comparisons which can present that supposed negative mark in French &#8211; ne &#8211; from a semantic perspective on the basis of certain assumptions from O. Ducrot&#8217;s polyphonic theory and from J.-C. Anscombre&#8217;s stereotypical theory. Specifically, the internal polyphonic structure of those sequences are analysed here as a conglomeration of points of view conveying argumentative instructions and a hypothesis is presented which accounts for the internal &#8220;negativity&#8221; of comparisons.",0,1
"Abstract Neoliberalism and neoliberal ideology has only recently begun to gain attention within applied linguistics. This paper seeks to contribute to this development with a focus on neoliberal keywords in official texts. The ideological content of these keywords can best be understood within the political project of neoliberalism and within the political economy of contemporary capitalism. Studies which have highlighted the marketization of institutional discourse have analysed this phenomenon from a discourse-based perspective, rather than seeing neoliberal ideology in language as a contradictory manifestation of wider social relations in periods of social crises. The appearance of ideology in language, this paper holds, is unstable, unfinished, unpredictable and dependent for meaning on what Dell Hymes characterised as the “persistent” social context. The ideology of neoliberalism, for all its apparent hegemony, is not guaranteed full consent, and this applies also to its presence in language. The question of social agency is crucial to understanding the social dynamic and unpredictability of ideology in language, both in terms of who produces neoliberal keywords and how they are received and understood. This paper argues that international think tanks, articulating the interests of capital, act as powerful keyword standardisers and their influence will be examined in the production of texts in the Irish university context. However, neoliberal keywords, in certain conjunctures, will also be contested, as will be shown. The paper concludes that applied linguistics is uniquely placed to both critique and challenge neoliberal keywords in the university and that such a challenge has the potential to find wider political resonance as governments, amid continuing economic recession, recharge the ideology of neoliberalism.",0,1
"Green’s Dictionary of Slang (GDoS) was published by Chambers in 2010, in a traditional print format in three massive volumes. This work superseded several earlier slang dictionaries by the same author and represented the culmination of a lifetime’s work studying the English slang vocabulary, from earliest times to the present day. Despite the fact that slang is primarily a spoken-language phenomenon, by 2010 Green had assembled around 400,000 citations for slang vocabulary words and phrases, through assiduous and indefatigable research relying largely on printed sources, especially surviving early broadsheets and (later) newspapers. Dictionary publishers have fallen on hard times in recent years. The business model for print publication of dictionaries has collapsed. Readers now prefer to search on-line sources for information about words, facts, usage, and meaning. Some people would say now, with the benefit of hindsight, that the traditional printed book was never the right medium for such a massive work of lexicographic scholarship. Comprehensive reference books are cumbersome, heavy things. Recognizing the inevitable, the lexicographer Jonathon Green very sensibly decided a few years ago to retrieve control of the rights (no mean achievement) and publish his magnum opus on line under his own auspices, through a company which he set up and called Abecedary Limited, with the assistance of a canny young database engineer, David Kendal. By the time you read this review, Green’s citation collection will have grown to nearly 500,000 items. In October 2016 the dictionary was published on line. It contains explanations of and citations for over 130,000 words and phrases, arranged under 55,000 headwords, and we are told that regularly updated versions are planned for as often as three times a year. This is an astonishing achievement. Among other things it establishes a new model for reference publication, from which it behoves other reference publishers, most of whom are, alas, stuck in the mud of traditional book-format publishing, to learn.",0,1
"This special issue examines the linguistic production of youth identities under conditions of cultural mobility. Building on theories of migration, transnationalism, and globalization that have emerged in anthropology, cultural studies, and other fields, the contributions to the special issue investigate not simply the large-scale cultural and political processes that shape the lives of youth but equally how youth identities emerge through the fine-grained details of interactional work and local linguistic practice. The introduction lays out the major themes that run through the special issue: the importance of scholarly attentiveness to the diversity of youth identities; the recognition of youth as social agents moving across national boundaries both physically and symbolically; the role of local ethnographic practice in investigations of global and transnational phenomena and especially the centrality of interaction as the primary site of social life; and the significance of language as a key resource for the articulation and negotiation of social identities, relations, and processes.",0,1
"AbstractThe camel’s cultural importance among the nomads of Arabia can be attributed to its critical role over the centuries in ensuring the people’s survival. Its status explains the herders’ detailed knowledge of the animal and their breeding expertise. As a result, an extensive classification system of camel naming prevails among Bedouin Arabs. The category names assigned, in particular to the females, serve as “information packages” that transmit traditional knowledge from one generation to the next. Apparent name-loss among a younger and more urbanized generation thus reflects an erosion of this once vital knowledge. It is hoped that recording a wide range of female camel names here, and documenting their classification, will help towards the preservation of such an important knowledge system.",0,1
"The current translation of σύγγραμμα as ‘monograph’ is the direct result of 19th-century scholarship, but this interpretation does not seem to conform to the evidence in the ancient sources. A diachronical examination of the occurrences of σύγγραμμα (from the 5th cent. BCE to the 3rd cent.

Despite its semantic complexity, the term shows in no case any intrinsic link with a particular literary genre.",0,1

"This paper addresses how the Wikipedia community has debated the existence of an EU culture on a Wikipedia discussion site between 2001 and 2019. That is, a corpus of discussions among Wikipedia editors (‘Wikipedians’) was examined to shed light on how the Wikipedians involved argue for/against the idea that an overarching EU culture exists at present. This, combined with an examination of debates about concrete cultural elements associated with the EU, permits an insight into Wikipedians’ conception(s) of the union. Drawing on argumentation analysis shows that the data examined indicates that cultural commonality across EU member states is not necessarily ascribed to the EU but to their being European countries. Additionally, even Wikipedians who argue that an overarching EU culture exists do not necessarily actually subscribe to this view but argue for reference to cultural elements in the Wikipedia article on the EU in order to signal to Wikipedia readers that the EU is “more than a set of treaties”.",0,1

"In two studies, we examined if correct and incorrect testimony statements were produced with vocally distinct characteristics. Participants watched a staged crime film and were interviewed as eyewitnesses. Witness responses were recorded and then analysed along 16 vocal dimensions. Results from Study 1 showed six vocal characteristics of accuracy, which included dimensions of frequency, energy, spectral balance and temporality. Study 2 attempted to replicate Study 1, and also examined effects of emotion on the vocal characteristic-accuracy relationship. Although the results from Study 1 were not directly replicated in Study 2, a mega-analysis of the two datasets showed four distinct vocal characteristics of accuracy; correct responses were uttered with a higher pitch (F0 [M]), greater energy in the first formant region (F1 [amp]), higher speech rate (VoicedSegPerSec) and shorter pauses (UnvoicedSegM). Taken together, this study advances previous knowledge by showing that accuracy is not only indicated by what we say, but also by how we say it.",0,1

"With the elimination of Circular 58 in 1967, the Ontario Department of Education has given the teachers of modern languages more freedom in the choice of the programme at the Grade 13 level. With this freedom, there also came a great deal of responsibility: the teacher will have to examine very carefuJ] y the reading material and be certain that it is of the correct interest level for his students. He will hope to find suitable textual material which will be supported by some audio or visual material. A recent survey conducted by the Executive of the East Niagara Modern Language Heads' Association 1 showed that a variety and multiplicity of French readers were being used at the Grade 13 level. Many colleagues have kept the complete progr:imme (or sections thereof) prescribed by the Ontario Department of Education in 1967- 1968. Others have digressed from that prescription. The following is a list of textbooks which resulted from that survey. The list has been supplemented with the addition of available audio, visual, reading and testing material. It is obvious that much of the reference material is beyond the Grade 13 level; it has been included here for the teacher's attention.

"Video-assisted self-reflection (VASR) has been identified as an effective pedagogical tool in teacher education, and yet it has been rarely researched in the context of teaching EFL students to make oral presentations (OPs). This study aimed at investigating the effectiveness of VASR in teaching EFL students to make OPs and the studentsâ perceptions of its pedagogical use. A quasi-experimental two-group pre-test post-test comparison design was used. The experimental group (n = 14) and the control group (n = 15) experienced the same instructional procedures for 14 weeks, while only the experimental group made VASRs. Two questionnaires were used as instruments, one completed by both groups first as the pre-test and then as post-test to investigate the effectiveness of VASR, and the other completed by the experimental group to examine studentsâ perceptions. The results suggested that VASR was effective in developing studentsâ use of non-verbal elements in communication and that students perceived VASRs as beneficial activities. A structured protocol was recommended to facilitate studentsâ VASRs and maximize its pedagogical effect. The findings have implications for the design of VASRs in teaching EFL students to make OPs.",0,1
"A noise-robust approach for blind multichannel identification is proposed on the basis of Kalman filter and eigenvalue decomposition. It is proved that the state vector composed of the multichannel impulse responses is nothing but the eigenvector corresponding to the maximum eigenvalue of the filtered state-error correlation matrix. This eigenvector can be computed iteratively with the so-called ‘power method’ to reduce the complexity of the algorithm. Furthermore, it is found that the computation of the inverse of the filtered state-error correlation matrix is much easier than itself, the wanted state vector can be computed from this inverse matrix with the so-called ‘inverse power method’. Therefore, two algorithms are proposed on the basis of the eigenvalue decomposition of the filtered state-error correlation matrix and its inverse matrix, respectively. In addition, for reducing the computing complexity of the proposed algorithms, matrix factorization such as QR-, LU- and Cholesky-factorizations are exploited to accelerate the computation of the algorithms. Simulations show that the proposed algorithms perform well over a wide range of the signal-to-noise ratio of the multichannel signals.",0,1
"In the literature, event metonymies have been used to explain how language users produce and interpret utterances in which certain events are understood in terms of their sub-events or the overall/complex events they are a part of. This paper attempts to discuss some pragmatic effects of event metonymies which, to the best of our knowledge, have not been explored to date.The first section deals with how certain expressions based on SUB-EVENT FOR EVENT metonymies can be considered synonymous for others in real communicative terms. We, therefore, show how a sound theory of synonymy could not only benefit from the incorporation of referential metonymies but also from the inclusion of SUB-EVENT FOR EVENT metonymies. The second section focuses on how EVENT FOR SUB-EVENT mappings have proven useful to achieve certain pragmatic relevance and mitigation/euphemistic contextual effects which have never been described in the literature. In order to do so, we analyzed a collection of more than 60 expressions (obtained from a study with two native speakers of English) to observe how they can qualify as event metonymies.",0,1

"Being a multilingual country rich in culture and diversity, South Africa has residents who use a variety of the 11 official languages for daily communication. Multilingual communication occurs especially in hospitals and clinics. People visiting healthcare facilities often struggle to locate a health professional that shares the same language or even a language which is similar to their own and thus intelligible to them. The research which is reported on here aimed to assist the University of Pretoria in its endeavours to address this situation by teaching students an additional language. This was done by providing three custom-designed, mobile-assisted Sepedi language learning applications to students from the Faculty of Health Sciences enrolled for the Sepedi language module, Sepedi for Beginners. The applications were specifically designed to assist students with the acquisition of vocabulary related to healthcare. The students used the applications as supplementary tools and gave feedback through a questionnaire, to establish whether the students perceived the mobile applications to be useful as a supplement to the course material and whether they had a clear preference for a specific application. The results of this study show a positive response to the applications, including strong preferences expressed by the participants.",0,1
"This study examines the narrative production of 12 trilingual children aged 8;7–11;10 in three languages: heritage Romanian as a first language, mainstream English as a second, and school French as a third. Narrative macrostructure was analyzed via the Narrative Structure Scheme, while microstructure was assessed via story length, lexical diversity, and subordination index. An additional microstructural measure was Guiraud’s index of lexical richness. Results were only partially compatible with monolingual or bilingual findings. Analyses demonstrated that: (i) group macrostructural strength was equal across languages but only as a central tendency; and (ii) while the correlation between Romanian and English macrostructure almost achieved significance, neither was related to French scores. Contrary to the findings of Heilmann et al.’s monolingual study, no microstructural component correlated with macrostructure. Within microstructure, there was no significant difference in sentence complexity (measured through the subordination index) across languages, but scores for lexical diversity and Guiraud’s index were lower in French than in Romanian and English. The findings point to distinctions between trilinguals and both bilinguals and monolinguals, and the possible problem with testing trilinguals for language proficiency or disorders using instruments created for monolinguals.Trial registration: Netherlands National Trial Register identifier: ntr-.",0,1
"Evidence for a DP-projection in West Greenlandic Inuit Abstract The goal of this paper is to argue in favor of a DP-layer in West Greenlandic Inuit noun phrases and in doing so contribute to the argument that the absence of overt D-elements is not directly indicative of the absence of a DP-layer. Inuit is a polysynthetic, ergative language with no overt articles; for this reason it has been argued that a D-head is unnecessary. Others have argued contrastively that a functional projection KP (Case) is necessary (often assuming DP). This paper differs from both camps in the sense that it considers syntactic features specific to D. I present three primary arguments in support of a D-head in West Greenlandic: (i) the D-head acts as the locus of agreement features in possessive DPs, (ii) the D-head is the locus of the syntactic/semantic feature of definiteness; and (iii) a DP-layer is needed to provide a landing site for movement in DP-internal word order variations.",0,1

"Part of speech (POS) tagging, the assignment of syntactic categories for words in running text, is significant to natural language processing as a preliminary task in applications such as speech processing, information extraction, and others. Urdu language processing presents a challenge due to the dual behaviour of various Urdu POS tags in differing situations (morphosyntactic ambiguity). This paper addresses this challenge by developing a novel tagging approach using linear-chain conditional random fields (CRF). Our work is the first instance of a CRF approach for Urdu POS tagging. The proposed model employs a strong, stable and balanced language-independent as well as language dependent feature set. The language-dependent feature considered includes part-of-speech tag of the previous word and suffix of the current word while the language-independent features includes the ‘context words window’. Our approach was evaluated against support vector machine techniques for Urdu POS—considered as state of the art—on two benchmark datasets. The results show our CRF approach to improve upon the F-measure of prior attempts by 8.3–8.5%.",0,1
"Recent scholarship within the field of applied linguistics highlights the fact that identities are not static but are fluid, multiple, changeable across time and space, and always constructed in relationship to interactions with others. In other words, identities are constantly in motion. This paper presents a framework for examining the notion of ‘identities in motion’ as a core analytic construct in understanding patterns of educational success and failure. This framework is contrasted with the implicit frameworks that have operated in many countries that consign notions of identity negotiation to the margins and focus on ‘educational effectiveness’ as a process of instructional and organisational efficiency in isolation from the historical and current social context.",0,1

When applied to Indo-European data, the statistic yields results in good agreement with common philological judgment. Problems of significance are discussed. Finally it is concluded that the statistical technique will both require and help to establish a taxonomy of languages.]",0,1
"Speech-language pathologists are frequently required to assess culturally and linguistically diverse children. Achieving culturally sensitive, valid, and clinically feasible assessment of children in this population can be challenging. Several assessment options are available; however, the literature lacks discussion around clinical reasoning and differential diagnosis using a combination of these options. This paper examines the use of a number of assessment techniques in combination for differentiating language difference from language disorder in early sequential bilingual children. In two cases, valid differential diagnosis is achieved by obtaining comprehensive information on each child's language learning context, then applying a range of culturally sensitive assessment techniques: peer–child comparison, composite scoring, and dynamic assessment. Two essential standards for evaluating bilingual language development are presented. First, formal tests used in isolation are insufficient for diagnosing specific language impairment in bilingual children: the use of alternative techniques is crucial. Second, diagnosis requires the implementation of a range of alternative assessment techniques. No single methodology provides a definitive conclusion of difference versus disorder. A range of assessments considered together, however, provide a strong body of evidence outlining a child's language abilities in their unique cultural context.",0,1
"986 LANGUAGE, VOLUME 60, NUMBER 4 (1984) Valla, Linacre, Scaliger, and Ramus, as well as of grammarians from the Judaeo-Arabic tradition in Spain. Part Two offers a lucid synopsis of S's grammar . The section consists offour chapters treating (a) parts of speech, (b) the syntax of nouns, (c) declensions of verbs and particles, and (d) figurative syntax and semantics. Throughout, BC does more than summarize: he interprets the significant aspects of the grammar, he contrasts S's approaches with those of his sources, and he refers to the secondary material dealing with the pertinent issues presented in the Minerva. Since grammarians prior to the late 19th century never wrote explicit descriptions of their philosophical assumptions, BC distills S's philosophy of language from the text of the JIf/nerva . S argued that language flowed from reason and logic, and that language was natural because it reflected nature. The function of the grammarian was to discover and express the laws of language in logical rules. Thus S's intention was 'to uncover the origins and logical structures ..., i.e. ""ideal"" forms, as well as the internal rules and principles ... of the Latin language ' (201). Since he was interested in universal as well as particular rules, the Minerva was more than a Latin grammar: S attempted to develop a sentence-based grammar from an understanding of the conceptual structure of the mind. BCs book is the result of quality historical scholarship. The documentation is never perfunctory : each part contributes to a reasonably argued whole. BC places S in his intellectual milieu by carefully drawing an accurate historical context. He resists all temptations to force modern linguistic terminology into Sanctius' grammar, or to justify the Minerva only to the degree that it resembles or foreshadows 20th century linguistic theory. [Joseph L. Subbiondo , Santa Clara University.] Latin linguistics and linguistic theory. Ed. by Harm Pinkster. (Studies in language, companion series, 11.) Amsterdam & Philadelphia: Benjamins , 1983. Pp. xviii, 307. This volume is ofparticular interest, states its editor (xv), not because of any addition to factual knowledge of Latin for the non-theoretical linguist, but because of the application of a variety of new methods to the study of this frequently neglected language. The papers were presented at the 1st International Colloquium on Latin Linguistics, held in Amsterdam in April 1981. They approach the language from a variety ofdirections—mainly syntax, but also text structure, morphology/phonology, semantics, and language acquisition. The last category alone would indicate the special interest the conference had for linguists, since Latin is not often the focus of second-language acquisition studies. Apart from the section on syntax, no part of the volume (and thus of the conference) has more than two articles; semantics, text structure , and what is labeled 'method' have only one each. The last category (an article on 'Kompetenz in der lateinischen Syntax' [pp. 3-8] by R. Pfister) deals with definitions of competence in an area which has no native speakers. There is one article on text structure, 'Conversation openings in the comedies of Plautus' by M. E. Hoffman, and one on semantics, an analysis of indefinite pronouns by A. Orlandini. The morphology /phonology section contains an autosegmental approach to degemination (O. S. PiIlinger ) and a phonemic/semantic categorization of tense morphemes in the verbal system (C. Touratier). The substantial chapter on 'Sentence structure ' includes thirteen papers devoted to Latin syntax. The predominant theory represented here is that ofGovernment and Binding, applied to anaphoric relations (Bertocchi and Casadio), the development of Latin case (Calboli), accusative subjects (Maraldi), and relatives (Maurel ). Another article on case (Carvalho) is presented in a Guillaumean frame, and one on the importance ofthe verb in the Latin sentence (C. Guiraud) is based on the work of Tesnière. The importance of this volume is at least twofold . For Latinists, it is an encouraging presentation ofthat language as a testing-ground and source of data for linguistic theory; the use of one's 'own' language is always a boost to language -specific specialists. For theoreticians, it is a reminder of another language—too often dismissed because of its lack of modern native speakers—which can be a fruitful area ofstudy, again to...",0,1

"In Fraseología Bilingüe: Un Enfoque Lexicográfico-Pedagógico Daniel Molina García offers a comprehensive monograph devoted to a progressively more attractive focus in lexicography: pedagogical bilingual phraseology. The book deals with phraseology in its pedagogical and lexicographical dimensions. Two ideas are central to Molina's book: firstly, phraseological units (PUs) are linguistic units of particular usefulness in second language teaching; secondly, dictionaries specialised in phraseology are adequate tools for learning PUs. The author is conscious of three specific gaps in lexicographical research: (1) While phraseology has been focused on more theoretically, its lexicographical perspective has not been studied in depth, especially as regards bilingual works. (2) This situation implies a subsequent gap in pedagogical lexicography. (3) Research on PUs has been undertaken mainly in the context of general dictionaries, but sufficient attention has not been given to phraseological dictionaries (PDs).

La actitud frente a la lengua adoptada por los periódicos, además de constituir una manifestación de la conciencia lingüística de sus dirigentes, desvela la línea ideológica de los rotativos en una época en que el agonizante Imperio Otomano estaba en pleno proceso de desmembramiento como consecuencia de los nacionalismos balcánicos, y los movimientos sionistas habían empezado a tomar fuerza en Europa.",0,1
"This paper reports the results of a usage-based study of gapping (as in “I ate fish, Bill [ ] rice, and Harry [ ] roast beef”), one of the most extensively studied syntactic constructions in English. Using the British component of the International Corpus of English (ICE-GB) as the database, our investigation demonstrates that gapping is an extremely marginal grammatical construction in English. It is virtually non-existent in interactive speech and has only a very limited presence in certain types of monologues and written registers. Syntactically speaking, gapping favors simple structures, linking and low transitivity verbal elements, and can ostensibly be deemed as copula-derived. From a discourse pragmatic point of view, information flow, social interaction, and stylistic functions are found to be contributing factors to the ways that gapping structures are constituted and used. Our study can thus be taken as evidence that an adequate understanding of the form and discourse functions of syntactic structures is best achieved through examinations of actual language use.",0,1

"In this article, I will show that Chinese verb copying constructions lend strong empirical support to Chomsky’s (2013) labeling theory. In particular, I will argue that the cooccurrence of the object and the postverbal complement in the vP domain gives rise to a symmetric structure of the type {XP, YP} that cannot be labeled by the labeling algorithm and that verb copying is derived from VP movement, a strategy which is applied to solve the labeling problem at the moment of Transfer. This new approach will provide a principled explanation for the core properties of verb copying constructions as well as some related phenomena.

"The study examines phases in developing specification of grammatical marking of emergent clause-combining (CC) as indicative of children’s growing ability to integrate two or more independent predications. To this end, both intra- and inter-clausal analyses were applied to all CC utterances produced by three Hebrew-acquiring children aged 2;0–3;0, covering both child autonomous productions and adult-child co-constructed CC. Based on four phases in CC construction shared by the three children, the following developmental trends were identified for both coordination and subordination in our database. First, children start combining two predications with lexical verbs early on, but these are confined to non-marked or adult-supported constructions. Second, early connective-marked CC involves mainly verbless copular or existential clauses. And autonomously produced lexical-verb combinations marked by connectives emerge several months later. This initial “trade-off” and gradual progression in grammatical specificity to full-fledged, lexically marked CC is interpreted as reflecting the developmental route of children’s early clause integration in interactive discourse.",0,1
"Some Remarks on Stress, Syncope, and Gemination in Mussau1 Robert Blust Abstract Contrary to theoretical expectation, Mussau, a language spoken in the St. Matthias archipelago in northwest Melanesia, has developed some geminate consonants through the loss of stressed vowels. It is argued that other considerations have overridden considerations of stress in geminate formation, not only in Mussau, but in many other Oceanic languages. Specifically, vowels tend to delete between identical consonants in partial reduplications, a tendency that accords closely with Odden's (1988) arguments against the Obligatory Contour Principle, particularly as it applies to antigemination. On the basis of fieldwork conducted in 1975, Blust (1984:174ff) reported the presence of geminate consonants in Mussau, spoken in the St. Matthias archipelago immediately to the northwest of the island of New Ireland in western Melanesia. These segments occur in both initial and intervocalic positions and, according to my earlier publication ""can … be attributed to a synchronic rule of syncope [that] deletes the vowel of the first of two successive identical syllables."" In most cases, alternative pronunciations were given in which the geminate consonant corresponds to a C1VC1- sequence; in other cases no such alternative was recorded. Longer forms were said to represent the speech of the older generation and syncopated forms the generation of my assistant, Uloulo Ainamangas (born ca. 1930). As it turns out, this description suffices for the derivation of initial geminates, as with [rarána] : [rrána] 'mangrove sp.', or [gigíma] : [ggíma] 'kind of tree used to make canoes', as well as for medial geminates in words that have just two identical syllables for older speakers, as [gorúru] : [górru] 'edible green seaweed', or [miróro] : [mírro] 'fish sp.', but it fails to account for medial geminates in words with three identical syllables such as [mumúmu] : [múmmu] 'to suck', or for the absence of syncope in invariant disyllables such as keke 'foot, leg', mama 'seaweed sp.' or susu 'breast'. [End Page 143] My Mussau material was collected in two elicitation sessions totaling about six contact hours. In this limited time, I was able to gather a vocabulary of between 550 and 600 words, and a small set of sentences. Tables 1 and 2 display all 32 examples of phonetically geminated consonants that appear in my fieldnotes. Except for kkiau, initial geminates occur only in surface disyllables, while medial geminates occur in words of two or more syllables. In addition, as might be expected, medial geminates outnumber initial geminates by slightly more than two to one. Juliette Blevins (pers. comm.) has pointed out that the Mussau material is puzzling in view of the fact that medial geminates sometimes appear to arise from the deletion of a stressed vowel. Her questions about these cases have caused me to reexamine my fieldnotes, with the result that I believe I can now state a more adequate set of conditions for deletion leading to gemination. These conditions are still surprising in the light of general theoretical notions about deletability or hierarchies of deletion probabilities for vowels, and for this reason they merit a brief notice here. We can begin by reformulating the rule of syncope: syncope in Mussau does not delete the vowel of the first of two successive identical syllables, as stated in 1984, but rather the first vowel between like consonants, counting from the right margin of the word. This enables us to account for cases like mumumu : mummu as well as for the initial geminates that were covered by the earlier rule. However, it still leaves us with two unresolved problems: (1) counterintuitively, it deletes a stressed vowel in forms such as miroro : mirro 'fish sp.' or mumumu : mummu 'to Click for larger view View full resolution Table 1. Mussau Initial Geminates, with Variants Click for larger view View full resolution Table 2.

"Abstract Cognitive gadgets puts forward an ambitious claim: language, mindreading, and imitation evolved by cultural group selection. Defending this claim requires more than Heyes' spirited and effective critique of nativist claims. The latest human “cognitive gadgets,” such as literacy, did not spread through cultural group selection. Why should social cognition be different? The book leaves this question pending. It also makes strong assumptions regarding cultural evolution: it is moved by selection rather than transformation; it relies on high‐fidelity imitation; it requires specific cognitive adaptations to cultural learning. Each of these assumptions raises crucial yet unaddressed difficulties.",0,1
"Psycholinguistic theories are based on a very small set of unrepresentative languages, so it is as yet unclear how typological variation shapes mechanisms supporting language use. In this article we report the first on-line experimental study of sentence production in an Australian free word order language: Murrinhpatha. Forty-six adult native speakers of Murrinhpatha described a series of unrelated transitive scenes that were manipulated for humanness (±human) in the agent and patient roles while their eye movements were recorded. Speakers produced a large range of word orders, consistent with the language having flexible word order, with variation significantly influenced by agent and patient humanness. An analysis of eye movements showed that Murrinhpatha speakers' first fixation on an event character did not alone determine word order; rather, early in speech planning participants rapidly encoded both event characters and their relationship to each other. That is, they engaged in relational encoding, laying down a very early conceptual foundation for the word order they eventually produced. These results support a weakly hierarchical account of sentence production and show that speakers of a free word order language encode the relationships between event participants during earlier stages of sentence planning than is typically observed for languages with fixed word orders.*",0,1

"The present study is an attempt at a comprehensive presentation of various functions in the reference system of Mandarin Chinese. The study demonstrates that the reference system of Mandarin consists of a finite number of functions, some of which have not been identified as such, namely: absence of instructions to identify the referent, marked by bare nouns (sometimes analyzed as ‘indetermined’); presentation of an entity as not requiring identification (sometimes wrongly analyzed as ‘indefinite’); co-reference with the last coded participant in the event or a participant in the speech situation (not identified as such in the literature so far); obviative reference with respect to the last coded participant in the event (not identified as such in the previous literature); a referent that is located within the space and time of the environment of speech; and a referent within the domain of speech. The importance of this study lies in demonstrating that the analysis of forms and functions in a given language, as opposed to checking if and how categories observed in other languages are coded, allows for the discovery of categories that are encoded in the grammatical system and whose existence explains the forms of utterances in the language.",0,1

"Proto-Micronesian Kin Terms, Descent Groups, and Interisland Voyaging1 Per Hage and Jeff Marck Abstract The historical method of comparative linguistics is used to reconstruct Proto-Micronesian kin terms. Linguistic evidence suggests that Proto-Micronesian society was matrilineal rather than bilateral as Murdock proposed in an early typological reconstruction of Micronesian society. The weakening or disappearance of matrilineal institutions in Micronesia is associated with the demise of regular long-distance voyaging. 1. Introduction. In a typological approach to culture history, Murdock (1948) argued that Proto-Micronesian society was ""Hawaiian"" in type, with generation-Hawaiian kinship terminology (parent = parent's same sex sibling, sibling = cousin, child = sibling's child), bilateral kindreds, bilocal residence, and the absence of unilineal descent groups. According to Murdock, matrilineal residence, matrilineal descent, and Crow terminologies (with generational skewing) and Iroquois terminologies (with separate terms for cross-cousins) were later developments. Murdock's reconstruction of Proto-Micronesian society was consistent with his more general reconstruction of Proto-Malayo-Polynesian society as Hawaiian in type. It was accepted by many anthropologists, most notably by Goodenough (1951:95), who wrote: ""That the Hawaiian type of kinship system was ancestral not only to the system now found in Truk but to those found throughout Micronesia has been demonstrated by Murdock (1949)."" Goodenough (1955) proposed a major amendment to Murdock's interpretation by adding, as a basic feature, the presence of cognatic landholding descent groups. Murdock followed the method of reconstruction outlined in Social Structure (Murdock 1949), arranging types of kinship systems in a purely logical sequence independent of any historical linguistic data. Without such data, however, it is difficult to give a typological sequence a temporal interpretation. The actual historical sequence in Micronesian societies may have been just the reverse of that postulated by Murdock, with bilateral Hawaiian (and patrilineal) features developing out of the matrilineal organization of Proto-Micronesian society. In this paper [End Page 159] we reconstruct Proto-Micronesian kin terms using the comparative method of historical linguistics. Linguistic evidence suggests that Proto-Micronesian society was matrilineal to begin with. The weakening or disappearance of matriliny is associated with the demise of regular long-distance voyaging. 2. Nuclear Micronesia. ""Nuclear Micronesian"" languages are those languages of geographical Micronesia that descend from ""Proto-Micronesian"" (PMC) and consist of all the languages of geographical Micronesia other than those of the western high islands (the Marianas, Yap, and Belau) and the Polynesian outliers, Nukuoro, and Kapingamarangi (figure 1). With the exception of three high islands in the Carolines—Pohnpei, Kosrae, and Chuuk (formerly Truk)—all the islands where Nuclear Micronesian languages are spoken are low islands, atolls and, in the case of Nauru, a raised reef structure. The region was settled by 2000 B.P. from Vanuatu or the Southeast Solomons (Kirch 2000).2 The center of linguistic diversity is in central-eastern Micronesia, implying earliest settlement in the eastern Carolines, the Marshalls, and Kiribati (Grace 1961, Blust 1984). However, the relative lack of linguistic differentiation in the Micronesian languages and the high level of voyaging technology suggest that settlements began spreading through the eastern and central islands and groups rather soon after the area was encountered and colonized (Bender and Wang 1985).3 Micronesian languages are Oceanic Austronesian languages of the Eastern Oceanic rather than Western Oceanic variety. They seem to have diverged quite early from Eastern Oceanic in Melanesia, but the source is not clear. Changes in sound systems give the appearance of affinities with northern Vanuatu languages, mostly those of the far north around the Banks Islands (Grace 1961). However, a few—but more diagnostic—sporadic sound changes and changes in morphology put the Melanesian source for Micronesian in the Southeast Solomons (Blust 1984), and the Cristobal-Malaitan group in particular. The special affinities are so thin that early divergence (about 1000 B.C.) is implied, but it is also possible that Micronesian diverged from languages that no longer exist, due to language replacement. Internally, except for Nauruan, the age of the group's common ancestor would seem to be on the order of 2000 to 2500 years B.P. Comparative linguistics suggests divergence from other Oceanic languages much earlier than this, but it is possible...",0,1
"In some neuropsychological disorders, distorted reports seem to fill gaps in people's memory of their past, where people's self‐image, history, and prospects are often enhanced. False beliefs about the past compromise both people's capacity to construct a reliable autobiography and their trustworthiness as communicators. However, such beliefs contribute to people's sense of competence and self‐confidence, increasing psychological well‐being. Here, we consider both the psychological benefits and epistemic costs and argue that distorting the past is likely to also have epistemic benefits that cannot be obtained otherwise, such as enabling people to exchange information, receive feedback, and retain key beliefs about themselves.",0,1

"In this research, we propose a theoretical framework integrating functional theories of attitudes and consumer motivations in the context of luxury consumption. As such, this research offers a unique perspective into the investigation of brand visibility in luxury consumption. Three experimental studies were conducted involving advertisements for a luxury brand (i.e. Gucci). For each study, respondents were drawn from a Qualtrics opt-in survey panel. The findings highlight the fundamental issue as to why consumers acquire luxury brands. That is, to construct a desirable self-concept by communicating central beliefs, attitudes and values to others (self-expressive) or alternatively, to gain approval in social situations (social-adjustive). Furthermore, this research shows that when consumers are exposed to an advertisement that espouses a value-expressive versus a social-adjustive function of attitude, they tend to prefer subtle versus explicit visibility as determined by their intrinsic versus extrinsic motivation. Some research has previously been undertaken investigating links between brand visibility and consumer motivation in the luxury context. This study contributes to this literature through the introduction and testing of moderating variables demonstrating that consumer preference for brand visibility is driven not only by consumer motivation but also by the perceived social function of luxury consumption. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.",0,1

"After hearing three lectures as part of a regular university course, students were asked to summarize the lectures. The lectures were graded for accuracy and completeness. Each one was taped, transcribed, and coded, using a coding system based on work by van Dijk and Kintsch (1983) and Meyers (1975a, 1975b). The hypotheses to be tested were: (1) The percentage, but not the number of propositions would correlate positively with the accuracy scores in the summaries. (2) Completeness scores would correlate positively with the total number of propositions, but the number and percentage of propositions coded as macropropositions would correlate even more highly. (3) Signaled propositions would be better remembered than nonsignaled ones. Hypothesis 1 was confirmed in the summaries of all three lectures; Hypotheses 2 and 3 were confirmed only in two of the lectures. Analyses of the errors, lexical substitutions, discrepancies in the grades assigned by the two coders, and differences in the students’ scores for the different lectures revealed interesting (and in some cases unexpected) results concerning lexical‐semantic networks and grading reliability.

"Abstract Cases of apparent V3 order in German finite main clauses are commonly attributed to remnant VP movement to SpecC. The remnant VPs posited in this approach are headed by a trace, left behind by a verb that evacuated from VP prior to the movement of VP. Müller (2018) argued that such remnant VPs are subject to a process of restructuring that removes the verb’s trace and reassociates the phrases that depended on that head prior to its removal. This commentary discusses novel observations about operator scope which lend further support to the remnant movement approach to apparent V3, but which at the same time are inconsistent with the assumption that remnant VPs in the German prefield are always subject to restructuring.",0,1
"Abstract Tonogenesis is a topic of perennial interest in Trans‐Himalayan linguistics (the name of the family is the subject of some debate. Other terms for the family are Sino‐Tibetan and Tibeto‐Burman). The phonetic origins of the tones of the many languages in the family, such as Tibetan (Huáng 1995), Burmese (Nishi 1999; Hill 2019), and Chinese (Haudricourt 1954; Sagart 1999) are relatively well understood. However, the phonetic origins of tone in many Trans‐Himalayan languages remains an open question (Sagart 2006). There has been a paucity of work describing the origins of tone in the languages classified as belonging to the Qiangic subgroup of Trans‐Himalayan.

"Abstract If the self is a container, then it very much matters what is in that container. The authors borrow from this self-as-container spatial metaphor to suggest that individual differences in implicit self-esteem, based on a spatial compatibility task, should predict somatic symptoms such as muscle soreness, headaches, and breathing difficulties. Specifically, lower levels of implicit self-esteem, as measured by the Implicit Association Test, should predict a higher frequency and intensity of somatic symptoms. This prediction was investigated in two studies involving a total of 157 undergraduate participants. As predicted, correlations between implicit self-esteem and somatic complaints were robust and negative in direction, as measured by a questionnaire designed to tap anxious arousal (Study 2), momentary (Study 1) and daily (Study 2) reports of somatic symptoms, and informant reports (Study 2). The findings are consistent with spatial metaphor in suggesting that lower levels of implicit self-esteem are associated with tendencies to internalize negative evaluations, in turn biasing bodily symptom perception.",0,1

However, a post-hoc analysis revealed a global comprehension effect for difficult texts but not for easy texts. Local effects were predominantly carried by the difficult texts as well. The direction of the effect did not vary between reading proficiency or readers’ educational level but did vary between types of coherence relations. Contrastive and causal connectives increased comprehension, whereas additive connectives reduced comprehension. Our large-scale study shows that effects of connectives on text comprehension are consistent between readers but not between texts and types of coherence relations.",0,1

This essay is an analysis of the rhetorical strategy employed by Silvio Berlusconi in his first Liberation Day speech, which illustrates an example of strategic maneuvering through shifting ideographs in political discourse, a rhetor’s persuasion technique that succeeded in manufacturing consent across an ideologically polarized audience. Strategically shifting ideographs by replacing &lt;Liberation&gt; with &lt;Liberty&gt;, Berlusconi successfully crafted a speech that was received favorably by most of the nation’s political forces. The center-left coalition interpreted the speech positively, describing it as a welcome and unexpected display of bipartisanship because of Berlusconi’s endorsement of the values of the Resistance; the center-right also praised Berlusconi’s speech because they saw it as a historical and partisan revision of Liberation; finally, only the radical extra-parliamentary left harshly critiqued it for what they saw as Berlusconi’s cynical efforts to exploit the celebration.",0,1
"Human social actors spend much of their time with other actors engaged either in attempting to manipulate those others into doing things for them—or in themselves being objects of such manipulation. While studies have been made of, e.g., compliance and persuasion, little attention has been paid to the verbal behaviors involved in manipulative acts in social interaction (or to labels of those behaviors). This paper constitutes a beginning step toward filling that gap by asking: (1) what sociological variables constrain selection of modes of verbal manipulation (and acceptable reports of manipulative strategies); and (2) how can the several strategies be mapped in a semantic space? It is shown that considerations of utility (valence and cost to interactants) and of relative power and affect in relations among participating actors are critical variables in choices among INSTRUMENTALITIES.",0,1
"Reviewed by: Diachronic Slavonic syntax: Gradual changes in focus Mila Vulchanova Björn Hansen and Jasmina Grković-Major, eds. Diachronic Slavonic syntax: Gradual changes in focus. Munich: Sagner, 2010. 208 pp. [Wiener Slawistischer Almanach, 74.] This volume is symptomatic of a recent trend in grammar studies marked by a revived interest in diachronic research from a theoretical perspective. This trend has been visible in the initiative to arrange a forum for linguists working within language diachrony using a formal analytical framework (mostly generative), which came to be established as the Diachronic Generative Syntax Conference (with its 14th meeting in 2012). This kind of work has been supported by the creation and wide availability of numerous electronic resources such as historical corpora, large scale databases of manuscripts for the study of language history. While most recent research has focused on the history of Germanic and Romance languages, with few exceptions (e.g., the recent publication Development of language through the lens of formal linguistics, 2010) research on Slavic diachrony is still relatively limited, sporadic, and scattered. In this respect the current volume is a welcome resource for linguists interested in the development of Slavic languages. It is the result of the conference ""Diachronic Syntax of the Slavonic Languages: Gradual changes in focus"" held in Regensburg in late 2008 and contains many of the papers presented at that conference, duly reflecting the diversity of topics and ideas aired there. The main organizing idea of the volume is the assumption that the processes that lead to major and observable changes in language are marked by smaller, gradual, and often subtle, transitions, which sometimes even point to conflicting trends. While the contributions all address various aspects of Slavic language history, they reflect a number of theoretical approaches, from formal (generative) to Construction Grammar, language typology, and grammaticalization theory. The book includes 17 papers covering Russian, Czech, and Polish, as well as the almost extinct Ruthenian and Lower Sorbian. Thematically, four of the papers report results and analyze data obtained from language corpora (Bartels, Eckhoff and Haug, Krasovitsky et al., and Rabus), [End Page 299] two address negation (Dočekal and Veselinova). Other papers look at the development of verbal categories such as gerunds (Bjørnflaten) and the perfect (Jung), properties and constituents of nominal expressions (Karlík for a specific category of adjectives and Fried for adnominal participial adjectives), and clause-level categories, such as modal adverbs (Hansen), the syntax of perfect auxiliaries (Migdalski), predicative possession (McAnallen), and reflexive constructions (Lazar). Some papers address more general aspects of diachronic change, such as the grammaticalization of nominal paradigms (Rappaport), the driving forces in the history of Slavic syntax (Večerka), and transitivity and syntactic structure (Grković-Major). The papers that draw on corpus data all share a common theme: the ways in which data extracted from historical corpora may shed light on changes that have been under way or have become visible over shorter (from a diachronic perspective) segments of time (e.g., 50 to 100 years). In this respect, the paper by Krasovitsky, Baerman, Brown, Corbett, and Williams entitled ""Morphosyntactic change in Russian: A corpus-based approach"" is of particular interest for the topic of the volume. In this paper the authors trace gradual changes in predicate agreement in Russian over the past two centuries. The syntactic contexts included in the survey are base orders, where the subject phrase precedes the verb phrase, expletive (impersonal) structures, where oblique phrases occur in clause-initial position, and sentences where the predicate precedes the (logical) subject. In addition, the semantic nature of the referents is taken into consideration, and animate and inanimate phrases are reported separately in the statistical analyses. Based on data from a large corpus of literary works, the following intriguing generalizations emerge: a radical increase of plural agreement with conjoined NP subjects; a similar, even farther reaching, change for quantified expressions containing the lower numerals (dva 'two', tri 'three', and četyre 'four'), but a very different pattern in the case of nominal expressions quantified by higher numerals (such as pjat' 'five' and above and quantifiers such as neskol'ko 'several' and malo 'few'. These patterns can be explained by the nature of the quantity...",0,1
"We investigated on the possibility of an active cancellation system for unnecessary speech radiation control. Some examples of the intended application of this system are cellular speech cancellation and speech input for recognition-based dictation systems. Both of these applications do not require speech to be radiated into surrounding space, but only into the input microphone, and would benefit if global radiation is controlled. We first show that speech cancellation is possible with a secondary source placed in proximity to the mouth generating linear-predicted phase-inverted speech. However, the prediction must also cover the long delay associated with the acoustic to/from electric conversion, as well as A/D, D/A conversions, and all associated processing, which we found could go up to as long as 3 ms. By using LPC predicted samples recursively to predict further samples, we found that prediction with SNR of about 6 dB is possible, even with this long delay. The prediction coefficient update is suppressed during this recursion. Lowering the sampling frequency in order to lower the number of predicted samples at the cost of reduced bandwidth further enhances prediction accuracy. At a sampling frequency of 8 kHz, speech emission control of about 7 dB for female speech and 4 dB for male speech was found to be possible. Finally, we experimentally evaluated the proposed active speech control method. Predicted samples of recorded speech was first prepared off line. We then actually played out both the original and the predicted samples simultaneously from two loud speakers. It was found that (1) speech cancellation of up to about 10 dB is possible, but is highly speaker dependent, (2) secondary loud speaker should be oriented in the same direction as the primary source, i.e., the mouth. We plan to investigate further to improve prediction accuracy using prediction coefficient extrapolation. A prototype system implementation using DSPs is also planned.",0,1

"Peters' Note highlights the tight interconnection between phonological advances and the child's discovery of morphosyntactic structure. Taking a constructivist view, or assuming no advance knowledge of what linguistic principles or parameters may be expected, investigators like Peters &amp; Menn (1993) or Veneziano &amp; Sinclair (in press) come to the conclusion that children must begin with the surface regularities of language, only gradually familiarizing themselves deeply enough, through use, with the make-up (as well as the situational cooccurrences) of commonly heard words and larger lexical patterns or constructions to begin to develop multi-level linguistic knowledge, i.e., to discover morphosyntax. In commenting on Peters' stimulating note on filler syllables we would like to draw on our cross-linguistic data for the late single word period to attempt to derive some further hints as to the difference input prosody may make and the kinds of transitional phenomena one may find.",0,1
"Although awareness and negative evaluation of stuttering are important information for the assessment and treatment of stuttering in children, little is known about what constitutional factors are associated with children’s level of awareness and evaluation of stuttering. Among possible factors, the present study attempted to study language ability in relation to awareness of stuttering and evaluation of stuttering in typically developing young children. Participants’ language ability was determined by a standardized language test and their awareness and evaluation of stuttering were determined by their expressed reactions to a video of two puppets, one speaking fluently and the other speaking nonfluently. Findings indicated positive relations between children’s language ability and their awareness of stuttering and between children’s language ability and their negative evaluation of stuttering. Furthermore, these relations were more observed in the 4-year-old group than other age groups. The findings may help clinicians to better understand the role children’s language abilities play in the development of their awareness and negative evaluation of stuttering.",0,1
"Agentive awareness is one's awareness of oneself as presently acting. Dominant accounts in cognitive science consider agentive awareness to be grounded in the states and processes underlying sensorimotor control. In this paper, I raise concerns for this approach and develop an alternative. Broadly, in the approach I defend, one is agentively aware in the virtue of intending to act. I further argue that agentive awareness is not constituted by intentions themselves but rather first‐personal thoughts that are formed on the basis of them. I develop this proposal, highlight some of its theoretical advantages, and show how it successfully meets various challenges.",0,1

"Abstract It has been hypothesized that postperformance memory gaps occur in highly skilled individuals because experts generally perform their skills without conscious attention. In contrast, we hypothesize that such memory gaps may occur when performers focus so intently on their unfolding actions that their ongoing attention interferes with long‐term memory formation of what was previously attended to, or when performers are highly focused on aspects of their bodily skills that are not readily put into words. In neither case, we argue, does performance proceed automatically yet both situations, we suggest, may lead to an inability to recollect performance.",0,1

"This study investigated the relationships of children’s behavioural adjustment, temperamental approach tendencies and empathy to their ability to produce and comprehend one aspect of politeness (namely level of directness) in requests, in a sample of 100 ten-and-a-half-year-old children from the Australian Temperament Project (ATP) population. The study showed that high levels of anxious fearful behaviour problems increased the likelihood of producing less direct requests to more powerful others while high levels of approaching temperament increased the likelihood of producing less direct requests to more distant others. High levels of hostile aggressive behaviour problems increased the likelihood of producing direct requests to more distant others. By comparison high levels of approaching temperament, empathy and social anxiety increased the likelihood of children judging more direct requests to more powerful others to be effective. The findings supported the view that individual differences are related to children’s use of directness in response to variation in the social context of request situations.",0,1

"The distinction between ‘partial’ and ‘total’ interpretations (models) is discussed and related to the distinction between proof-theoretical and model-theoretical treatments of logic. It is claimed that there is a parallel between the construction of a proof based on a set of premises and e.g. the production of a natural-language text which is based on information in some kind of data-base. The main part of the paper is devoted to a discussion of the relations between the deduction rules traditionally associated with the existential quantifier and notions pertaining to the theory of reference such as specificity and referentiality /attributivity. Two types of specificity are distinguished, which can be connected with ‘Existential Elimination’ and ‘Existential Introduction’, respectively. A distinction is further made between trivial and non-trivial ‘Existential Introduction’, where only the latter kind involves erasure of ‘coreference links.’ It is argued that an analogous treatment of the referential-attributive distinction is a way of making sense of Donnellan's suggestion that the latteT may depend on the description's role in an argument. Finally, the notions of 'external anchoring' and ‘stability of individual concepts’ are related to the distinctions made earlier in the paper.",0,1
"This article is a comparative analysis of moving and still‐image documentary produced as part of the factography movement in the USSR. Factography was an interdisciplinary movement (driven in part by contemporary linguistic work) that sought to align with the First Five‐Year Plan by eliminating the opposition between signification and production, transforming the relationship between language and work. I examine Esfir Shub's The Great Way alongside a photo‐essay on “a day in the life” of a Soviet working family in light of the critical responses to them in order to highlight the set of beliefs these practitioners, critics, and audiences held about the meanings these mediums convey. Because these ideas revolved so centrally around concerns about the rootedness and mobility of photographic signs, I turn to models of entextualization and develop a notion of cinematic indexicality as both trace and deixis in order to explicate the media ideologies subtending these positions.

"Abstract Many studies have addressed the effect of neighborhood density (phonological similarity among words) on word learning in quiet listening conditions. We explored how noise influences the effect of neighborhood density on children's word learning. One-hundred-and-two preschoolers learned nonwords varied in neighborhood density in one of four listening conditions: quiet, +15 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), +6 dB SNR, and 0 dB SNR. Results showed that a high-density advantage for children under quiet listening condition was significantly reduced as noise increased. This finding implies an adverse impact of noise on long-term outcomes of word learning.",0,1

"The Algonkin Indian languages are spoken in three areas. The first stretches from Hudson Bay to Cape Hatteras; the second and third, much smaller, lie at the foot of the Rockies in Canada and in the United States respectively. The languages of this family classify into four fundamental groups or branches: Central-Eastern, Cheyenne, Blackfoot, and Arapaho.2 These are so differentiated that their divergence must be old: perhaps a thousand, perhaps even two thousand or more years old. The four branches coincide with the three areas, except that Cheyenne has in the 19th century been spoken in the Arapaho area. The Cheyenne represent a recent drift from Minnesota westward into the habitat of the Arapaho branch in the later 18th century and the first decades of the 19th. Accordingly, history and comparative classification are in accord. Ethnologists, however, have tended to project the Cheyenne westward movement, from an eastern farming to a western nomadic life, to the Arapaho also.3 There is no shred of historic evidence for such a migration by the Arapaho in recent centuries, and the linguistic classification makes it improbable. Yet the erroneous inference dies hard, and persists in the literature. Why? Because it simplifies the picture. It is easier for speculating ethnologists to treat Algonkin as an undifferentiated unit colored green on the map, than to take cognizance of the historically significant classification worked out by comparative Algonkinists.",0,1

"This paper presents findings of a study on audience engagement on Twitter, based on tweets published during two shows of the popular German crime series, Tatort. Most existing research on the use of Twitter by broadcast audiences originates in communication studies and pays little attention to language use. In this paper we approach audience engagement on Twitter as recontextualization of practices of audience talk during television watching and discuss in detail similarities and differences between direct and mediated audience engagement. The data consists of all tweets with the hashtag #tatort that were published during the two shows, amounting to approx. 11,000 messages with 121,000 word-forms. The analysis draws on pragmatic, semantic and formal criteria to distinguish seven types of tweets depending on their orientation to the on-going show. These are tweets that (a) frame the reception experience; (b) offer local (i.e. limited to a particular scene) and (c) global (i.e. referring to a larger chunk of the narrative) commentary; (d) anticipate the development of the narrative; (e) compare aspects of the show to the viewer’s own life-world; (f) ask questions; and (g) engage in parasocial interaction with actors or producers. Each category is discussed and exemplified in terms of typical variants and linguistic means. We also examine how these categories map on to all tweets that refer to a short scene from one show. In conclusion, this paper contributes to Twitter research by proposing a language-focused approach to Twitter-based audience engagement and by categorizing typical communicative activities carried out on Twitter during television watching.",0,1

After laying out the puzzle for five proposed explanations of obsessive thought and then discussing several possible ways that the puzzle might be avoided, I close the article by arguing that we can avoid the puzzle by adopting a new positive view of insight‐directed obsessive thought.",0,1

Clevedon, UK : Multilingual Matters. 145 p., 69,95 $US. Cet ouvrage comprend sept articles portant sur divers aspects du bilinguisme dans des contextes linguistiques variés. Cinq d'entre eux présentent des données nord-américaines : ceux de Valdés, de Toribio, de Hornberger et de Varghese parlent de situations vécues aux États-Unis et celui de Morgan porte sur une recherche menée au Canada. L'article de Creese présente des données européennes et traite d'un aspect du bilinguisme en Angleterre. Quant à Benson, elle se penche sur deux pays en voie de développement, la Bolivie en Amérique du Sud et le Mozambique en Afrique. Il faut souligner que la provenance variée des articles constitue l'une des richesses de ce recueil. Les trois thèmes suivants, autour desquels sont regroupés les articles, sont présentés dans l'introduction (il aurait été profitable que les thèmes soient identifiés par des titres de section au sein du livre afin de guider le lecteur d'un thème à l'autre et de rendre le tout plus convivial) : • définitions du bilinguisme • identités et rôles de l'enseignant bilingue • formation continue chez les enseignants bilingues Le premier thème regroupe trois articles, soit ceux de Valdés, de Toribio et de Hornberger. Valdés établit un lien entre la réussite scolaire [End Page 351] des enfants dont la langue est minoritaire et le type de langue majoritaire qu'ils acquièrent. Elle parle de l'importance pour ces enfants d'acquérir une langue scolaire (academic) plutôt qu'une langue plus familière. Elle montre à quel point il est utile d'avoir une vue d'ensemble des genres et de l'étendue des expériences et des interactions nécessaires pour que des enfants de langue minoritaire puissent atteindre un niveau linguistique qui correspond aux exigences des établissements scolaires. L'article de Toribio porte sur le discours de personnes bilingues (anglais/espagnol). L'auteure offre une analyse linguistique qui illustre le contact entre les langues, les transferts interlinguaux, l'alternance de codes, etc. Elle présente quelques pistes de nature pédagogique. Le troisième article, celui de Hornberger, présente un modèle de double « littératie » (biliteracy) proposé comme outil auprès d'enseignants bilingues. Le deuxième thème regroupe deux articles et porte sur les identités et les rôles de l'enseignant bilingue. L'auteur du premier, Morgan, décrit les interactions qu'il a eues en tant qu'enseignant d'anglais langue seconde auprès d'un groupe d'aînés chinois. Dans cet article, il se révèle à ses étudiants sur des sujets portant sur la culture, le partage des tâches, la famille, etc. Cette ouverture permet d'explorer toute la question des transformations potentielles de l'identité d'un enseignant dans le contexte de l'enseignement d'une langue seconde et de l'enseignement bilingue. Le deuxième article, signé par Creese, porte sur la question du partenariat qui existe entre les professeurs enseignant une matière scolaire et les enseignants d'anglais (English as an additional language) dans les écoles secondaires. L'auteure s'est intéressée en particulier à six enseignants d'anglais bilingues (turc/anglais) et à la transformation de leur rôle au sein de la classe ainsi que de leur utilisation de la langue maternelle et de la langue cible dans l'enseignement d'une matière. Le troisième groupe, composé de deux articles, porte sur la formation d'enseignants bilingues. Dans l'article de Benson, il est question du contexte très particulier que vivent les enseignants de langue seconde dans les pays en voie de développement.

"In a direction-giving task, we examine whether a high-level constraint—the task partners’ relative body alignment—influences spatial language use and task accuracy. In 32 pairs, task partners interacted in two conditions: for one route description, direction givers (DGs) and direction followers (DFs) sat side-by-side (aligned condition), and for another they sat opposite one another (counter-aligned condition). After each description, DFs drew the route on a map. When pairs were counter-aligned (vs. aligned), DGs increased their use of expressions from a survey perspective, using more frequently terms such as east-west. When counter-aligned, DFs also used more words per conversational turn, which was taken to reflect the increased difficulty of coordinating in that condition. Still, in terms of task performance, the accuracy of DFs’ drawings was unaffected by the partners’ body alignment or spatial language use; it was only predicted by the DGs’ spatial ability. We argue that, because direction giving emphasizes accuracy, task partners invest in strategies that contribute to mutual understanding (e.g., recaps of the route by the DF at the end, evidenced by shifts in language use over time). Thus, body alignment in direction giving impacts coordination difficulty and spatial language use, but it does not singularly influence task performance.",0,1

"This article examines Daša Drndić's April in Berlin ( April u Berlinu , 2007), alongside the author’s other Holocaust novels, as literary responses to historical revisionism and outright denialism of the Holocaust in Croatia, which had emerged into the political and cultural mainstream during the War of Independence (1991-1995) and has persisted into the post-war period. Since the historical legacy of the Fascist NDH in Croatia has been de-traumatized, it no longer represents a crisis of historical consciousness, which would entail a confrontation with the violent past as well as a painful transformation of national identity and the political space in which this identity is articulated. In contrast to de-traumatization, as an ethnocentric strategy that normalizes the nation’s fascist crimes, Drndić’s novels stage a shocking confrontation with the shards of the violent past. Through both their innovative graphic layout and interdiscursive textuality—which combines historiographical narration with avant-garde fictional and artistic devices, words with image—Drndić’s novels function as literary archives and monuments, and archives as monuments, intended to disturb, disrupt, and jolt the reader into awareness of traumatic history, laying bare the ideological mechanisms of political control and bringing the bodies of victims to our doorstep.",0,1
"This article examines the acquisition of embedded verb placement in Swedish children, focusing on Neg-V and V-Neg order. It is proposed that a principle of economy of movement creates an overuse of V-Neg order in embedded clauses and that the low frequency of the target-consistent Neg-V order in child-directed speech obstructs children from revising their initial hypothesis about the verb placement in embedded clauses, creating a delay in the acquisition of Neg-V. However, it is also demonstrated that, despite the lack of clear evidence for the Neg-V order in Swedish children's input, the children distinguish between different types of embedded clauses in the acquisition of Neg-V and V-Neg order already between the age of 3 and 4 years, supporting a microparametric approach to language acquisition. Comparing child-directed Swedish and child-directed German, it is further proposed that the presence of clear evidence for verb-final in the input to German children aids error-free acquisition of embedded verb placement in German.",0,1
"This work focuses on explaining both grammatical universals of word order and quantitative word-order preferences in usage by means of a simple efficiency principle: dependency locality.

We give large-scale corpus evidence that dependency locality predicts word order in both grammar and usage, beyond what would be expected from independently motivated principles, and demonstrate a means for dissociating grammar and usage in corpus studies. Finally, we discuss previously undocumented variation in dependency length and how it correlates with other linguistic features such as head direction, providing a rich set of explananda for future linguistic theories.",0,1
"Language is subject to a variety of pressures. Recent work has documented that many aspects of language structure have properties that appear to be shaped by biases for the efficient communication of semantic meaning. Other work has investigated the role of social pressures, whereby linguistic variants can acquire positive or negative evaluation based on who is perceived to be using them. While the influence of these two sets of biases on language change has been well documented, they have typically been treated separately, in distinct lines of research. We used a miniature language paradigm to test how these biases interact in language change. Specifically, we asked whether pressures to mark social meaning can lead linguistic systems to become less efficient at communicating semantic meaning. We exposed participants to a miniature language with uninformative constituent order and two dialects, one that employed case and one that did not. In the instructions, we socially biased participants toward users of the case dialect, users of the no-case dialect, or neither. Learners biased toward the no-case dialect dropped informative case, thus creating a linguistic system with high message uncertainty. They failed to compensate for this increased message uncertainty even after additional exposure to the novel language. Case was retained in all other conditions. These findings suggest that social biases not only interact with biases for efficient communication in language change but also can lead to linguistic systems that are less efficient at communicating semantic meaning.",0,1
"BOOK NOTICES 685 and dialogue begin to develop at one and one half to two years. At about four years, when the child has acquired a basic narrative competence, she enters the narrative stage of cognitive development. At this stage language has started to take over the mind: 'thought is held to be carried out in terms of inner speech . . . thought is formed by the categories and relations found in language, or the genres expressed in discourse . . . [and] language is used to articulate and manipulate thought and knowledge systems' (21). In six separate chapters (Chs. 5-10), N shows that, through their growing linguistic capacities and in collaboration with social others, children are able to construct autobiographic memories, concepts of objects and time, knowledge of categories, and knowledge of intentions of self and others. This book is a well documented and carefully presented critique of strong nativism in developmental psychology and linguistics. N does not view cognition and language as mental faculties unfolding naturally according to a genetically encoded plan but as culturally mediated constructs. At the same time, the role of innate biological factors is not ignored, but the biological imperative to language acquisition is said to be 'of a very general kind that directs the child to attend to patterns of language' (113). For linguists, the main value of the book lies perhaps not in the originality of its view on language acquisition as a process of collaborative construction of culture-specific concepts and categories through which the child becomes a member of a culture and a social group, but more in the convincing way this view is substantiated with a wealth ofinteresting data which no one interested in language acquisition can afford to ignore. [Vincent A. de Rooij, University ofAmsterdam.] Prepositions and complement clauses: A syntactic and semantic study of verbs governing prepositions and complement clauses in present-day English. By Juhani Rudanko. (SUNY series in linguistics ,) Albany: State University of New York Press, 1996. Pp. viii, 211. Paper $19.95. This book studies acategory ofverb complementation that is neglected in grammars and rarely listed in dictionaryentries: acomplementconsistingofapreposition followed by an -ing clause. Ch. 1 is a short introduction , outlining the aims and scope of the book, the theoretical framework it is based on: Noam Chomsky 's principles and parameters theory, the database (the BROWN andLOB corpora), H. Poutsma's grammar (A grammar oflate Modern Englishfor the use ofcontinental,especiallyDutch, students,Groningen: Noordhoff, 1926), as well as his unpublished dictionary and More classes ofverbs in English (ed. by Loraine I. Bridgeman, unpublished linguistics research project, Indiana University, 1965), and the structural layout ofthe book. Chs. 2-8 describe and analyze individual patterns (in in Ch. 2, to in Chs. 3-4, at in Ch. 5, oninCh. 6, with inCh. 7, ofinCh. 8). Ch. 9provides a summary and conclusion. The chapters on individual patterns provide not only lists of verbs, but also detailed semantic analyses which suggest that verbs do not select their complement patterns randomly but according to semantic similarity. Rudanko draws a major distinction between intransitive uses, which are found with all six prepositions, and transitive uses, which are restricted to to, with, and of. The restriction of transitive uses to those three prepositions is, however, unnecessarily narrow, as transitive uses of verbs selecting at followed by a sentential complement seem equally possible : ""Last summer you kept me at painting all day long."" R also addresses the notoriously difficult problem of accounting for variation between subject and object control with the same matrix verb. Two major factors are decisive: animacy, i.e. whether the main clause object is animate or inanimate, and optional transitivity, i.e. according to R the same verb may be used transitively or intransitively, as in ""The management converted the plant to making steel"" (6a) and '""The plant converted to making steel'' (6b). Example 6b requires a modification ofBach's generalization 'in object control structures the object NP must be structurally represented' (Emmon Bach, 'In defense of passive', Linguistics and Philosophy 3.297-341). This is provided by R's distinction between a strong (= the original) form and a weak form, which does allow for intransitive uses ofmatrix verbs in object control...",0,1

"Number words in several Tungag-Nalik languages are morphologically complex. This kind of complexity is not the result of arithmetic operations but has its origin in the sequence of successive Proto-Oceanic number words.

As sequential number word formation is also found in several other Meso-Melanesian languages and non-Austronesian languages of New Ireland and New Britain, it is likely to be an areal feature.",0,1
"In this paper, I analyse the changing rhetorical role of science in UK broadsheet newspapers from 1993 and 2005, and conclude that there have been noteworthy changes. First, science, and more specifically, the formulation the science, is increasingly employed as a model of authority, appealing to ethos rather than logos; the authority is asserted but relatively rarely justified, and this may be considered the most significant change in that it drives several others. At the same time, there has been a popularisation of the science in the newspapers as it becomes an ‘add on’ to popular stories. Furthermore, there is evidence that science is being progressively fitted into the news story format, which demands recency as a news value, as opposed to features-style reports. Finally, science appears to have shifted from its earlier place in opposition to art and culture, to a paradigm in which its primary alter, or opposition, is religion.",0,1
"The primary goal of this paper is to retrace the origins of the phonesthemic {gr-/prehension}, {sm-/oral phenomena} and {sn-/nasality} relations attested in English by words such as grab, grasp and grip, smile, smirk and smooch, and sneeze, sniff and snore respectively, to Proto-Indo-European and beyond. After a discussion of the links between phonesthemes, sound symbolism and arbitrariness, it investigates gr-, sm- and sn- within a psychomechanical approach. The three relations are contextualized by an exploration of their existence in Indo-European languages and, at featural level, in language families other than Indo-European. The second goal of the paper is embedded in the claim that the phonetic characteristics of the ‘core invariants’ in English gr-, sm- and sn- reconstructable for PIE (the tectal <*G(h)> in *G(h)r-, and the nasals <*m> and <*n> in *sm- and *sn- respectively) can be projected back, within the above relations, to the putative conditions of the origins of speech, by adopting a semiogenetic perspective. The framework adopted to do so is STEELS, a neo-Darwinian theory of the emergence and evolution of the linguistic sign which postulates that the initial use of resonances produced by the human vocal tract was both self-referential and vocomimetic.",0,1

However, on the other hand, they are the doctors who are paid at the bottom of the scale.”), those which are unacceptable (“We could go to Jamaica for our vacation this year.

"We report an effort to replicate and extend Levelt and Kelter’s (1982) Experiment 3. In their study, experimenters phoned businesses and asked, At what time does your shop close? or What time does your shop close? Participants were more likely to produce prepositional responses (At 7 o’clock) to questions containing a preposition than to questions that did not. Across three experiments, we replicated Levelt and Kelter’s method, and included a number of other communicative contexts (asking questions by phone, in person, or by text message, and asking people both known and unknown to the experimenter). Our efforts produced mixed results. Across experiments, and within each communicative context, we found the predicted pattern of results (more prepositional responses following prepositional questions). Although this pattern was not statistically reliable in our individual experiments, it was significant in an analysis conducted across all of our experiments. Overall, our results suggest that the structural repetition effect observed by Levelt and Kelter is replicable, but is weaker than the effect reported in the original paper.",0,1

"This paper revisits the debate as to whether n-words such as English nobody, French personne and Italian nessuno are indefinites or intrinsically negative. Intrinsic negative value is diagnozed by use in the three contexts of fragment answers, double negation and constituent negation. Are these criterial contexts involved in a predictable way through the development of future n-words? The question is answered by a detailed study of Polarity Sensitive Items (PSI) that are potentially ambiguous between n-word and negative polarity item (NPI) in four different languages (Finnish, French, American English and Italian). An ordered relation is found from negative fragment answers, that can be evoked by strong NPIs, to double negation and constituent negation, that are communicated by intrinsically negative n-words. Having identified micro-steps into n-word status, the paper demonstrates that n-words are not mere indefinites, and must have an intrinsic negative value.",0,1
"In Chimila, nasal consonants contrast with voiced stops at the same point of articulation and no surface phonetic contrast occurs between nasalized and oral vowels in core lexemes. Nevertheless, several lines of evidence indicate that the Chimila lexicon includes nasal morphemes in contrast with oral morphemes. Evidence for this contrast includes morphophonemic alternations of stem-forming verb suffixes, appearance of a glottal glide following intransitive verb roots that have been transitivized, allomorphs of the intransitive imperative, and a restricted alternation between word-initial voiced stops and nasal consonants in roots and some suffixes. A constraint requiring lexical nasality to attach to consonants in core lexemes and the interaction of this constraint with the prosodic system, lexical tone, syllable structure, and the morphology account for the varied manifestations of lexical nasality.",0,1

"A new type of pole-zero transfer function of the vocal tract is obtained.The results are comparable with the standard two dimensional waveguide model.The new model is more efficient than the standard two dimensional waveguide model.The wall and glottal reflection coefficients are used for tuning of the bandwidths. A vocal tract model based on a digital waveguide is presented in which the vocal tract has been decomposed into a number of convergent and divergent ducts. The divergent duct is modeled by a 2D-featured 1D digital waveguide and the convergent duct by a one dimensional waveguide. The modeling of the divergent duct is based on splitting the volume velocity into axial and radial components. The combination of separate modeling of the divergent and convergent ducts forms the foundation of the current approach. The advantage of this approach is the ability to get a transfer function in zero-pole form that eliminates the need to perform numerical calculations on a discrete 2D mesh. In this way the present model named as a 2D-featured 1D digital waveguide model has been found to be more efficient than the standard 2D waveguide model and in very good comparison with it in the formant frequency patterns of the vowels /a/, /e/, /i/, /o/ and /u/. The model has two control parameters, the wall and glottal reflection coefficients that can be effectively employed for bandwidth tuning. The model also shows its ability to generate smooth dynamic changes in the vocal tract during the transition of vowels.",0,1
"This study examined the role of need for closure and need for cognition in predicting second language (L2) writing-specific psychological factors, namely, self-efficacy, anxiety, motivation, and self-regulation. To do this, we collected self-report data from 186 undergraduate learners of English. Results of path analyses revealed that both need for closure and need for cognition predicted writing self-efficacy, anxiety, motivation, and self-regulation. In addition, mediation analyses showed that different aspects of need for closure predicted the psychological aspects of L2 writing indirectly through need for cognition. The findings highlight that learners’ cognition and their tendency toward information processing and willingness to engage in effortful thinking play an essential role in their perception and emotions toward L2 writing. It is recommended that teachers pay particular attention to learners’ need for cognition, need for closure, and the aforementioned writing-specific psychological factors in L2 writing classrooms.",0,1
"Every language variety embodies a set of culture-specific ways of thinking that can be articulated with maximal clarity and minimal ethnocentrism in the form of ‘cultural scripts’ using natural semantic metalanguage (NSM). In this study, perceptions of ‘personal autonomy’ in Anglo culture and in Singapore culture are explored on the basis of linguistic evidence using NSM. These Anglo and Singaporean attitudes to personal autonomy are articulated in the form of cultural scripts, and are thus compared and contrasted. The proposed cultural scripts show that even though Anglo English speakers and Singapore English speakers can both be said to speak the same ‘language’, the cultural values reflected by the two varieties can be radically different from and even at odds with each other.",0,1
"Abstract Several recent proposals hold that CP complements appear rightmost in many languages as the result of a two‐step leftward‐movement process: first the CP moves leftward, then a remnant phrase carries all other material to the left of that moved position. I show here that the arguments that have been given in favor of this approach do not go through. In contrast, a rightward‐movement analysis explains all the facts in a much simpler and less ad hoc derivation. These facts include (i) a left‐right asymmetry in syntactic category; (ii) binding facts; (iii) preposition stranding; and (iv) extraction. Importantly, binding must depend on precede‐and‐command rather than c‐command (Bruening ) and there is never reconstruction for Binding Condition C. Regarding preposition stranding, the results of a large‐scale survey reveal that there is actually significant speaker variability in whether prepositions can be stranded when CPs move to the right. I spell out a nongrammatical account of this variability within the rightward‐movement analysis. With many of these phenomena, rightward movement of CPs does not pattern with remnant‐VP fronting, as it should in the leftward‐movement analysis.",0,1

"The paper describes the combined results of several projects which constitute a basic language resource infrastructure for printed historical Slovene. The IMP language resources consist of a digital library, an annotated corpus and a lexicon, which are interlinked and uniformly encoded following the Text Encoding Initiative Guidelines. The library holds about 650 units (mostly complete books) consisting of facsimiles with 45,000 pages as well as hand-corrected and structured transcriptions. The hand-annotated corpus has 300,000 tokens, where each word is tagged with its modernised word form, lemma, part-of-speech and, in cases of archaic words, its nearest contemporary equivalents. This information was extracted into the lexicon, which also covers an extended target-annotated corpus, resulting in 20,000 lemmas (of these 4,000 archaic) with 50,000 modern word forms and 70,000 attested forms. We have also developed a program to modernise, tag and lemmatise historical Slovene, and annotated the digital library with it, producing an automatically annotated corpus of 15 million words. To serve the humanities, the digital library and lexicon are available for reading and browsing on the web and the corpora via a concordancer. For language technology research and development the resources are available in source TEI XML under the Creative Commons Attribution licence.

"Abstract At the dawn of anthropology, gesture was widely considered a “universal language”. In the 20th century, however, this framing fell out of favor as anthropologists rejected universalism in favor of relativism. These polemical positions were largely fueled by high-flying rhetoric and second-hand report; researchers had neither the data nor the conceptual frameworks to stake out substantive positions. Today we have much more data, but our frameworks remain underdeveloped and often implicit. Here, I outline several emerging conceptual tools that help us make sense of universals and diversity in gesture. I then sketch the state of our knowledge about a handful of gestural phenomena, further developing these conceptual tools on the way. This brief survey underscores a clear conclusion: gesture is unmistakably similar around the world while also being broadly diverse. Our task ahead is to put polemics aside and explore this duality systematically – and soon, before gestural diversity dwindles further.",0,1
"This paper examines the syntax and semantics of negation across Salish. Three widespread and one geographically restricted pattern are distinguished across the family. Two of the widespread patterns (A and B), as well as the restricted pattern (B′), involve a negative predicate selecting for a clausal complement. In pattern A, the negated clause is nominalized: I analyze this as a case of negative existential quantification over minimal situations. In Patterns B and B′, the negated clause takes conjunctive (i.e., subjunctive) morphology: I analyze these patterns as cases of simple (propositional) negation. The development of monoclausal (Pattern C) negation is then examined in several branches of the family. The paper concludes with some remarks about the typological and theoretical status of the various Salish negation patterns.",0,1

"This study aims to investigate adult L2 speakers’ use of different types of information in the comprehension of pragmatic inferences by examining L1-Mandarin Chinese L2-English speakers’ sensitivity to cues all and any in scalar implicature (SI) computation for some. This article and our experimental setup does not seek to understand how the question under discussion (QUD) affects implicature derivation. Rather, we examine whether comprehension of scalar sentences is modulated by QUD. We used an acceptability judgment task in which the felicitousness of the target response containing some in a given picture is manipulated by the QUD containing all or any. The interpretation of some depends on the QUD. For instance, in the question “Are all/any of the squares red?,” all primes an implicature “Some but not all squares are red” reading, whereas any does not. Linear mixed-effects regression analysis conducted on z-score transformed Likert-scale ratings with QUD type (all/any) and Group (native vs. L2 speakers) showed that native speakers differentiated between any and all in their ratings for target sentences with some, but L2 speakers did not. That is, native speakers rated target infelicitous sentences with some in the QUD-any condition significantly higher than in the QUD-all condition. Though we stress that these results must be considered exploratory in nature, our findings are in line with the proposal that native and L2 speakers differ in the type of information they attend to during language comprehension.",0,1
"This paper reports the results of an exploratory semantic analysis of Croatian suffixations in -stv(o).

Our aim is to identify the suffix's most type-frequent and productive meanings as well as typical patterns of polysemy in -stv(o) derivatives and their main motivating mechanisms. Assuming a usage-based Cognitive Grammar stance and Barcelona's (2011) gradient view of metonymy, we examine an extensive corpus of suffixations and propose low-level generalizations, i.e., symbolic schemas that are shown to be variably frequent and productive. Although no single superschema can capture the extreme semantic variability of -stv(o) derivatives, we identify various local patterns of polysemy, which are predominantly motivated by metonymy.",0,1

For the Afrikaans lexicographer with his unique frame of reference and cultural and social value judgements, it becomes clear only in a Dutch milieu why the lexicographical editing of Dutch lemmata in a Dutch-Afrikaans translation dictionary is such a big challenge, despite the fact that the two languages are so closely related. Language interference and influence occur more readily between closely related languages.

Case studyGrammar learning is an important part of formal second language learning. Effective grammar learning should be communicative, i.e. develop language learners’ ability to use grammar fluently, appropriately and flexibly in communication. The article looks for an answer to the questions: which grammar teaching techniques are used in the Estonian as a second language class in basic school and to what extent they correspond to the modern principles of communicative grammar teaching.In order to get answers, a case study has been conducted in the Estonian as a second language classes of the eighth and seventh grade study groups (n = 16) of a large school. The class observations were carried out by one of the authors of the article, who was a student at the University of Tartu at the time of the observations, on the assumption that the student’s presence in the class has the least impact on both the teacher and the students. Observations took place in four different teachers’ 45-minute classes with an average of 15 students. The observed lessons were randomly selected from the lesson plan according to times suitable for the observer and in agreement with the teacher conducting the lesson.Of the observed lessons, four were fully devoted to grammar teaching and three were partially devoted to grammar teaching. Lessons were analyzed with directed content analysis based on categories derived from the theory. The results showed that a little over a third of the total time of the observed lessons was spent on grammar. More time was spent explaining grammar than practicing. The explanations were mostly deductive, the students themselves made few discoveries about the language. Practice mostly consisted of written contextfree and artificial tasks. Grammar learning was little related to the general topics, life and sub-skills being studied. In the case of all grammatical phenomena to be studied, the focus was on their forms and, in some classes, to some extent also on their meaning. The usage function was somewhat dealt with in just one lesson. Students could not practice using the learned grammar in active natural communication in unprepared improvisational situations. There were few tasks that corresponded to the interests of basic school students. The language phenomena being studied seemed mostly affordable to the students, but the fact that students almost did not use them in communication makes it difficult to assess the actual affordability of the topics.In summary, the grammar study of the eighth and seventh grades of the school under consideration was very traditional in the lessons of Estonian as a second language, and there were very few elements of communicative grammar study. In this way, students cannot have a real sense of the meaning and usage function of the grammatical phenomena they are learning. Also, the automaticity for using grammar does not develop, and students are not able to use the grammar topics they learn fluently, situationally and flexibly in real communication. If the learning is not interesting, then the students are not absorbed in the learning, which has a negative effect on learning motivation and which reduces the effectiveness of learning.The research results cannot be generalized to Estonian as a second language classes in all basic schools in Estonia.

Most of this irregularity is undoubtedly due to language contact; I argue, however, that an oversimplified view of the processes at work has prevailed in the literature on West Iranian dialectology, with specialists assuming that deviations from an expected outcome in a given non‐Persian language are due to lexical borrowing from some chronological stage of Persian. It is demonstrated that this qualitative approach yields at times problematic conclusions stemming from the lack of explicit probabilistic inferences regarding the distribution of the data: Persian may not be the sole donor language; additionally, borrowing at the lexical level is not always the mechanism that introduces irregularity. In many cases, the possibility that West Iranian languages show different reflexes in different conditioning environments remains under‐explored. I employ a novel Bayesian approach designed to overcome these problems and tease apart the different determinants of irregularity in patterns of West Iranian sound change. This methodology helps to provisionally resolve a number of outstanding questions in the literature on West Iranian dialectology concerning the dialectal affiliation of certain sound changes. I outline future directions for work of this sort.",0,1
"Multilingual identity is an area ripe for further exploration within the existing extensive body of identity research. In this paper we make a case for a conceptual framework that defines multilingual identity formation in terms of learners’ active involvement, and proposes the classroom as the hitherto underused site for participative identity (re)negotiation. After reviewing three key theoretical perspectives on identity (the psychosocial, sociocultural and poststructural) for points of intersection and difference, we propose a new framework for a multi-theoretical approach to the conceptualisation and investigation of multilingual identity. This places it at the nexus of (a) individual psychological development, (b), the relational and social, and (c) the historical and contextual. Arguing that a participative perspective can take the field forward, we present a theorised model for classroom practice that provides a structure within which individual learners of a foreign language might explore, with reference to a range of sociolinguistic knowledge, the extent of their current linguistic repertoire. In addition, they are asked to explicitly consider their identity and identifications and offered the agency to (re)negotiate these in terms of multilingual identity, the development of which may be important for investment in language learning.",0,1
"Heutzutage ist es ein allgemein verbreiteter Brauch in der historischen Sprachwissenschaft, dass diachrone Ergebnisse aus der synchronen Untersuchung der früheren Entwicklungsperioden der Sprache gezogen werden, um die Ursachen der linguistischen Veränderungen schlechterdings aufzudecken. Diese Arbeit versucht die Ursachen und den Prozess von morphophonologischen und morphosyntaktischen Veränderungen in der ungarischen Sprache sichtbar zu machen, die aus den inneren sprachlichen Zusammenhängen der mittel- und neuungarischen Perioden stammen und sich aus ihnen erklären lassen. Die untersuchten diachronen Erscheinungen gehören zu verschiedenen Änderungstypen. Sie können repräsentieren: 1. Systemzwang (wie im Falle des paradigmatischen Ausgleiches des Stammes ido ‘Zeit’); 2. Trennung von Form und Funktion (wie z.B. die diachrone Verbindung des Verbalpräfixes át- und der Postposition által ‘durch’) und 3. Wechselentwicklung der grammatischen Synonyme (wie z.B. Alternation der temporalen Bestimmungen mindéltig ~ mindig ‘immer’). Die Ursachen dieser Änderungen stammen aus dem synchronen System der gegebenen Periode und deuten daraufhin, dass allgemeine morphologische, semantische und funktionale Einflüsse ihres synchronen Verbindungssystems ihre historischen Veränderungen determinieren.",0,1

A normative investigation of the speaking fundamental frequency (SFF) and physical size characteristics was carried out on a population of 157 U.S. males. They were found to be somewhat larger than other similar groups. Their mean SFF level was: (1) somewhat lower than those reported for groups studied 25–30 years ago; (2) somewhat higher than those for contemporary groups; and (3) lower than that for a similar group of Polish students.,0,1
"Until at least the end of adolescence, children articulate speech differently than adults. While this discrepancy is often attributed to the maturation of the speech motor system, we sought to demonstrate that the development of spoken language fluency is shaped by complex interactions across motor and cognitive domains. In this study, we specifically tested for a relationship between reading proficiency and coarticulatory organization, a fundamental correlate of spoken language fluency, used for both reading aloud and conversational speech. We conducted reading assessments and ultrasound-based kinematic measurements of intersegmental coarticulation in a group of 32 German children. In German, a language which supports rather consistent grapheme-to-phoneme relationships, reading aloud uses similar phoneme to speech motor gesture correspondences as well as coarticulatory mechanisms as conversational speech. Using general additive modeling we found that better readers exhibited lower degrees of intersegmental coarticulation than poorer readers. This study therefore provides evidence that reading proficiency interacts with coarticulatory patterns in beginning readers. It suggests that in addition to maturational factors, interactions between speech motor ability and other co-developing skills must be considered to fully account for spoken language fluency.",0,1
"A systematic collection of problems and counterexamples is presented for predictions of patterns of relational marking on noun phrases in terms of a noun phrase hierarchy (also known as animacy hierarchy), as conceived of by Silverstein (1976) and others. In seeking to account for case marking distributions that are at odds with the three main principles underlying the noun phrase hierarchy – role expectation, marking economy, scalar continuity –, the ordering of 1st and 2nd person pronouns on top of the hierarchy is given particular attention. Several ways of liberalizing noun phrase rankings in terms of feature systems, in particular an equal ranking for speech-act participants, are considered in order to square hierarchy predictions with the attested diversity of pronominal case marking in split alignment systems.",0,1

"In her influential paper on stance, alignment, and affiliation in conversational storytelling, Tanya Stivers argued that two basic conversational means of receiving a story, nods and vocal continuers, differ in their function: whereas vocal continuers display alignment with the telling activity, nods, during the mid-telling, convey affiliation with the storytellers’ affective stance. In this paper, we elaborate these insights on the basis of a quantitative study informed by conversation analysis. Using a database of 317 stories told in Finnish, we analyzed how story recipients’ nods and continuers in different phases of storytelling (before and after the story climax) predict naïve raters’ judgments of the story recipients’ empathy toward the storyteller. We found that vocal continuers accounted for the perception of empathy during mid-telling, whereas the effect of nods remained weak. The study offers further support to the notion of structural organization of storytelling, and suggests that the significance of vocal continuers as a vehicle of empathy may be greater than has been generally thought of.",0,1
"An HMM-based single character recovery (SCR) model is proposed in this paper to extract a large set of atomic abbreviations and their full forms from a text corpus. By an “atomic abbreviation,” it refers to an abbreviated word consisting of a single Chinese character. This task is important since Chinese abbreviations cannot be enumerated exhaustively but the abbreviation process for compound words seems to be compositional. One can often decode an abbreviated word character by character to its full form. With a large atomic abbreviation dictionary, one may be able to handle multiple character abbreviation problems more easily based on the compositional property of abbreviations.",0,1
"Reciprocal sentences require distributivity for the correct interpretation. In the semantic literature on reciprocals, it is standard to assume that distributivity spans almost everything in reciprocal clauses, including not only reciprocals but also predicates and their arguments. In contrast to this tradition, I argue that nothing but reciprocals themselves should be interpreted distributively. Such a semantics of reciprocal clauses can be accommodated in dynamic frameworks which can store and retrieve dependencies between pluralities, modeled as plural information states, i.e., sets of variable assignments (van den Berg 1996; Nouwen 2003; Brasoveanu 2007; among others). I argue that a reciprocal distributes over nothing else but a plural information state, and I provide compositional interpretation of reciprocity using Plural Compositional Discourse Representation Theory (the extension of Compositional Discourse Representation Theory of Muskens 1996 by Brasoveanu 2007, 2008).",0,1
"Musicological texts about classical music frequently include detailed technical discussions concerning the works being analysed. These references can be specific (e.g. C sharp in the treble clef) or general (fugal passage, Thor’s Hammer). Experts can usually identify the features in question in music scores but a means of performing this task automatically could be very useful for experts and beginners alike. Following work on textual question answering over many years as co-organisers of the QA tasks at the Cross Language Evaluation Forum, we decided in 2013 to propose a new type of task where the input would be a natural language phrase, together with a music score in MusicXML, and the required output would be one or more matching passages in the score. We report here on 3 years of the C@merata task at MediaEval. We describe the design of the task, the evaluation methods we devised for it, the approaches adopted by participant systems and the results obtained. Finally, we assess the progress which has been made in aligning natural language text with music and map out the main steps for the future. The novel aspects of this work are: (1) the task itself, linking musical references to actual music scores, (2) the evaluation methods we devised, based on modified versions of precision and recall, applied to demarcated musical passages, and (3) the progress which has been made in analysing and interpreting detailed technical references to music within texts.",0,1
"This issue brings together a collection of essays on the most prevalent approaches to the analysis of linguistic practices in institutional contexts in the light of the social and communicative changes that have taken place in late modernity. The articles explore institutional discourse in public and private institutions with special attention to the provision of services in relatively new and developing multicultural contexts. From their different analytic perspectives and institutional environments, the analyses illustrate how communicative practices have been modified in order to adapt to the new ways in which capitals, production, management, the markets, the labour force, information and technology are organised in this global era via flows which cut across national borders.",0,1
"As a contribution toward enriching the scholarly interest in the full spectrum of Iberian jazz, this article explores the life, work, and international reception of Catalan pianist Tete Montoliu (1933-1997) within a cultural studies framework. First and foremost, it offers a correction for a tradition of American jazz historiography that in the words of E. Taylor Atkins “has consistently failed to look overseas for jams of consequence” (xii). Moreover, to explore Tete’s accomplishments is to correct for certain tendencies within the existing scholarship on jazz in Spain. As Arribas Garcia highlights, the fact that jazz research has paid more attention to the 1960s and 1980s than the 1970s — the latter being the decade of Spain’s Transition from a dictatorial regime to a constitutional monarchy — is a natural impediment to learning more about the jazz pianist, who recorded over twenty albums during that decade alone. His strong Catalan identity and his connection with the city of Barcelona also distinguish his music from what might be called “Spanish” jazz. Finally, this article also contributes to the need, consistent with the disability studies framework outlined by Neil Lerner and Joseph N. Straus in Sounding Off: Theorizing Disability in Music (2006), to acknowledge that disability is everywhere in music.",0,1
"Most research in psycholinguistics relies on online measures such as reading time to inform and test theories of language comprehension. However, the value of offline measures such as question-answering performance is sometimes overlooked in sentence processing work. Consequently, psycholinguists do not yet understand how the tasks and measures used in online experiments might reflect the content of the representations that are formed by the subject and how our comprehension tasks might influence subjects’ reading strategies. We begin this review by briefly discussing evidence that comprehenders often misinterpret language. We then consider some of the reasons why psycholinguists tend not to use offline measures of comprehension to evaluate competing theories of sentence processing and discuss the role of subject engagement and motivation. Finally, we explore what is currently known about the relationships among task, depth of comprehension, and reading measures.",0,1
"This present study investigated the Chinese vocabulary learning strategies of adolescent learners of Mandarin at two heritage language (HL) schools in Korea. A total of 450 participants from two secondary schools completed the Vocabulary Learning Strategy Inventory (VLSI). The quantitative analysis of the questionnaires was conducted through exploratory factor analysis and multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) in order to explore the Chinese vocabulary learning strategies and learner variables. The results found that ethnicity made no statistical differences in the four VLSI factors, but students’ gender, home language use, Chinese proficiency, and nationality caused statistical differences in vocabulary learning strategies. This study can contribute to re-developing the VLSI for traditional character learning and the Sinographosphere context. The findings shed light on how individual learner differences relate to Chinese vocabulary learning strategies, which yields pedagogical implications.",0,1
"Abstract Kaluza’s law is a proposed restriction in the metre of Beowulf against the resolution of light‐heavy sequences: words like cyning ‘king’ can only resolve and count as the equivalent of a single heavy syllable under more restricted circumstances than can words such as wudu ‘wood’. There has been debate about how to define these ‘restricted circumstances’, with many investigators claiming that this limitation holds only under ‘secondary stress’ (sometimes broadened to include subordinated stress in general). This article reviews the operation of Kaluza’s law in Beowulf , arguing that the correct conditioning is the position immediately following a heavy syllable. The level of stress carried by the (non‐)resolving sequence is irrelevant. A phonological explanation for this restriction may be that the resolution ideally produces bimoraic (light‐light) units; accordingly, resolution of light‐heavy sequences, which is anomalous from a typological and phonological perspective, is only permitted in word‐initial position, or in metrical equivalents.",0,1

"Drone warfare disrupts the generally understood experience of war, and drone operators’ distance from the battlefield has called into question the authenticity of their experiences as participants in conflict. This article examines the autobiographies of three US military drone operators, analysing how the narration is discursively oriented to particular spatial and ideological perspectives. It argues that the linguistic construction of point of view in each text reflects a dynamic and sometimes paradoxical relationship between drone operators and their distance from the battlefield. Observing the position and shifting of deictic centres, the analysis draws parallels between spatial perspective, ideology, and the social identities of drone operators and victims of drone strikes. It concludes by reflecting on the variety of discursive strategies employed across these texts, and considers this variation itself to be an emerging trend in the discourse of drone warfare.",0,1
"The paper examines the way in which the latest linguistic typology (Talmy 1985) can be used in the analysis of witness testimonies in multilingual court cases. Original transcripts of witness testimonies in Spanish and their translations in English by certified court interpreters have been used in this study. The two languages stand at the respective ends of the typological cline based on the lexicalization of the experiential domain in focus here, which is that of motion events. Spanish pattern involves directional verbs in motion expressions and scarce reference to manner, whereas the English pattern “favours” detailed reference to the manner of motion due to the abundance of manner verbs and constructions. Descriptions of motion events in Spanish have significantly fewer types and tokens of manner verbs compared to those of directional verbs, indicating that information on manner is frequently omitted. The English pattern, with pronounced presence of the Manner component in lexicalization, induces interpreters to add information about manner of motion in their translations, affecting the content of the testimonies. Other issues discussed in this paper include agentivity in constructions and their translations, the departure from the habitual pattern in Spanish on certain occasions, and the narrative style of witness testimonies reflecting respective lexicalization patterns of the two languages. The conclusion is that this kind of applied, interdisciplinary research can raise awareness about the role language plays beyond the text itself, and by doing so, bring about improvements and better understanding in the process of witness questioning and translation of witness testimonies.",0,1
"We describe a method for the computer entry of Chinese characters using speech recognition with no vocabulary restrictions. The method exploits the fact that spoken Chinese has only about 400 syllables, and the syllable structure is extremely simple: either consonant/vowel group or vowel group alone. To each of the 23 consonants and 35 vowel groups that comprise a syllable, a code word, or Chinese phonetic alphabet representation (CPAR), is associated. All Chinese characters can be ""spelled-out"" using the 58 highly discriminable CPARs, thus allowing accurate transcription by means of current speech recognition technology.The CPAR system and the speech input method were tested with a discrete word speech recognizer in an experiment with four human subjects. On average, a subject could learn the method with 22 hours of training over a period of 1 or 2 weeks. Subjects were able to translate vocally about 40 characters of Chinese text into CPARs per minute with an accuracy in excess of 97%. This compares roughly to 31 English words per minute. The speech recognition system used was not fast enough to accommodate this rate of speaking, and in actual practice only 24 syllables, or the equivalent of 19 English words, per minute could be entered. Recently developed discrete speech recognition systems can now handle the higher rate; however, such equipment was not available at the time of the experiments reported here.",0,1

"Abstract The function of focus is to activate a set of alternatives, providing the locus for focus‐sensitive particles like only . In the past decade, psycholinguistic research has shown that listeners entertain a set of alternatives in online language comprehension, similar to the algorithm stipulated by Alternative Semantics. The purpose of the present review is to gain a comprehensive picture of the role of focus alternatives in utterance comprehension and interpretation. Specifically, we focus on how the processing of focus particles interacts with alternatives activated by focus. We show that focus marking activates a network of related concepts, but over time, only those that can be considered as focus alternatives in the relevant context of the utterance are retained in the mental representation of the discourse. Focus particles, in turn, increase the competition between the focused element and its alternatives during the initial stages of comprehension, helping contextual restriction of the set of alternatives. Overall, the studies presented in this review show that focus does not only guide a listener in determining which alternatives are relevant for the purpose of conversation, it also plays a fundamental role in the memory representation of a discourse.",0,1

Findings highlight micro-, meso-, and macrolevel influences that constrained ISTs’ adoption of translanguaging and the productive ways they imagined addressing these limitations. Included are implications for how teacher education might support teachers in adopting a translanguaging stance.",0,1

"Abstract The article deals with the problem of correctness in language. Modern linguistic research shows that the dichotomy correct‐incorrect is insufficient to describe acceptability in language. One can establish five degrees of correctness ranging from acceptable, divided, ill‐established, dubious, to unacceptable usage. A mathematical model is developed for the five categories, while a generalised concept of probability, the real interval [0, 1] is replaced by a subset of a finite field, serves as the cardinal tool. Apart from standard statistical packages, computer algebra systems and systems for programming in logic provide appropriate computational means. This model is applied to Mittins’ set of data. It can be proved that in matters of correctness a tendency towards the statistical norm in language is inevitable.",0,1
"Research on input processing in the acquisition of a non-primary language has rested largely on the assumption that learners use a meaning-based approach as the ‘default’ when processing input (VanPatten, 1996). The study reported here poses a challenge to this assumption: findings show that participants who were absolute beginners used a primarily form-based approach when processing Norwegian, a language they had not been exposed to previously. We argue that when positing principles of input processing, there is a need to differentiate between learners who have and who have not developed intermediate grammars of the target language, and that input which is linguistically incomprehensible, as well as devoid of extralinguistic clues, induces form-based processing. The paper concludes with two hypotheses: (1) learners who have acquired some knowledge of the target language will adopt a meaning-based approach to input processing; and (2) learners who have no existing knowledge of the target language will adopt a form-based approach.",0,1
"1. The examination of any map of linguistic distributions for an extended area will show some regions of great diversity (e.g. New Guinea, the Nuba Hills in the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan) and others of relative uniformity (e.g. the aboriginal Eastern Woodlands area of North America, the contemporary United States), while still others seem to be intermediate between these extremes. The problem considered here is that of developing quantitative measures of this diversity in order to render such impressions more objective, allow the comparing of disparate geographical areas, and eventually to correlate varying degrees of linguistic diversity with political, economic, geographic, historic, and other nonlinguistic factors.",0,1

"In this paper we present a pipeline for the detection of spelling variants, i.e., different spellings that represent the same word, in non-standard texts. For example, in Middle Low German texts in and ihn (among others) are potential spellings of a single word, the personal pronoun ‘him’. Spelling variation is usually addressed by normalization, in which non-standard variants are mapped to a corresponding standard variant, e.g. the Modern German word ihn in the case of in. However, the approach to spelling variant detection presented here does not need such a reference to a standard variant and can therefore be applied to data for which a standard variant is missing. The pipeline we present first generates spelling variants for a given word using rewrite rules and surface similarity. Afterwards, the generated types are filtered. We present a new filter that works on the token level, i.e., taking the context of a word into account. Through this mechanism ambiguities on the type level can be resolved. For instance, the Middle Low German word in can not only be the personal pronoun ‘him’, but also the preposition ‘in’, and each of these has different variants. The detected spelling variants can be used in two settings for Digital Humanities research: On the one hand, they can be used to facilitate searching in non-standard texts. On the other hand, they can be used to improve the performance of natural language processing tools on the data by reducing the number of unknown words. To evaluate the utility of the pipeline in both applications, we present two evaluation settings and evaluate the pipeline on Middle Low German texts. We were able to improve the F1 score compared with previous work from $$0.39$$ to $$0.52$$ for the search setting and from $$0.23$$ to $$0.30$$ when detecting spelling variants of unknown words.",0,1

"Reviews1 25 The Dictionary ofAmerican Regional English, Volume HI, I-O. Frederic G. Cassidy (chief editor), Joan Houston Hall (associate editor). Cambridge , MA, and London, England: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press. 1996. Pp. xv + 927. $78.00 (cloth). Introduction and overview Certainly, the arrival of the newest member of the Dictionary ofAmerican RegionalEnglish family has not gone unheralded since Volume III, I-O, appeared on the scene in 1996. However, given the scope and quality of this volume and its predecessors, additional praise is warranted. I for one was especially pleased to hear of the publication of Volume III: At last I would have a chance to look up a puzzling regional term whose distribution and definition had long eluded me: mosquito hawk. I grew up on the Delmarva Peninsula, where my father, born in upper Delaware, introduced me to the term gallinipper , used to refer to the crane fly, an insect that looks like a large mosquito. When I started school, I was surprised to learn that the other children called the same insect a mosquito hawk, or one of its variant forms, skeeter hawk or skeeter eater. However, I gradually became accustomed to the new word, and it became part of my vocabulary. Imagine my surprise when I began studying American English dialects and was introduced to the DARE map showing variants of mosquito hawk (e.g., Volume I, xxvii), not as a term for 'crane fly', but for 'dragonfly'! Further, once I began teaching, mosquito hawk always generated controversy, and sometimes, quite heated debate. Some students, mostly from North Carolina, were convinced that mosquito hawk meant 'dragonfly', while others remained as sharply committed as I was to the 'crane fly' definition. So I eagerly cracked open my copy of DARE III to review the evidence for myself, at last. Surely there had to be pockets of speakers on Delmarva and in North Carolina who used mosquito hawk for 'crane fly', and surely 'crane fly' would emerge as the most common (hence, ""right"") definition! Sadly, my hopes were dashed. The 'dragonfly' definition won primacy of place: it's listed as sense 2.a, 'any of several insects', while 'crane fly' is sense 2.b. Further, the evidence from quotations in which the form appears, and from participants in the DARE survey, a nationwide survey of dialect words conducted in 1965-70, suggests that, even in the Delmarva area, the 'dragonfly' definition wins out. For example, evidence indicates that mosquito hawk means 'dragonfly' in the Chesapeake Bay area (Nixon 1946, 30), while Kurath's 1949 Word Geography states that mosquito hawk for 'dragonfly' is ""the usual expression in all of Delmarvia [sic] and the Virginia Tidewater, in the southeastern half of North Carolina, and in the greater part of South Carolina "" (qtd. in DARE III, 664). In addition, while the 'crane fly' definition is found in such widely scattered areas as central western Wisconsin, California, Massachusetts, and Florida, there are only two mentions in Virginia — about as close as I could come to the Delmarva Peninsula. Alas, then, my initial foray 126Reviews into DARE III did not yield quite the results I had hoped. My only hope now is that as new dialect survey data are gathered, the 'crane fly' definition will be shown to have gained currency on Delmarva and in North Carolina and will one day emerge as Sense l.a. Despite my disappointment over the failure of the evidence to support my beliefs, I am by no means disappointed in DARE III, any more than I am in the first two volumes. In fact, my experience with mosquito hawk illustrates what a wonderful reference tool DARE is: entries consist not only of terms and definitions but of lists of sources in which the terms, in their various senses, are attested. Responses to DARE survey questions are included as well and can be traced back to the exact question that elicited the response. In addition, each individually listed informant can be identified in terms of regional and social characteristics (though we will have to wait for Volume VI for a list of all responses to all questions). Hence, researchers and other interested readers are able...",0,1

"The human ability to anticipate upcoming behavior not only enables smooth turn transitions but also makes early responses possible, as respondents use a variety of cues that provide for early projection of the type of action that is being performed. This article examines resources for projection in interaction in three unrelated languages—Finnish, Japanese, and Mandarin—in sequences where speakers make evaluative assertions on a topic. The focus is on independently agreeing responses initiated in early overlap. Our cross-linguistic analysis reveals that while projection based on the ongoing turn-constructional unit relies on language-specific grammatical constructions, projection based on the larger context seems to be less language-dependent. A crucial finding is that in the target sequences, stances taken toward the topic already during earlier talk, as well as other structural patterns, are among the resources that recipients use for projecting how and when the ongoing turn will end.",0,1

"This paper proposes a blind source separation (BSS) method for recovering multiple speech sources from sound fields recorded by a B-format microphone. This microphone provides a four channel representation that can be used to derive the direction of arrival (DOA) of spatially distinct time-frequency (TF) components. Such sparse components correspond to bins where only one speech source is active and are identified based on the inter-correlation among the mixture signals. They are recovered via a degenerate unmixing estimation technique (DUET)-like method. Proposed is a “local-zone stationarity” assumption, where the amplitude of a speech signal remains approximately constant within a small band of TF components. This assumption is validated through statistical analysis of a quantitative measure of stationarity. Under this assumption, the non-sparse components (TF points where more than one speech source is active) are recovered via a Wiener-filter-like approach where the separated sparse components is utilized as a guide. The final separated sources are obtained by combining the separated sparse and non-sparse components. Both objective and subjective evaluations show that the proposed method achieves better separation quality compared to some existing BSS approaches where up to six simultaneous speech sources are considered.",0,1

"Abstract In this article, I attempt to describe how language is reified, using the call center as an extended example. I take up recent debates regarding language and economic value, attempting to disentangle a by now substantial series of arguments about language and commodification. The theoretical core of the paper is drawn from the work of Georg Lukacs, who provided the account of reification that was at the root of twentieth century critical theory. Following Lukacs, I argue that what is indispensable in the process of reification is both a “contemplative stance” in relation to economic laws and the presence of “special partial systems” within the production process of commodities. These are particularly important considerations for what I refer to as the one-sided rationalization of language that occurs in call centers in particular, but also on a more widespread social basis.",0,1
"Recent research in motion event typology has moved beyond the binary Talmian division of “verb-framed” and “satellite-framed” languages and has established the existence of at least four distinct typological clusters, instantiated by, for example, Swedish (Germanic), French (Romance), Thai (Tai-Kadai) and Telugu (Dravidian). In this paper, we focus on characteristic features of Telugu, as a representative of the fourth cluster. In the study, 30 native Telugu speakers described video-recorded translocative events, in which the factors boundedness, viewpoint and causation were manipulated. Using the model Holistic Spatial Semantics, we show that Telugu speakers (a) preferentially used Direction verbs rather than Path verbs, (b) predominantly used case markers rather than verbs for encoding Path, (c) extensively used Landmark and Region expressions, and (d) frequently used Manner verbs in situations of “boundary-crossing” unlike speakers of typical “verb-framed” languages. We propose these features to be criterial of the fourth typological cluster mentioned above, a claim to be investigated in future research.",0,1

"La thematique erotique chez le clezio se manifeste principalement sous la forme anecdotique. La diversite problematique des facettes semantiques de l'evenement sexuel ou sensuel temoigne une representativite culturelle construite selon la vision de l'ecrivain, avec une evolution chronologique vers l'harmonie comme dominante. Sa frequence reguliere apparente l'evenement erotique a un rite tant humain que narratif, les sequences fonctionnant comme propositions narratives de rang variable. La macrostructure met ainsi en place un horizon d'attente excitant, et l'ensemble des determinations expressives jouant sur l'implicite, la connotation et le mimetisme syntaxique, qui fondent la plupart des segments erotiques, est a l'origine du possible ressentiment erotique a la lecture. L'erotisaion du texte repose donc sur une mise en texte particuliere du referent, ou le vecu de l'evenement est l'objet meme du discours. La litterarite de la representation est garantie par cette reflexivite et par la notion d'acte textuel au sens d'effet en general et de contre-marquage en particulier. Le meme marquage stytematique preside a la mise en texte de referents non erotiques, par quoi l'erotisation irradie au niveau de la litterarite singuliere : la notion d'erotisme s'elargit a la participation sensorielle au monde. La textualite descriptive participe de l'erotisation de la litterarite generique en vertu de ses structurations propres, ainsi que d'une tendance a la narrativisation qui opere une osmose entre les types de textes.

"1. The most distinctive feature of the verbal system of a Slavic language is undoubtedly its verbal aspect. Stated simply, a particular Slavic verb has either perfective (P) aspect, which mean that a commitment as to completion has been added to the verb's basic meaning, or it has imperfective (I) aspect, in which is no such implication.' To express the meaning 'to write' in Russian, a choice has to be made between the two aspectual partners pisat' I 'to write, to be in the process of writing' and napisat' P to write, to get written, to complete the writing (of)'. There are also morphological implications to aspect, in that in certain constructs the selection of a verb form of a particular aspect is obligatory; for example, the periphrastic future of Russian permits only the use of an I verb, as in ja budu pisat' 'I will write, I will be writing' (*ja budu napisat' does not occur). Exceptions to this typical aspectual pairing, such as Russian obescat' 'to promise', which functions as either an I or a P verb, testify by their very oddity to the pervasiveness of the aspectual dichotomy.2 In the last hundred years, the Slavic languages have generated many verbs which have, for the most part, loan elements for their base, e.g. Russian patentovat' 'to patent'. A striking characteristic of these new verbs is that very many of them operate outside or only partially inside the traditional aspect system. Patentovat' is both I and P: it has two aspects-or, stated in another way, it has no aspect. I propose to examine this blurring or elimination of aspectual distinctions in the Slavic languages by considering the status of new verbs in two languages, Russian of the East Slavic group and Serbo-Croatian of the South Slavic group.",0,1
"Abstract The present research explicates how job applicants employ language abstraction to present themselves as a good or bad candidate. According to the LIB theory (Maass, Salvi, Arcuri, &amp; Semin, 1989), we tested the hypothesis that, with positive instruction (i.e., to be recruited), participants’ responses would be more abstract with positive items and more concrete with negative items. Conversely, we expected that participants’ responses would be more concrete with positive items and more abstract with negative ones when the instruction was negative (i.e., to not be recruited). Results of this experiment (N = 85 French participants) confirm our hypothesis and revealed a strong interaction effect between level of language abstraction and goal of self-presentation. Implications for linguistic bias effect and normative behavior in the interpersonal context of recruitment are discussed.",0,1
"1. In recent years there have been a number of interesting attempts to redefine the prehistoric stages of Germanic.* The need for such a redefinition has long been evident, as van Coetsem, Makaev, and Lehmann have all pointed out.' One of the reasons for this need is undoubtedly to be found in the prevailing view of a protolanguage as an entity which is 'timeless, non-dialectal, and non-phonetic', and therefore unreal.2 Pulgram, for example, considers 'Reconstructed Proto-Indo-European' (in contrast to 'Real Proto-Indo-European')3 to be a 'timeless structure which is diachronically heterogeneous, though synchronically uniform' (425). This characterization of our reconstruction of ProtoIndo-European may be accurate, but it is questionable whether all protolanguages are equally 'timeless', at least in the relative sense. The younger protolanguages which we can reconstruct within the Indo-European family, such as Proto-Germanic and Proto-Romance, cannot be placed in an identical frame of reference with Proto-Indo-European. The latter is reconstructible only on the basis of internal evidence. The younger protolanguages, however, have the added advantage of disposing over comparative evidence from related languages outside their limited groups to provide them with additional depth. This is perhaps what Bloomfield had in mind when he made an exception of Proto-Germanic and Proto-Romance to his general rule that the comparative method 'cannot claim to picture the historical process' (318). It is of course true that the triangulation methods4 of comparative linguistics lead to fixed points in time and space.5 It is not true, however, that all triangulation lines plotted for a protolanguage such as Proto-Germanic meet in a single, chronologically uniform point. It is quite clear from internal evidence, for example, that the Germanic accent shift must have occurred after the consonant shift",0,1
"It comes as a surprise that a dictionary like the one under review has never been attempted before. However, it is good to remember that we also lack similar dictionaries for other major pluricentric languages such as English, French or Spanish. Whereas descriptions of lexical deviances of individual varieties of German here covered do exist in the form of monographs, word lists and dictionaries (cf. Ebner 1998, Meyer 1989, Wolf 2000), a combination of such data (which is necessary for valid comparisons) has never been achieved. As explained in the detailed introduction, three research teams organized by the initiator of the enterprise, Ulrich Ammon (who sketched the project in 1997), collected some 12,000 words and phrases of cases where the standard diction of the seven regions investigated (marked A, CH, D, LIE, LUX, BELG and STIR) differs. The lexis of German in, say, Alsace or Transylvania, where the language has no official functions, is not covered.",0,1
"Making correct and informed decisions on labelling usage in dictionaries is notoriously difficult. Lexicographers have been searching in vain for an exhaustive and precise answer to the questions of which words to label in what kind of dictionaries and how to do it. These are purely practical problems. However, they stem from the lack of a firm theoretical basis for the application of diasystematic information (i.e. information about restrictions on usage) in dictionaries. Accordingly, the aim of this article is twofold: (1) to investigate the causes of the unsatisfactory theoretical treatment of diasystematic information, and (2) to outline some general, theoretical guidelines for making adequate judgements concerning usage labelling. An examination of selected literature reveals that diasystematic information is treated chiefly from the formal perspective, the main focus being the identification of linguistic phenomena rather than the needs of the dictionary user. A strictly functional approach to lexicography, on the other hand, lacks the formal description of information. Both perspectives do have some advantages, though. Combining the methods of a formal, linguistically determined approach and those of a functional perspective can provide a solid methodological framework for lexicographers to make decisions concerning usage labelling.",0,1
"This paper proposes a typologically informed hypothesis for the origins of the lack of differentiation between ‘ who ?’ and ‘ what ?’ in several Bantu languages of zone C. It is argued that the zone C general interrogatives ‘ who ? / what ?’, as well as ‘ who ?’ interrogatives in numerous other Bantu languages commonly reconstructed as * n(d) a(n) i ‘ who ?’, have developed out of a selective interrogative ‘ which one ?’ and ultimately a locative interrogative construction *[ ag9(or ag7) cop cl16 ‘ what ?’] ‘(it) is where ?’. Formally, the latter clause-level construction underwent univerbation and a subsequent formal reduction with occasional reinforcement by a postposed demonstrative root. An important conclusion is that no interrogative pronominal meaning ‘ who ?’ can be reconstructed for Proto Bantu.",0,1
"Immigrants from one dialect region to another acquire features of the new dialect with varying degrees of proficiency. In modern societies regional mobility is commonplace, and for modern dialectology, involved as it is with variability, mechanisms of change, and adaptation, it is a rich source of hypotheses. This article postulates eight general principles by which immigrants adapt dialectologically to their new surroundings, based mainly on results of a developmental study of six Canadian youngsters in two families who moved to southern England in 1983 and 1984, with supporting evidence from several other studies. The principles provide a set of empirically testable hypotheses about the determinants of dialect acquisition.",0,1

The desahogo functions as a verbal avenue through which interlocutors, in this case callers, express frustration about the service received, even if remedial action is unlikely to occur.",0,1
"Why are some linguistic inferences treated as presuppositions? This is the ‘Triggering Problem,’ which we attack from a new angle: we investigate highly iconic constructions in gestures (speech-replacing gestures or ‘pro-speech gestures’) and in signs (classifier predicates in ASL) and show that some regularly trigger presuppositions. These iconic constructions can be created and understood ‘on the fly,’ with two advantages over lexical words: they suggest the existence of a productive ‘triggering algorithm,’ since presuppositions can arguably be generated with no prior exposure to the iconic construction; and they make it possible to minimally modify the target constructions to determine which do and which do not generate presuppositions. Our investigation does not just target standard presuppositions, but also ‘cosuppositions,’ initially defined as conditionalized presuppositions triggered by co-speech gestures. We show that pro-speech gestures and classifier predicates alike can trigger cosuppositions, which are thus an inferential class that goes beyond the confines of co-speech gestures (Aristodemo 2017). Our data argue for a triggering algorithm that can generate presuppositions on iconic grounds, and we offer a generalization of cosupposition theory on which these can be triggered for reasons of manner (co-speech gestures), but also for conceptual reasons.",0,1
"This study aims to explore how university students of English as a foreign language perceive themselves as multilingual agents, how they practice their languages, and how this affects their identity. The study is based on Kramsch’s notion of third place (1993) which considers foreign language learning as an opportunity for the construction of interculturality, thus causing learners to redefine themselves as they hybridise their cultural identity. Data is gathered through an interview and a focus group discussion with 32 English language learning students at a public university in Morocco. The data is thematically analyzed and discussed. Findings indicate that multilingual learners think positively of multilingualism and avail themselves of their languages, using all of them but in different contexts. They also claim they experience identity shift, thus sustaining and developing multiple identities flexibly thanks to the languages they use. Such findings indicate that multilingual students are defining and redefining their cultural identities as modern, global, open and intercultural citizens under the impact of multilingualism. In light of the results obtained, some implications are discussed.",0,1

"BOOK NOTICES 403 scheme (75) should be revised per Hoffner, Kanissuwar (1986), and in 6.41 (85) there is no evidence that nu means 'now' in the sense implied (or any other). The statement that 'number concord between subject and verb is more according to meaning than to strict grammatical rules' (93) is incorrect, and (as noted on 94) is certainly not justified by the example cited: the grammatical rule that neuter plurals agree with singular verbs is not mentioned. The reading selections also include errors, e.g. the adoption of the reading HUL-lawahzi 'injures' on 11415 , lines 21-22, rather than the correct variant idalauwanni 'for harm' (which HS&G's translation follows); omitted are kuitki 'something' on 117, line 49, -as 'them' on 128, line 70, and -kan on 128, line 74. Also in the readings, the interlinear translation is often wrongly aligned with the Hittite; e.g., IR-s = a 'but a slave' (124, line 25) seems to be glossed 'that slave'. The glossary does not distinguish man 'if and the optative particle man. Omissions are inevitable from a grammatical sketch ofthis length. Still, some mention should have been made of the verbal suffix -annäi-, the 'ergative' in -anza, and the respectively abstract , collective, and factitive functions of the suffixes -atar (not '-tar' [24]), -essar (not '-sar' [24]), and -ahh-. The verbal noun in -war should be treated with the participles (it is mentioned only with nominal morphology [25]). Ex. 5.73d (73) presents an opportunity to discuss verb serialization , which is only alluded to in the glossary under pair (159) and uit (164-65). Some minor points are confusing. Although wa-al-ahmi ? attack' has (as HS&G state on 39) a typical monosyllabic root ending in two consonants, that fact is unclear from the form cited, and a student should be told that the root is walh- and why it is not *walah-. One might also suppose (wrongly) from the wording on 41 that the infix -nin- appears in other than velar-final roots. The distribution of the two infinitive endings could be clarified in one or two more sentences. The discussion of orthography is at times misleading . For example, after referring to a 'paucity of signs denoting e- plus a following consonant' (6), HS&G question the standard explanation of the initial V-C spelling of e-te-ir 'they ate': since 'there is no sign *et, the only other possibility' would be 'it' (9). In fact no such 'paucity' exists: while there are, for instance , separate EN and IN signs, many signs are polyvalent; in this case there is one sign with the two readings ET and IT, not an IT sign. The standard view correctly explains the nonexistence of a spelling *et-te-: orthographic -t-t- = IxI and -V-/- = IaI, and the root 'eat' has IdI. Elsewhere, orthographic variation is too willingly attributed to nonlinguistic factors; for example , 'vacillation' (8) explains the initial CVC vs. CV-VC spellings in ki-sa-at 'he became"" (active) vs. ki-is-ha-ha-at ? became' (middle). In fact the latter is required by the consonantinitial ending -hhahat. Finally, even if HS&G do not accept the (common) Eichner/Kimball view of vowel length, more comment and upto -date references would be in order on pp. 89 ; the important phonological phenomenon of lenition should also be discussed. Because BH 'is a descriptive and not a diachronic grammar, no effort has been made to separately describe the three stages [sc. of Hittite ] in any detail' (11): paradigms mix linguistic features of different ages—e.g. 1st sg. près, -hé vs. -hi and demonstrative nom. pi. kè, apè vs. kits, apüs—and the sign list does not distinguish Old, Middle, and New Script variants. This procedure is inherited from all the standard texts, which predate most of the linguistic and paléographie dating techniques now known. In my view, however, these have become so essential to work in Hittite that a new text should introduce them at the beginning. The errors in this book warrant caution, and its omissions mean that it will not be useful long after a student finishes its reading selections. An up-to-date Hittite text is a desideratum, but...",0,1
"As multi/plurilingual research advances understandings of plurilingual speakers’ fluid language use, particularly in multilingual settings, new research methods and pedagogical orientations that address this complex phenomenon are needed. The present study considered the development, reliability, and validity of the Plurilingual and Pluricultural Competence (PPC) scale. Informed by sociolinguistics theories in educational linguistics, including plurilingualism and translanguaging, the PPC scale had its content validated by researchers, language teachers and learners. It was then implemented with 379 plurilingual speakers in two multilingual cities in Canada: 129 in Toronto and 250 in Montréal. Exploratory factor analysis examined the factors in the scale and whether PPC referred to language and culture as separate dimensions or, as theoretically suggested, a unidimensional construct. Results reveal PPC as one construct, suggesting that language and culture are interrelated. With 22 items on a 4-point Likert scale, the PPC scale is a new instrument that can be used in future multi/plurilingual research and pedagogy. Its significance lies in that the scale can gather overall trends among plurilinguals’ PPC levels, which can have implications for language education, curriculum and policy. Recommendations for future use are discussed.",0,1

Auf diese Weise - so sagt der Erzähler - wird zum ersten Mal ein Spiel namens ‚Dachs im Sack‘ (oder ‚Dachs im Beutel‘) gespielt. Diese Benennung lenkt allerdings davon ab, was eigentlich gemeint ist. Ein Dachs spielt in dieser Geschichte keine Rolle, und worum es wirklich geht, ist das Konzept ‚jemanden im Sack haben‘ oder ‚jemanden in den Sack stecken‘. Vergleichbare Ausdrücke sind schon im Mittelalter in mehreren Sprachen bekannt und verweisen möglicherweise auf eine wirkliche Art von Zweikampf. Die entsprechende Erwähnung in dieser walisischen Geschichte scheint der bislang älteste Beleg für diesen Ausdruck zu sein.",0,1
"Abstract Oyster Bilingual School in Washington, D.C. is one of the oldest, continuously-running two-way bilingual programs in the nation. Some of the innovations that have helped sustain the school's success have been strong parental and community support, maintenance of high academic standards, and ongoing professional development efforts. Cultural, generational, and socioeconomic differences among staff, students, and parents have caused philosophical conflict in the school community; this situation needs to be addressed through professional development activities. Decreasing funds have limited the school's ability to expand and adopt new technologies; this may be resolved through Oyster community activism to gamer political support for better financial and human resources.",0,1
"INTERTEXTUALITY and the DICTIONARY: TOWARD A DECONSTRUCTIONIST ACCOUNT OF LEXICOGRAPHY William Frawley 1. Introduction The purpose of this paper is to give a philosophical account of the dictionary from the standpoint of post-structural, deconstructionist, literary criticism. The motivation for looking at the dictionary in this manner is that while linguists and lexicographers have devoted a great amount of attention to the structure of the dictionary, few researchers, if any, have concerned themselves with the dictionary simply as a phenomenon, or, more specifically, as a written phenomenon. Granted, there have been sociological studies of the dictionary —the book as a social phenomenon (e.g., McDavid, 1979; Malkiel, 1980; Baker, 1972)—but these studies are, if the circularity can be pardoned, sociological, and thus they center on the role of the dictionary in society, not on the dictionary itself as a textual phenomenon. Recent deconstructionist literary criticim, however, with its focus on looking at literature (indeed, all knowledge) as texts, can provide us with a theoretical vocabulary for explaining the textual phenomenon (embedded in other textual phenomena) that our culture conventionally calls a ""dictionary."" Work by Barthes (1979), Culler (1981, 1982), Derrida (1974, 1978), Leitch (1983), and Kristeva (1980), and the excellent essays to be found in Harari (1979) and Spanos, Bové, and O'Hara (1982) give us the philosophical foundations for a theory of texts that can account for lexicography as a form of writing and thus explaining the dictionary as the product of a certain kind of written activity in much the same way as history, philosophy, and physics are explained as written activities that engender texts for the disciplinary canon (see, e.g., White, 1973; Rorty, 1978; Foucault, 1972). In the essay that follows, I will make no attempt to spell out post-structuralist criticism in its entirety; I do so not out of sadism for those unfamiliar with the deconstructionist project, 1 Intertextuality and the Dictionary but, in fact, out of sympathy, since the literature on the subject is too vast and often too idiosyncratically technical to give the project a fair (pardon the pun) writing. Instead, I will explain the assumptions and claims of deconstructionism as I go along and give only those points relevant to the explanation of the dictionary as a written phenomenon. (The interested reader is enjoined to consult Leitch, 1983, or Culler, 1982, for excellent introductions to the full project.) 2. The Dictionary as Writing The deconstructionist project is to look at all texts as the consequence of a more general activity called ""writing"" (écriture). Barthes (1979) and Derrida (1974) have gone to great pains to articulate the features of this more general activity, and Derrida's commentary is perhaps the most lucid: Now we tend to say 'writing' for all that and more: to designate not only the physical gestures of literal pictographic or ideographic inscription, but also the totality of what makes it possible; and also, beyond the signifying face, the signified face itself. And thus we say 'writing' for all that gives rise to an inscription in general, whether it is literal or not and even if what it distributes in space is alien to the order of the voice: cinematography, of course, but also pictorial, musical, sculptural 'writing' .... All this to describe not only the system of notations secondarily connected with these activities but the essence and content of these activities themselves (Derrida, 1974:9). Writing is anything that contributes to the production of an inscribed sign, but it is viewed as faceless (see Foucault, 1979), authorless, a historically conditioned activity that has as its by-products the objects that we call ""texts."" Writing is, furthermore, primary in a literate culture; this is related to what Derrida (1974) calls ""logocentrism,"" or the Western rationale that meanings are primary and that signs serve only William Frawley to express them. The practical consequence of such a project for, at least, literary criticism is that one no longer looks at literature in authorial/biographical terms (since the author exists only as his/her texts), in classic aesthetic terms (since aesthetics is also just another way of writing and thus has no a priori value in judging a text), or in terms...",0,1

"We examined a consistent deficit observed in bilinguals: poorer speech-in-noise (SIN) comprehension for their nonnative language. We recorded neuroelectric mismatch potentials in mono- and bi-lingual listeners in response to contrastive speech sounds in noise. Behaviorally, late bilinguals required ∼10 dB more favorable signal-to-noise ratios to match monolinguals’ SIN abilities. Source analysis of cortical activity demonstrated monotonic increase in response latency with noise in superior temporal gyrus (STG) for both groups, suggesting parallel degradation of speech representations in auditory cortex. Contrastively, we found differential speech encoding between groups within inferior frontal gyrus (IFG)—adjacent to Broca’s area—where noise delays observed in nonnative listeners were offset in monolinguals. Notably, brain-behavior correspondences double dissociated between language groups: STG activation predicted bilinguals’ SIN, whereas IFG activation predicted monolinguals’ performance. We infer higher-order brain areas act compensatorily to enhance impoverished sensory representations but only when degraded speech recruits linguistic brain mechanisms downstream from initial auditory-sensory inputs.",0,1
"THE DATA FOR THE PRESENT STUDY have been gathered from three sources.' The first is a publication of the American Trucking Association, in which a majority of the terms were found.2 The second is an article published in 1955, detailing the jargon of the truck driver at that time.3 The third is my own sociological study of truck drivers, for which I spent a great deal of time in participant observation.4 The data for my study were gathered through the use of three different research methods. A random sample of 150 union truck drivers in the New York metropolitan area was contacted by a mail questionnaire in the summer of 1969. Additional data were received from in-depth interviews held with drivers who had indicated on the questionnaire an interest in being interviewed. These interviews, held with twenty or so drivers, often lasted from six to eight hours. Finally, data were gathered in the participant observation phase of the research, during which I spent about a thousand hours hanging truck stops, truck garages, and truck terminals. In addition, I took a number of trips with drivers both locally (in and around the New York area) and long distance (from the New York area into the Midwest and as far as Battle Creek, Michigan). The interviews both in the formal interview situation and in the participant observation were focused rather than structured. I knew what I wanted to ask, and consequently I let the form of the questions be dictated by the situation in which I found myself. The lack of standardization is not crucial since every opportunity was taken to verify questionable data. Truck drivers' jargon appears to serve three distinct purposes: First, such jargon as or cackle crate enables the truck driver to express complexities without lengthy technical discussions. Second, such expressions as bobtailing a twin screw jimmy enable the truck driver to exclude from his conversation (whether consciously or not) those who are not truck drivers and",0,1

"The paper aims to establish a synergy between the lexicographic and natural language processing (NLP) communities in relation to concepts and classifications of multiword expressions (MWEs), their representation in dictionaries, dictionary databases, and NLP-oriented MWE lexicons. It begins with an overview of basic MWE-related linguistic concepts and how they are reflected in the lexicographic treatment of MWEs, as well as their role in language technology. A comparison of different lexicographic and NLP classifications of MWEs is presented, with an elaboration of why different typologies are (or are not) useful for different users from both communities. The methodology for the description of MWEs in a set of dictionary databases is discussed, and the results of an analysis of the representation of MWEs based on a small sample of dictionary projects are presented. Finally, some suggestions are provided on how to improve dictionary databases in relation to MWE description and how to improve the results of NLP tasks by using existing descriptions of MWEs in dictionaries.",0,1

"Abstracto La presente investigación compara las estrategias de impersonalización individualizadoras en el español peninsular y en el portugués europeo. Dichas estructuras incluyen pronombres y formas verbales como la segunda persona del singular y el pronombre indefinido-impersonal uno. La comparación entre español y portugués resulta interesante, ya que esta última lengua no dispone de un pronombre análogo a uno y el uso de la segunda persona del singular se demuestra limitado. En cambio, en el portugués europeo se emplea el sintagma nominal a/uma pessoa para expresar referencia impersonal. Un análisis cuantitativo de entrevistas sociolingüísticas demuestra que la expresión de la impersonalidad individual es más frecuente en español que en portugués. Aunque las estrategias de impersonalización nominales del portugués presentan indicios de gramaticalización, su uso no es tan generalizado como el del tú impersonal en español. Las diferencias observadas pueden relacionarse con factores culturales como la expresión de cortesía positiva y negativa.",0,1
"Dramatic demographic changes are rapidly reshaping the population of the United States in ways that make the research questions that motivated twentieth-century dialectology outmoded. This paper outlines some of the most important demographic changes currently affecting the United States and suggests some research questions that are implicit in those developments. While twentieth-century dialectology was driven by questions regarding the sociospatial structure of the Founder Dialects and their relationships to settlement history and British regional varieties, twenty-first-century dialectology must examine the linguistic consequences of newly emerging demographic divisions, the consequences of widespread urbanization, and the relationships between Anglo dialects and a rapidly growing non-Anglo population. These questions require some fundamental changes in how we do dialectology, but they also position the discipline in a way that will enable it to address fundamental social and educational issues that stand at the center of the intellectual life of the twenty-first century.",0,1
"Abstract There is a growing consensus that emotions contribute positively to human practical rationality. While arguments that defend this position often appeal to the modularity of emotion‐generation mechanisms, these arguments are also susceptible to the criticism that emotional modularity supports pessimism about the prospects of emotions contributing positively to practical rationality here and now . This paper aims to respond to this criticism by demonstrating how models of emotion processing can accommodate the sorts of cognitive influence required to make the pro‐emotion position plausible whilst exhibiting key elements of modularity.",0,1
"The task of determining and classifying the variety of meanings that can be associated with a word in different contexts is a classical topic in lexicography and lexical semantics. A method is needed to help lexicographers determine if two ‘candidate’ senses should be regarded as separate senses or as semantic variants of a single sense. Ambiguity tests provide a good starting point for such a classification, but must be applied with care. First, they cannot be applied to senses occurring in ‘incompatible’ syntactic contexts. Second, the process of determining a set of discrete senses should not be confused with the polysemy/homonymy distinction. Instead, argument structure alternations and some polysemic shifts are best interpreted as semantic relations among the set of word senses that results from application of ambiguity tests. In this article we will outline and motivate a lexicographic method that relies on ambiguity tests to provide the set of senses that forms the basis for additional thematic and polysemic analysis, and will demonstrate its application to the description of a highly polysemous word, the Spanish verb subir.",0,1

"This paper describes an English-Polish theoretical and empirical cognitive study of the axiological aspects of the concept(s) death/śmierć and conceptualizations to which they refer. The pragmatic tool of a language mask is presented and applied to death, a generally difficult topic. A two-part survey was conducted to test the valuing of expressions where death/śmierć was used in the literal sense and in figurative senses, often idiomatic and not referring to the end of life of an organism (Part 1), as well as expressions where death/śmierć was masked – conveyed indirectly, by means of other concepts – mostly using metaphors and metonyms (Part 2). Death is a carrier of negative axiological charge as a source domain of metaphors (as seen in Part 1). Metaphor and metonymy are treated as language masks, i.e., pragmatic tools of pretending, used to modulate the valuing of death/śmierć (in Part 2). Valuing of seemingly equivalent or similar expressions varies cross-linguistically. Humor is a very controversial aspect in terms of its axiological parameter.",0,1

By surveying the relevant literature on boredom and arousal, the paper makes a case for the unity of the construct of boredom. It argues, first, that extant empirical findings do not support the heterogeneity of boredom, and, second, that a theoretically motivated and empirically grounded model of boredom (the functional account) supports the view that the construct of boredom is a unitary one.",0,1

"Background noise challenges auditory recognition of speech and may reveal the underlying deficits in auditory word recognition skills. Previous studies have reported an association between children’s auditory skills and various linguistic skills, including phonology, although in some languages only. However, language-specific features influence these connections. This study describes the associations between auditory word recognition ability and phonological skills in a representative group of 3;6-year-old children in less studied language, Finnish (N = 65). Auditory recognition was assessed using a closed-set word recognition task presented in multi-talker babble noise (+13 dB) and the phonological skills using Finnish Phonology Test. A significant, moderate correlation was found between Finnish-speaking children’s auditory word recognition and phonological skills. The late-developing phoneme /r/ challenged word recognition. The sibilant /s/ was noted to be the most noise resistant consonant, and the phoneme pair /r/ and /l/ created the most mutual confusion. The accuracy of phonological representations may be a moderating factor for both auditory recognition and phonological skills. Children with strong phonological skills may recognize spoken words more accurately in noisy everyday situations than children with weaker phonological skills. This should be taken into consideration in children’s daily environments, such as daycare centers and preschools.",0,1

We have argued that although they rely on conceptually different views about the phenomenon, they share various insights, and we argued that their empirical differences were more subtle than what one may have expected. In this second part of this review paper, we will sample some experimental results with two goals in mind. First, we will exemplify some simplifications that are found in the literature and examine the consequences of these simplifications on the interpretability of experimental results. Second, we will suggest future directions that the experimental turn might consider exploring, directions that seem to us to have the potential to illuminate the richness of the competing theories and the potential to dissociate or improve them.",0,1

However, these works are concerned primarily with how to treat the data after it has been collected so that the analysis will be statistically valid.

Yet the methods used for the collection of data are equally as important as the means of analyzing the data if the results are to be reliable and valid.",0,1
"0. The purpose of this paper' is to test the validity of the oft-repeated proposition that we can not handle meaning linguistically, by attempting to evolve an empirical procedure for the processing of semantic field data, which can then be evaluated in terms of the criteria of consistency, exhaustiveness, and simplicity.2 This procedure will be applied to a minimum semantic contrast in grammar-the difference in grammatical meaning correlated with the presence or the absence of a single paradigmatic morpheme. I shall call this correlation a GRAMMATICAL CATEGORY, and the contrasting morphemic units the GRAMMATICAL FORMS of this category. The language concerned is Kutenai,3 spoken by about 500 Indians in Idaho, Montana, and British Columbia. The grammatical category has by Boas4 been called OBVIATION, by false analogy with a grammatical category in Algonquian; the grammatical forms of this category will be called OBVIATIVE FORMS (or FORMS IN THE OBVIATIVE) if they contain the OBVIATIVE SUFFIX (to be described below), ABSOLUTE FORMS (or FORMS IN THE ABSOLUTE) if they do not. The choice of an exotic language has been deliberate, in order to eliminate as far as possible any 'intuitive feel' for meanings and to rely instead on a verifiable procedure. I have selected obviation to exemplify the general problem, partly because of its intrinsic interest, partly because it serves to illustrate rather conspicuously some of the operational difficulties. As will become clear below, obviation has extremely wide distribution within the language, both in terms of sequential possibilities and in terms of frequency of occurrence; its function (and meaning) can therefore be considered central to the structure. It has no equivalent, either distributionally or semantically, in any one Indo-European grammatical category. There is no immediately apparent correlation between obviation and any feature of external reality or of Kutenai nonlinguistic culture, and direct translations of obviative as opposed to absolute forms are extremely difficult to obtain.",0,1
"The paper focuses on the mutual relations between linguistics and lexicography. Against the background of etymology and comparative-historical linguistic studies and using the words 'lexical' and 'culture' as examples, an attempt is made to demonstrate the relevance of morphology, grammar and semantics to the description of vocabulary and its lexicographic codification. Issues of intralingual variety and interlingual diversity can now also be addressed within the theoretical framework of contrastive textology, supported by computer-aided parallel text corpus analysis. However, lexicography is not entirely dependent on the results of linguistic research; it needs to move on and develop its own theoretical base. Recent progress in four fields of dictionary research has indeed contributed to an international upsurge of 'lexical culture'.",0,1
"Abstract Funeral and mourning rites capture so many aspects of the Iranian traditional and religious rituals and provide members of society with cultural tools of lamenting the dead. The study presents socio-cultural considerations in connection with social space and action, linguistic interactions, and semiotic resources of rituals used in mourning ceremonies for Shiite Muslims in the city of Nur, Iran. The paper relies on a mediated discourse analysis approach as a theoretical framework from which to develop a semiotic analysis of the linguistic practices and mediational means that appear in the mourning events. To this end, I shall draw upon video and audio recorded interactions of mourning rituals personally collected at funerals. The paper demonstrates that while mourning rituals are culturally and religiously framed in Shiite Muslims, one must also include the social space, the discourse cycle, the trajectories of the material resource of individual’s historical bodies and of text.",0,1

Based on the available research, we suggest that additional studies are called for on the following issues: (a) L2 DA as an approach to measurement, (b) potential mediators, (c) validity issues of L2 DA, (d) the interface between DA and second language acquisition, and (e) the development of L2 classroom teachers.",0,1

Through this illustrative account, the study aims to highlight the ways in which, in spite of a national policy that proclaims the pre-eminence of the French language, immigrant communities in Belleville succeed in gaining visibility in the linguistic landscape. It also seeks to explore the ways in which written signs, as well as other discursive modalities such as images and elements of architecture, enact cultural diversity in Belleville's linguistic landscape. The study also documents the impact of the English language on Belleville's linguistic landscape. Specifically, the analysis highlights the influence of English syntax in shop and business names, and the use of English as a symbol of cosmopolitanism and globalisation. The study is supplemented by the metalinguistic remarks and insights of individual actors regarding their choice of language for their business names.",0,1

"The given-new contract entails that speakers must distinguish for their addressee whether references are new or already part of their dialogue. Past research had found that, in a monologue to a listener, speakers shortened repeated words. However, the notion of the given-new contract is inherently dialogic, with an addressee and the availability of co-speech gestures. Here, two face-to-face dialogue experiments tested whether gesture duration also follows the given-new contract. In Experiment 1, four experimental sequences confirmed that when speakers repeated their gestures, they shortened the duration significantly. Experiment 2 replicated the effect with spontaneous gestures in a different task. This experiment also extended earlier results with words, confirming that speakers shortened their repeated words significantly in a multimodal dialogue setting, the basic form of language use. Because words and gestures were not necessarily redundant, these results offer another instance in which gestures and words independently serve pragmatic requirements of dialogue.",0,1

My aim is to amplify, considerably beyond the evidence offered in unabridged dictionaries, evidence of the extraordinary influence the dog has exerted in the many, widely separated areas in which his name has been used-used not merely to name but to praise, condemn, caress, ridicule, or disvalue creatures or things with which it is associated.2 After all, it is man's intervention that has made the genus Canis the most varied on earth, and the dog has, so to speak, reacted in kind in his contribution to the economy of man's language. The beginnings of this dual process go back to the earliest efforts of human beings3 to give names to, and thereby win control over, the essential things in the bewildering universe",0,1

"Children learn math concepts long before they enter school. Across all cultures, children are exposed to number and spatial language to varying degrees during everyday home routines. Yet most studies of math talk occur in the lab and target non-Hispanic, English-speaking families. We expanded inquiry to the spontaneous math language (i.e., number and spatial language) of Spanish-speaking mothers and their 1- to 2-year-olds (N = 50) during home activities. Mothers varied enormously in their use of math language, and mother math language related to toddler math language, whereas mother non-math language did not. Children’s math language both preceded and followed mother math talk, suggesting imitation and reinforcement as important processes in children’s math language learning. Children also produced math language outside the context of mother input. Findings advance an understanding of children’s early math language in natural settings and have implications for interventions aimed at promoting math skills in toddlers from diverse backgrounds.",0,1
"Este trabajo resena y ejemplifica la perspectiva desarrollada respecto del analisis de genero, por el grupo denominado Escuela de Sydney. Comienza con una breve resena historica de este enfoque y despues la ilustra con el analisis del texto de un folleto de museo sobre el tejido de frazadas por indigenas americanos. Primero se aborda el problema de distinguir un genero de otro en relacion con las formas linguisticas que los configuran. A continuacion, se consideran los textos que abarcan mas de un genero. El objetivo principal de este trabajo es desarrollar una orientacion linguistica funcional respecto a los textos como configuraciones de significado y la complementariedad de las perspectivas tipologicas y topologicas en las relaciones entre generos.",0,1
"Abstract The article discusses the connection between the syntactic and semantic properties of weak, strong, and referential DP subjects. In particular, I argue that nominal expressions possess a situation argument and that their interpretation and their distribution follow from the presuppositional requirements that the determiner imposes on the individual argument and situation argument of its complement nominal. These presuppositional requirements, I then argue, are embodied by local relations of the subject to a distinct head in the C domain, Fin 0 in the system of Rizzi 1997, where specific referential values of discourse antecedents are accessible.",0,1

"What is it that makes humor difficult to understand and appreciate in a second language (L2)? Despite advances in research in both L2 pragmatics and humor studies, scholars have as yet had little to say on this topic. In interviews, learners themselves pinpoint culture, vocabulary, and the speed at which playful talk often takes place as difficulties. Yet, as we know, hypothetical self-reports of language use can be quite unreliable. Thus, this exploratory study aimed to examine L2 understanding of humor more systematically. Six advanced non-native speakers (NNSs) of English kept diaries in which they recorded their experiences with humor in English over an eight-week period. Group meetings were also held every two weeks during this time to allow the participants to elaborate on, interpret, and discuss their experiences. For the present study, all instances of failed humor were extracted and coded. These were used to construct a typology of failed humor, which identifies seven levels at which a speaker may fail to successfully engage in a humorous exchange. The data suggest that NNS failures differ from those of NSs largely from a quantitative, but not qualitative, standpoint.",0,1
"The units postulated in linguistic analysis differ not only as to their structural properties, but also in their relative frequency of use in different contexts: the former should, ideally, shed light on the latter. Such a connection between linguistic analysis of the system and the use to which it is put requires an understanding of what constitutes ‘appropriate’ use of a form, and an appeal to psychologically plausible cognitive processes. The need to make psychological sense of linguistic frequency data is discussed on the basis of distributional skewings in the exploitation of stronger vs. weaker deictic devices in Spanish, Portuguese and Dutch, with special attention for the problem posed by competing strategies.",0,1
"Most recent speech codecs employ code excited linear prediction (CELP) and transmit side information to improve speech quality under packet loss. Another approach to achieve high robustness to packet loss is to use the frame independent coding scheme based on the internet low bitrate codec (iLBC). The scalable wideband speech codec based on the iLBC was previously presented and outperformed G.729.1 at most bit rates according to the objective quality. This paper presents improvements to the previous work. Specifically, we employ the wavelet packet transform (WPT) instead of the modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT) to enhance the quality, and evaluate the proposed codec based on both the objective and subjective quality measures. The objective quality evaluation results show that clear improvement is achieved and that the proposed codec outperforms G.729.1 at the bit rate of 18 kbps or higher under clean channel conditions and has higher robustness to packet loss than G.729.1. The informal subjective test results also show similar trends.",0,1
"This paper was read at an Elementary German In-Service Session, sponsored by the Professional Development Branch, Manitoba Department of Education in co-operation with the Manitoba Elementary German Curriculum Committee, May 29-31, 1972. Any attempt to minimize or overemphasize the role of grammar in second language learning and teaching, needs to be put into perspective or else the discussion might develop into another methodological :fist-fighting contest, resulting in irrevocable and long-lasting pedagogical injuries. The opponents: Mr. No-Grammar-at-all versus Mr. Grammar- is-the-one-and-onlyremedy have established by now, after several centuries, a long record of famous and well-publicized professional encounters. Both of them can boast of numerous glorious victories and some technical knock-outs. But both of them seem to have lost their ideological vigour, which in the past drew large, enthusiastic audiences. These large audiences have long gone, but our aging methodological warriors still attract supporters, young and old, pro and contra, who forcefully and :fiercely follow their champions without recognizing that times have changed.",0,1
"This article offers a brief overview of the compilation of the Ndebele music terms dictionary, Isichazamazwi SezoMculo (henceforth the ISM), paying particular attention to its struc-tural features. It emphasises that the reference needs of the users as well as their reference skills should be given a determining role in all lexicographic decisions leading to the publication of a dictionary. Dictionary structure should, therefore, be conceived and evaluated in terms of its data constituents and the accessibility of these data. Accordingly, this article demonstrates that the structure of the ISM is not a case of mere cosmetics but a lexicographic mode of communication between the dictionary compilers and users who are participants in a lexicographic communication process. In this way, the article highlights some of the challenges encountered during the com-pilation of the ISM and the strategies the compilers employed to facilitate the communication pro-cess between the lexicographers and the users regarding dictionary contents and the arrangement thereof. From such a perspective, this article may provide useful insights for LSP lexicography in African languages, prospects of which are based on the increased need for knowledge acquisition and dissemination as well as the multilingual nature of African societies.

"This article discusses the physiological changes that accompany normal aging and current understandings of how environmental factors interact with a person's genetic mechanisms to slow or speed up the aging process. Chronological age is contrasted with biological age to illustrate the different rates and extent of anatomical changes and functional declines observed in older people of the same age, behaviors that appear to delay or reduce the inevitable progression of sensescence, the extraordinary heterogeneity of the aging population, and the complexity of the processes responsible for the consequences of human aging.",0,1
"This article discusses a study of the relationship between movements of the head and the torso in Finnish Sign Language (FinSL). It describes the differences and similarities in the articulation of these two body parts in FinSL narratives, and discusses the status and relationship of the head and the torso as articulators in sign languages. The study reveals that, in FinSL narratives, the head is clearly more active than the torso. When both the torso and the head moved, almost half of the co-occurrences were found to be simple combinations of codirectional movements, while slightly more than half of the co- occurrences were semicomplex or complex combinations with differences in the direction of the movements. Most of the co- occurring torso and head movements shared the same function, regardless of the degree of complexity of the combination. However, differences in the functions of torso and head movements were found to increase as the complexity of the combined movements grew.",0,1

"Abstract This article studies the various suppletive patterns found with respect to the Romance movement verb go , both under a diachronic and a synchronic perspective, within the framework of Distributed Morphology (DM). The Romance varieties all started with the loss of verbal forms of Lat. īre – indeed, there is no Romance variety that retained the full paradigm – but reached different solutions in diachrony. A particular case, implemented by underspecified Vocabulary Items in DM, is overlapping suppletion, as found in Spanish, where the absolute default auxiliary be shares part of its forms with go . In this article, different types of suppletion are distinguished and selected aspects of suppletion are analysed in order to illustrate how DM can systematically account for them. From the perspective of DM, we discuss why non‐categorial suppletion is restricted to the present tense, how resistance to innovation of 1/2pl can be modelled and how subsequent analogical levelling can be formalised. Finally, we show why, as in Ibero‐Romance, forms of be can be used for go .",0,1
"The present paper reports two ERP experiments in Polish that examined the processing of mismatches between perfective and imperfective verbs and temporal modifiers, which preceded the VP (Experiment 1) and followed it (Experiment 2). The mismatch between perfective verb and a preceding durative adverbial elicited an N400 on the object. No ERP effect was found for the analogous mismatch between imperfective verbs and a preceding time-span adverbial. The mismatching temporal adverbial elicited an early positivity (potentially an early P600) when it followed a perfective VP and a LAN when it followed an imperfective VP. The results suggest that: (i) the domain of aspectual interpretation in Polish is a VP; (ii) mismatches with perfective and imperfective verbs are resolved differently depending on the degree of their semantic specificity (only semantically underspecified imperfective verbs can be easily adjusted to the requirements of the preceding context); (iii) the position of the temporal adverbial plays a role in that a preverbal adverbial sets up a frame within which the eventuality should be interpreted and the aspectual value computed on AspP can be potentially adjusted to it (semantic integration reflected in N400), whereas a post-verbal adverbial must agree with the aspectual value already computed on AspP (syntactic integration reflected in an early positivity or a LAN).",0,1
"This article analyses the discursive construction of mobile, multilingual humanitarian workers at the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) from a critical sociolinguistic perspective. In the light of fluctuating linguistic requirements and needs, I focus on the trajectories of ICRC delegates as a window onto the different values attributed to language resources and investments before and during humanitarian work. The data analysed include interviews with three (former) delegates complemented by institutional documents. The ICRC requirement for major languages including English and French goes hand in hand with recent personality profiling in relation to ‘international experience’ (understood as geographical mobility), which is closely connected to cosmopolitan discourses of openness to other cultures and languages. The three delegates mobilised the trope of ‘interest’ in other cultures and languages in connection to their transnational families. Simultaneously, they expanded their linguistic repertoires during their missions, often ‘bits and pieces’ of local languages, to respond to unplanned linguistic needs in the field and to manage interpreters in ways that reinforce power relationships. I argue that linguistic investment in non-strategic languages like Kurdish during humanitarian missions seldom translates into economic capital, but it is converted into symbolic capital indexing their professional mobility and flexible, entrepreneurial speakerhood.",0,1
"Purpose: Research has widely documented that several home-based literacy activities such as storytelling, shared book reading and exposure to print, support children's language and literacy development. This study explored home literacy practices (HLP) in a sample of Arab mothers from Kuwait.Method: A questionnaire to gather information about HLP was distributed to mothers of children aged two to five years (N = 243). Several variables were examined including maternal education, child age and child gender.Results: The findings indicated that Kuwaiti mothers engage their children in certain HLP, albeit irregularly. Examination of scores for four home literacy routines (reading stories, telling stories, teaching numbers and letters, and reciting nursery rhymes) as a function of maternal level of education revealed that mothers with post-secondary training were significantly higher than those of mothers with less education. The participants were more likely to teach alphabet letters and numbers to older preschoolers (four to five years) than to younger ones (two to three years). No significant group differences emerged with respect to the child's gender.Conclusion: The study underscores the need for outreach programs and family guidance in fostering emergent literacy within the home environment.",0,1
"The reasons for its continual usage are not hard to find. It is a metaphor that has its origins deep in the human psyche and in the culture of primitive communities. Many psychologists have observed that cooking is frequently equated with the process of pregnancy and birth, and that the womb is the stove inside which the child is baked. The ancient gods such as Zeus were conceived of as millers and their consorts as mills; the human race was the product they ground and baked, and on a terrestrial scale, man and woman performed similar functions.2 An awareness of the significance of the metaphor accounts for the importance of grain in certain rituals in ancient Greece and Rome.

"AbstractLanguage education policies are policies that inform the ways in which languages should be taught, learned, used and assessed in educational institutions. They are usually created with a view to support the development or the maintenance of particular languages, as it is often believed that schools play an important role in shaping language practices in society at large. This paper aims to give an overview of the major types of language education policies for young learners currently available in Europe, including “foreign” language education, bilingual and multilingual education. It also aims to highlight how these language education policies are underpinned by various ideologies and understandings of “language” and “bilingualism”. We argue that Language Education Policies (LEPs) need to be conceptualised as being multi-layered and dynamic processes, which need to involve all educational actors for them to lead to students’ success and sustained bi/multilingual development. Finally, this paper discusses two examples of multilingual language education policies for young learners in Europe, one in Luxembourg for pre-primary education and one in Ireland for primary education, with a view to highlight possible trajectories towards the creation and implementation of multilingual language education policies. It is hoped that this paper will inform language education policy makers, researchers and actors on current developments and challenges related to language education policy in Europe.RésuméLes politiques linguistiques éducatives concernent les choix de différentes modalités d’enseignement, d’apprentissage et d’évaluation des langues dans les institutions éducatives. En général elles sont élaborées afin de soutenir ou de maintenir le développement de langues spécifiques, puisqu’il est admis que l’école joue un rôle central sur les pratiques linguistiques à l’oeuvre dans la société. Dans ce chapitre nous visons à donner une vue d’ensemble des principaux types de politiques linguistiques éducatives élaborées ces dernières années en Europe pour les jeunes apprenants, tel que l’enseignement des langues dites étrangères et l’enseignement bilingue et multilingue. Nous montrons également comment ces politiques linguistiques sont empruntés de différentes idéologies et conceptualisations du langage et du bilinguisme. Nous défendons l’idée que les politiques linguistiques éducatives doivent être comprises comme des processus dynamiques fonctionnant à de multiples niveaux, et impliquant la participation de nombreux acteurs si leurs objectifs sont un apprentissage réussi et un développement durable du bilinguisme et du multilinguisme chez les élèves. Dans une dernière partie, l’article analyse deux exemples de politiques linguistiques en Europe, l’une pour la petite enfance au Luxembourg et l’autre pour l’école primaire en Irlande, afin d’illustrer comment créer et mettre en oeuvre des politiques linguistiques éducatives visant une éducation multilingue pour tous. Nous espérons que cet article trouvera un écho auprès d’auteurs de politiques linguistiques éducatives, de chercheurs, d’enseignants et de différents acteurs concernés par les développements et les défis liés aux politiques linguistiques éducatives en Europe.",0,1
"This work presents initial data from Avaipa, a previously undocumented language of central Bougainville. In the sparse literature that exists on this variety, it is anecdotally described as a mixed language. It will be demonstrated that the perception of language mixing is due to lexical borrowing, both from Papuan and from Oceanic sources, though a large-scale lexical comparison suggests a significant connection to the South Bougainville group. A tentative classification of Avaipa as a Papuan language is offered, where the language can be shown to be most closely related to the South Bougainville group, but because of the presence of certain lexical and structural features, the possibility is raised whereby Avaipa serves as a bridge to the North Bougainville group.",0,1

"This article takes the plurilingual repertoires of foreign language teachers – and thus the teachers’ linguistic diversity – as a starting point for exploratory research into the potential of visual methods in teacher education for changing mind-sets. Describing and reflecting on the ubiquitous manifestation of a monolingual habitus in foreign language (teacher) education, we consider ways to offer linguistically responsive foreign language teacher education aiming at challenging that ethos. Reporting on a project based on the production of drawings, we present and compare the linguistic biographies of future French and Spanish teachers, using multimodal analysis. The analysis seeks to uncover whether target language (French and Spanish) and migrant background influence the visual representation of the plurilingual repertoire and of the process of becoming plurilingual. As no significant differences are observed, demonstrating the pervasiveness of the monolingual mind-set in foreign language learning and teacher education, I propose some ways forward in response to the identified language learning ideologies.",0,1

"This article reports on the progress (or lack thereof) regarding the use of Sesotho as an official medium of communication in selected government departments in the Free State Provincial Government (FSPG). In South Africa, provincial governments are required to implement language policies that promote multilingualism. The aim is to develop previously marginalised languages such as Sesotho, isiXhosa and isiZulu, among others, so that they have equal status to English and Afrikaans. A mixed-method design was used to guide the research process and purposive sampling to ensure that participants made a valuable contribution to this study. We are concerned that despite efforts being made to reduce the gap between official languages such as English and Afrikaans and the previously marginalised languages, there is no real progress in this regard. The results of this study reveal that Sesotho, as a previously marginalised language, is still underutilised in government departments. Evidence suggests that the results of this study be used as a guide for the formulation and implementation of language policies and procedures to address this problem.",0,1
"Zusammenfassung Die Verbreitung der indogermanischen Sprachen wird häufig auf die Ausbreitung der Kultur (Urkultur) einer konkreten Menschengruppe, der Indogermanen, aus einer Urheimat (Primärheimat) zurückgeführt. Nach Ansicht des Autors ist es nicht möglich, eine solche Urkultur zu ermitteln und in Raum und Zeit festzulegen. Die beliebten Migrationshypothesen entfallen aus sachlichen Gründen; ein Erklärungsmodell von B. Schlerath läßt sich archäologisch ebenfalls nicht verifizieren. Auf der Suche nach Alternativmodellen werden die Konzeptionen von W. P. Schmid und J. Udolph, N. S. Trubetzkoy und K. Wiik erörtert. Sie kommen ohne Migrationsmodelle aus und stehen nicht im Widerspruch zu den anthropologischen und archäologischen Befunden. Bei Akzeptanz einer von J. Robb vorgenommenen Computersimulation lassen sich die genannten Vorstellungen (mit Ausnahme der Trubetzkoy-Konzeption) weitgehend miteinander kombinieren. In einem Anhang wird auf einige Hypothesen von Th. Vennemann über die alten Kulturverhältnisse im nördlichen Mitteleuropa und deren sprachlichen Auswirkungen eingegangen.",0,1

"Recently, a generalized multi-microphone noise reduction scheme, referred to as the spatially pre-processed speech distortion weighted multichannel Wiener filter (SP-SDW-MWF), has been presented. This scheme consists of a fixed spatial pre-processor and a multichannel adaptive noise canceler (ANC) optimizing the SDW-MWF cost function. By taking speech distortion explicitly into account in the design criterion of the multichannel ANC, the SP-SDW-MWF adds robustness to the standard generalized sidelobe canceler (GSC). In this paper, we present a multichannel frequency-domain criterion for the SDW-MWF, from which several – existing and novel – adaptive frequency-domain algorithms can be derived. The main difference between these adaptive algorithms consists in the calculation of the step size matrix (constrained vs. unconstrained, block-structured vs. diagonal) used in the update formula for the multichannel adaptive filter. We investigate the noise reduction performance, the robustness and the tracking performance of these adaptive algorithms, using a perfect voice activity detection (VAD) mechanism and using an energy-based VAD. Using experimental results with a small-sized microphone array in a hearing aid, it is shown that the SP-SDW-MWF is more robust against signal model errors than the GSC, and that the block-structured step size matrix gives rise to a faster convergence and a better tracking performance than the diagonal step size matrix, only at a slightly higher computational cost.",0,1
"Johan Liljencrants was a KTH oldtimer. His interests focused early on speech analysis and synthesis where in the 1960s he took a leading part in the development of analysis hardware, the OVE III speech synthesizer, and the introduction of computers in the Speech Transmission Laboratory. Later work shifted toward general speech signal processing, for instance in his thesis on the use of a reflection line synthesizer. His interests expanded to modelling the glottal system, parametrically as in the Liljencrants–Fant (LF) model of glottal waveshapes, as well as physically including glottal aerodynamics and mechanics.",0,1
"In this article, I explore the semiotics of print dictionaries for Gallo, a minority Romance language of Brittany, France. Although dictionaries are generally understood as authoritative representations of semantic content, I show how the materiality of dictionaries was central to their embedding in Gallo advocacy and art. Drawing on performance and interactional data collected during twelve months of ethnographic fieldwork, I explore how advocates and performers at language festivals displayed dictionaries as icons of Gallo's existence and “weight” and indexes of Gallo's complementarity with modern life. Rather than enforcing a standard, dictionaries prompted display of local, heterogeneous linguistic expertise.",0,1
"BOOK NOTICES 233 simple sentences and then the structure of complex sentences. Next it progresses to a consideration of constituent word order followed by coordination and subordination. Finally, there is a detailed consideration of words and word groups based on each of the major word classes: verbals, nomináis, pronominals, adjectivals, and adverbals. ME aims to present a pedagogically-sound treatment of grammar without adhering to any particular theoretical viewpoint. Although the goal is to keep the analysis straightforward, there is no attempt to hide weaknesses, and indeed alternative analyses are regularly considered. For example, while a flat treestructure is presented so that all the immediate constituents of a sentence (such as subject, predicator, objects, and adverbials) are shown on the same level, branching directly out ofthe top-level sentence node, there is a detailed discussion of problems with this structure, such as how to handle the coordination of predicates. Indeed, one of the commonest (and most welcome) conclusions is that there are no easy answers , as 'language is at times very elusive' (91) and frequently a 'grey zone' (300, 359) exists between one analysis and another. The material has obviously been prepared with great care, and it is presented exceptionally clearly. The example sentences, many of which are taken from real texts, are always appropnate. There arejust occasional archaic forms, such as 'jenny-ass' as a female donkey (355) and 'next' as one possible superlative form of 'near' (476); and do 'the Indonese' people (485) really exist? But on the whole, the analysis is highly dependable and reveals the solid scholarship of the authors and their comprehensive understanding of the grammar of English. Despite the clarity of the presentation, there are two potential problems with the use of this book as a grammar text for university students. The first is that some terms are used without an adequate explanation . For example, the concept of inflections, which is surely absolutely essential to any study of grammar, is only given a perfunctory explanation (14); the term 'complement' is used (29) well before it is given a proper explanation; and reference to 'orthographical units' ( 17) is made without any explanation at all. The second problem is the sheer length of the text. One could, of course, try to use just some of the chapters; but such basic concepts as subjectpredicator concord (239) and the count/mass distinction for nouns (357) are not handled till quite late in the book, and it might prove hard to select some of the text while skipping over the rest. ME does not include any exercises, presumably because these are provided by the workbook, which is written by a separate author (Klinge). These exercises are fairly useful, though it is pity that there is no key. K states in the introduction that a key might 'discourage fruitful discussion'; but in some cases, though K obviously has a fixed idea about what is intended, it is not entirely clear what this is. Furthermore , a key would be interesting as it would show us how anybody could possibly draw a structural tree for some of the sentences that can be up to 30 words long (158)! One final point about the exercises is that many of the sentences are derived from rather dense legal texts, which presumably reflects one of the research interests of the author but does not seem entirely appropriate in a student's grammar of English. In fact, exercises are only a small part of the workbook , the vast majority of which consists of further text where K believes that ME needs further elaboration . Surprisingly, K often disagrees with the analysis of ME, so we are told that ME uses 'sleight of hand' (58) and 'forces us to interpret' (25) things in a way that 'is highly questionable' (122), and there are instances where the analysis 'is a bit odd' (140). While additional discussion about grammatical analysis can always be regarded as healthy, and certainly K's discussion is interesting and thoughtful, it is somewhat alarming to find so much criticism of ME in its own workbook. Surely what such a long text as ME really needs is a greater range of exercises (preferably with a...",0,1

"Research finds that going far from home has many positive psychological outcomes such as enhanced creative thinking, and research on creativity reveals that nonconformity can be a useful tool to stimulate innovation. Merging these findings, we theorise that foreign experiences increase nonconformist attitudes and behaviours. In Studies 1 and 2, surveys of Chinese university students and non-student adults consistently showed that multicultural experiences were negatively related to conformity tendencies. Study 3 found that American students who were studying in China demonstrated a lower conformity tendency than American students without multicultural experiences, which suggests that the multicultural experience – conformity link cannot be accounted for by the effects of culture. Results from Study 4 indicated that compared with participants who had planned to go abroad but had not left their home country yet, participants who had lived abroad reported lower levels of conformity. Lastly, experimentally manipulating a focus on foreign experiences (vs. home experiences) facilitates non-conforming ways of thinking in terms of product preference (Study 5). Together, these findings provide evidence that exposure to diverse cultures not only produces divergent psychological consequences as have been found by other researchers, but also leads to the emergence of nonconformity attitudes and behaviours.",0,1
"ABSTRACT This study investigates the effects of input modification on L2 Korean reading comprehension. A total of 160 participants were randomly assigned to one of five conditions: baseline (B), simplified (SP), lexically elaborated (LE), structurally elaborated (SE), or lexically and structurally elaborated (LSE) version of texts. Comprehension was assessed by a multiple-choice test with three question types: synthesis, replication, and inference. In addition, a questionnaire for perceptive comprehension was administered. The test data were analyzed by a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a least significant difference (LSD) test. The results were as follows: (a) simplified input promoted Korean as a second language students' reading comprehension, although the results were not statistically significant; (b) elaborated input enhanced the reading comprehension with degrees of difference among elaboration types; (c) the effects of simplification were not significantly different from those of elaboration; (d) different text modification types assisted students' degree of comprehension processing differently measured by the scores of reading comprehension on different question types; (e) students' perceived comprehension was well reflected on their scores of reading comprehension. The perceived comprehension of all the modification type groups (LSE, SE, LE, and SP) was significantly higher than those of the B version group.",0,1
"The Bluest Eye, by Toni Morrison, recounts the story of Pecola Breedlove, an eleven-year-old Black girl in Lorain, Ohio, where her wish for blue eyes represents desire for what she is denied, the privileges of her white classmates and the comforts of a safe home. Amid this novel set in 1941 during the Great Migration, a place name-based analysis reveals a literary landscape of racism in the mid-20th-century US, from the Jim Crow South to the industrial North. A toponymic study reveals how Morrison uses place names as stylistic devices in two ways. In the narrative present, she deploys them as opening frames for immediate lessons in racial behaviors for the children who are her main characters; in the narrative past, he uses them to recall distant locations from adult characters' histories to suggest ways in which racism persists across space and time. In combination, Morrison's application of toponymy and setting casts Lorain as microcosm of the nation and implicates all its citizens in the racist ideology that destroys Pecola and her family.",0,1
"This study aims to explore types of motivation for smartphone dictionary use among Chinese university EFL learners. It is a mixed-method inquiry carried out under the frameworks of the Function Theory of Lexicography (Tarp 2007) and the Strategy Inventory for Dictionary Use (Gavriilidou 2013). Twenty-two semi-structured interviews were conducted, followed by a confirmatory survey (N=577). The interview data revealed ten themes of user strategies and purposes. Using a latent class analytical tool, Mplus, we identified from the survey a model with three user classes: Customisation (33.3%), Learning (51.9%) and Utility (14.8%). They respectively imply individuating use of dictionary features and automatic messaging, authentic English language learning, and utilitarian purposes like passing exams. In addition, three variables were used for predicting class membership, namely gender (male and female), English proficiency (high and low), and university type (key and non-key). Multinomial logistic regressions showed motivation tendencies among these demographic groups: male users or non-key university students were more likely to fall into the Customisation class; high-proficiency learners or key university students, Learning; and female users or low-proficiency learners, Utility. In sum, this research has furthered our understanding of motivation for second language learning through mobile technology applications. It has theoretical, methodological and practical implications for future studies, offering fresh insights into e-dictionary customisation and education in e-dictionary use.",0,1

"1.1. The first true linguistic typologist – recognisable as a predecessor by the likes of ourselves, now publishing in journals like Linguistic Typology – was Giovanni Domenico Campanella (1568–1639). A Dominican friar from Calabria (Fra Tommaso by monastic name) who was to rise to lasting fame as a utopian social thinker with his La città del sole, Campanella was a philosopher in the wide and colourful Renaissance sense. As was the standard repertoire, his Philosophia realis (1623) covered Physiologia, Ethica, Politica, and Oeconomica, and his Philosophia rationalis (1638) continued with Dialectica, Grammatica, Rhetorica, Poetica, and Historiographia; but, with labour not yet divided between scholar and wizard, Campanella also distinguished himself as a seeker of arcaner truths.",0,1
"Although Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s eloquence as a speaker is widely recognized and his rhetorical strategies have been extensively studied, no analyses have been conducted on his language variation in different speech settings. This article examines a set of variable structures in King's speech to determine how it indexes his regional, social, and ethnic identity as he accommodated different audiences and interactions. The use of unstressed (ING), medial and final /t/ release, postvocalic nonrhoticity, coda-final cluster reduction, copula/auxiliary absence, the vowel system, and syllable timing are considered for four different speech events: the “I Have a Dream” speech (1963), the Nobel Prize acceptance speech (1964), a conversation with talk-show host Merv Griffin (1967), and the “I've Been to the Mountaintop” speech (1968). The analysis indicates stability across speech events for some variables and significant variation for others based on the speech event. His indexical profile indicates that he consistently embodied his Southern-based, African American preacherly stance while fluidly shifting features that indexed performance and formality based on audience, interaction, and intentional purpose. His language embraced ethnolinguistic tradition and transcended linguistic diversity, modeling linguistic equality in practice.",0,1
"Pragmatics lies at the point where language meets the social world and encompasses both the linguistic and the social dimensions of communication. However, the relationship between pragmatic abilities, other language skills, and socio-cognitive aspects such as mentalizing is still a matter of wide debate. This study sets out to investigate the status of pragmatic abilities by testing from a developmental angle their relationship with other linguistic skills and mentalizing. We examined the role of structural language and mentalizing on both expressive pragmatic and prosodic skills in typically developing preschool children. A total of 105 3-to 4-year-old children were assessed on pragmatics and prosody with the Audiovisual Pragmatic Test, as well as on structural language skills (vocabulary and syntax) and a series of mentalizing measures (false belief, emotion understanding, and metacognitive vocabulary). A combined approach including correlations, regressions, and structural equation modeling (SEM) was used. Structural language was a strong positive predictor of both pragmatic and prosodic scores, while mentalizing predicted neither pragmatic nor prosodic performance. We suggest that in preschool years, expressive pragmatics and prosodic skills are more closely related to structural language skills than to mentalizing.",0,1
"WHEN SOUNDS GO WILD: PHONOLOGICAL CHANGE AND SYNTACTIC RE-ANALYSIS IN HAVASUPAI Leanne Hinton University of California, Berkeley A cross-generational study of speech in Havasupai, a Yuman language of Arizona, reveals a set of variable phonological rules, affecting person-agreement affixes, that have begun to operate in the last hundred years. These rules might seem obligatory for younger speakers; but closer investigation reveals that these speakers have instead re-analysed the paradigm. This re-analysis illustrates the principle that rules which do not allow surface evidence of the underlying form to be preserved cannot exist: obligatory application of such a rule must eliminate both the rule itself and the underlying form. The speech of the youngest children shows continuing change of the paradigm toward an internally-consistent, transparent system of person-agreement that differs radically from the original system.* This is a micro-study of linguistic change in a small American Indian community . There are only about 500 Havasupais, living together in a village situated in a tributary ofthe Grand Canyon; but all, including the children, speak Havasupai (a language ofthe Yuman family) as their first language. Thus the language thrives; yet, during the past hundred years, it has been undergoing some radical changes. This paper is a study of change in one small facet of the language. The changes discussed here are based on phonological processes that have been in operation since Proto-Yuman times. But I will demonstrate that, in this case, these processes have been freed from earlier morphological constraints, and have resulted in syntactic changes unprecedented in Yuman language history. 1. Theoretical framework: Assumptions and assertions. Essential to this paper is the variable model, as developed and expanded by Labov, the Sankoffs, Cedergren and others..1 The view of language used here is one which is basic to both generative theory and variation theory. It can be summarized as follows. Each individual develops his own internal model of his native language, based partly on his own continuous and largely unconscious efforts to impose patterns on the linguistic input he receives from other speakers. There is no theoretical necessity that any two speakers have precisely the same internal model of their language. Each individual probably develops a partially unique set of linguistic processes. Thus Havasupai—or any language—might be defined as a set of mutually intelligible idiolects spoken by a group of interacting people. Language change has * Many people have been helpful to me in the writing of this paper. I am especially grateful to William Bright, Paul Kay, William Labov, Margaret Langdon, Pamela Munro, and Karl Zimmer for their extremely valuable comments. Thanks also to Werner Winter, whose comments to me once, on some oddities of Hualapai and Havasupai verb phrases, stimulated the investigations that resulted in this paper. The greatest thanks, however, must go to members of the Havasupai tribe for their help and continuing tolerance of my research. To Gary Scott, I am grateful for emotional support and for help in preparing the manuscript. 1 Seminal papers include Labov 1969, 1971, Cedergren 1973, G. Sankoff 1974, and Cedergren & D. Sankoff 1974. 320 WHEN SOUNDS GO WILD321 occurred when the utterances of some members ofthat community have characteristics demonstrably different from those in utterances of previous generations. By observing the idiolects of living speakers of Havasupai, and by comparing these idiolects according to the ages of the different speakers, we can observe language change in progress. The cross-generational survey of Havasupai personmarking on verbs which was carried out for this study revealed a set ofphonological rules that are variable for older speakers, and that appear to have become completely obligatory—i.e., they apply at a level of 1007o—for younger speakers. However, certain interesting aspects of the situation indicate that we are not witnessing obligatory synchronic rules at all in the younger speakers: instead, we see the results of the development of new underlying forms. To generalize from these findings, it can be pointed out that the maintenance of underlying forms that differ from surface forms is dependent on the continued existence of clear alternations: either clear social or stylistic variability, or the maintenance of different forms in different environments.2 But...",0,1

In the second part, we show that polysemy is not a stable phenomenon and relations between senses may differ across language users. For instance, our fifty-fifty class or borderline cases may be represented differently by different language users depending on their perception of the world, world knowledge, associations.

"Editorial Introduction This special issue of The Canadian Modern Language Review offers a collection of articles representing national initiatives in second language (L2) reading. The call for papers stated that the issue would explore new directions in reading research, specifically reading as a social and cultural event, the effects of on-screen reading, and pedagogical applications. Although at first glance these articles seem to reflect more traditional reading concerns such as testing, models of text comprehension, comprehension monitoring, and fluency, a closer look reveals new directions. A whole language or top-down ideology has dominated L2 reading research since it began in the 1970s (Been, 1979; Clarke & Silberstein, 1979; Coady, 1979). This top-down ideology is a rather complex body of interrelated concepts, opinions, and assumptions, reflecting a view of reading in which cognitive processing (higher-level) strategies help the reader to construct meaning for large chunks of text. Using these higher-level strategies, the reader, who has acquired or learned them, makes predictions about what the text is going to be and inferences and decisions about the text. More recently, this whole language ideology ""purports that what people learn when they learn a language is not separate parts (words, sounds, sentences) but a supersystem of social practices whose conventions and systematicity both constrain and liberate"" (Edelsky, 1993, p. 548). Scollon's work (1998) investigating reading as social interaction lies within a whole language ideology, as does the work of Bloome (1993). Other current work in L2 reading (Abersold & Field, 1997; Day & Bamford, 1998, p. 93) still reflects maximum support for readers' higher-level processing to supplement language deficiencies at a lower level. More recently, however, this whole language ideology has been characterized as incomplete in that it emphasizes higher-level cognitive processing strategies such as inferencing, prediction, problem solving, and constructing meaning in order to form the reader's interpretation of a text while at the same time de-emphasizing lower-level language [End Page 1] processing strategies such as chunking into phrases, accessing word meaning, word identification, and letter recognition in order to construct the reader's text base. Until recently, research interest in lower-level processing strategies has lagged somewhat behind interest in higher-level processing strategies. But the gap is closing, as is evident in the work of Baddeley, Gathercole, and Papagno (1998), Chikamatsu (1996), Geva, (1999), Koda (1996, 2000), Muljani, Koda, and Moates (1998), Osburne and Mulling (2001), and Schmitt and Meara (1997), among others. Several of the articles in this special issue document the greater attention being paid to linguistic or lower-level processing strategies in L2 reading. The articles in this issue In a timely and important cross-linguistic study, MacCoubrey, Wade-Woolley, Klinger, and Kirby examine those measures which best identify English-speaking French immersion students at risk of future reading difficulties in both French and English. Of particular note is that these measures fall within lower-level or linguistic processing strategies, to wit: phonological awareness, phonological working memory, and the speed of lexical access. Through the use of these measures, the authors clearly indicate, young children at risk of future reading difficulties can be identified before they learn to read in their L2. Given the number of children in immersion programs, this identification is of major concern, and early identification of such at-risk readers (Stanovich, 1986) could help in preventing unfortunate situations in subsequent schooling. In the second article on testing, a cross-study investigation, Bayliss and Raymond focus on university-level ESL and FSL students' reading comprehension scores, which are seen to be the best overall predictors of their academic success (GPA). From both ESL and FSL studies, the authors demonstrate that reading proficiency plays a role in determining GPA and urge that more weight be given to L2 reading skills within specific university programs. With ever-increasing numbers of international students entering Canadian universities, some of whom may be initially disadvantaged in terms of the literacy demands of a...",0,1
"THE ALLIANCE between US President George W. Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair during the recent Second Gulf War has appeared anomalous to many, because they belong to ideologically very different political parties. Blair, in particular, has been accused of having betrayed some of the left-wing ideas that, historically, have characterised the Labour Party. This article seeks to understand the extent to which, at least in linguistic terms, the ideas of Blair and Bush may not be as alike as one might be tempted to believe. Two small corpora of interviews and speeches were collected over a period of some six weeks, all relating to the war in Iraq. Analysis of the corpora reveals some notable differences between Blair and Bush and also shows that certain important – and more hidden – elements of discourse escape this type of investigation and need closer scrutiny.",0,1
"This article focuses on the problems, and advantages and disadvantages of the bilingual dictionary from both the lexicographer's and the translator's point of view, with specific reference to bilingual Zulu dictionaries. It is shown that there are many and varying problems the lexicographer has to deal with and take cognisance of when compiling a translation dictionary. Of these, the main problem is the basic lack of equivalence or anisomorphism which exists between languages. This non-equivalence between languages is also the root cause of the difficulties with which the translator or user of the bilingual dictionary has to contend. The problems experienced by translators therefore overlap to a great extent with those which the lexicographer experiences in compiling a bilingual dictionary. It is concluded that the user of a bilingual dictionary should not only know what to expect to find in a translation dictionary, but must also treat such a dictionary with caution and discernment. It is also shown that there are clear criteria which the lexicographer can follow in compiling a bilingual dictionary, which would then enable the user (and in particular the translator as user) to disambiguate the recorded information successfully.

"Abstract In this paper, we detail a method of introducing linguistics to elementary school students through a day camp model. Our day camps, Little Linguists, teach children about language analysis and exploration through a variety of activities, games, and crafts. The goals of these camps include enriching children's experience with language science, increasing university students' opportunities to share their linguistic knowledge with the community, and improving recruitment efforts for research studies. We discuss three related benefits of our camps: exposing children to linguistics at an early age, allowing undergraduate linguists a chance to “learn by teaching,” and giving researchers the opportunity to engage with the broader community. Survey data from families and undergraduate students involved with the camps support our own impressions of camp outcomes and benefits.",0,1

"A l'origine de ce travail, un double constat : d'une part l'importance accordee dans les romans de Claude Simon a la perception au sens large, c'est-a-dire incluant souvenir et imagination ; d'autre part une syntaxe qui ne se laisse pas decrire au moyen du modele traditionnel de la phrase. Pour analyser l'ecriture de la perception, nous avons procede en deux temps. La premiere partie est linguistique. Elle se propose d'abord de determiner le statut de la phrase comme fait grammatical et comme theme, avant de lui substituer un autre modele adapte des theories macro-syntaxiques et de leurs deux unites principales : la clause (unite de predication) et la periode (unite phenomenale). La seconde partie est stylistique. A partir du modele syntaxique defini, elle s'attache a commenter la representation de la perception en tant qu'acte chez Simon, d'abord a l'echelle de la clause en examinant l'ordre de ses constituants, ensuite dans la dynamique des relations inter-clausales. Cette double approche met en evidence le travail de decantation par l'ecriture des differentes phases de l'acte perceptif (sensation, reconnaissance, identification), ainsi que l'effort aussi obsessionnel que vain de combler les lacunes de la perception, par essence incomplete.",0,1
"Abstract A complete study of numeral syntax in Classical Sanskrit has yet to be written. Grammars provide concise, decontextualised surveys which mainly focus on the morphology of cardinal numerals. Given their textual genre, reference grammars can neither devote much space to this very topic nor give exhaustive data; very little is said about Sanskrit numeral constructions outside of this kind of resources. By combining modern linguistic frameworks and philological analysis, the following investigation is offered as a first step toward addressing this desideratum. The present analysis provides a novel approach to understand the semantics of numerals and shed some light on Sanskrit numeral syntax and the morphosyntactic properties of cardinal numerals. This research is organised as follows: I first provide a brief overview of some key features of Sanskrit numeral series and then propose a theoretical framework to conceptualise the main components of numeral systems; section 3 explores the lexicon‐prosody interface and is followed by an analysis of Sanskrit numeral constructions. Textual evidence of cardinal numerals from medieval Sanskrit mathematical works is investigated in detail. The linguistic framework employed by von Mengden (2010) to examine cardinal numerals in Old English has been particularly fruitful in the present study. I demonstrate that, unlike most other languages, Sanskrit makes extensive use of non‐systemic expressions of cardinality and that authors employ and combine a great variety of numeral constructions.",0,1
"The present paper explores Φ-agreement patterns between C0 ʔinn ‘that’ and the local subject in eight Arabic dialects. Four distinct patterns of Φ-agreement are identified. In Pattern I dialects, C0 displays obligatory Φ-agreement with a pro subject but optional Φ-agreement with the non-pro subject. In Pattern II dialects, C0 shows obligatory Φ-agreement with a pro subject but no Φ-agreement with the non-pro subject. In Pattern III dialects, C0 shows optional Φ-agreement with a pro subject but no Φ-agreement with the non-pro subject. Finally, in Pattern IV dialects, C0 displays no Φ-agreement with the pro- or non-pro subjects. To account for these asymmetrical patterns of complementizer agreement (or lack thereof), we propose that C0 ʔinn always merges under Fin0 (where it acts as a probe (cf. Chomsky, 2000)) and afterward moves to Force0 to check the Force feature. Additionally, we show that these four patterns arise due to the interaction of two underlying factors: the Φ-content of C0 (i.e., Fin0, whether C0 is endowed with unvalued Φ-content or not) and the structural position and nature of the subject (e.g., whether it is a lexical subject, referential pro, or expletive pro).",0,1
"Research on second-language (L2) acquisition has identified linguistic domains that appear to be especially difficult to learn—one such sticking point being syntactic structures that depend on the surrounding discourse. The Interface Hypothesis (IH) explains what makes such constructions problematic by appealing to a modular view of language, arguing that integrating knowledge from language-internal domains (e.g., syntax) with language-external domains (e.g., discourse) overwhelms the finite processing resources of L2 learners, especially when integration happens in real time. We test the IH with a syntax-discourse interface phenomenon in Spanish: information focus. The facts about information focus in L1 and L2 Spanish have been enthusiastically debated, but what is missing from these debates is evidence that directly indexes processing, which is essential to evaluate the IH. We use an off-line forced-choice judgment task and an online self-paced reading task to provide a new source of evidence of L2 acquisition of Spanish focus. We find that L1-English/L2-Spanish learners largely resemble L1-Spanish natives in both their judgments and their processing of focus, contrary to the predictions of the IH.",0,1

"Legislatures enact laws and the courts interpret them. Under the doctrine of legislative supremacy, a judge is not free to ignore or modify a statutory provision in order to substitute a rule that seems to him to be better reasoned; thus where the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, interpretation is unnecessary and it must be enforced according to its terms. Nevertheless, gaps and ambiguities can arise and, in such cases, courts apply interpretive rules, or ‘canons of construction’, to resolve these ambiguities. One frequently invoked rule requires that words that are not defined by a statute be given their ordinary meaning by the interpreting court. In recent years, the United States Supreme Court has increasingly relied upon dictionary definitions in applying this rule. The Court’s use of dictionaries as authority for its interpretations incorporates the assumption that the dictionary is the best source for ascertaining the meaning of statutory texts. This article challenges that assumption on linguistic grounds. I argue that the focus on definitions skews the interpretation of statutory language by isolating words from their semantic context. By comparing two cases in which the Court used dictionary definitions to a third case in which the definition used by the Court was contained in the statute itself, I demonstrate that the ordinary meaning of legal terms cannot be determined by dictionary definitions.",0,1
"Abstract In medical consultations, disagreements may arise. Yet, patients’ predisposition to engage in a discussion with their doctors to resolve these disagreements may vary. This study aims to develop and validate a measurement tool to assess patient argumentativeness ( P-ARG ) in general practice. Starting from the pragma-dialectical theory of argumentation and Infante and Rancer’s (1982) argumentativeness scale, scale items were developed and subsequently administered to 183 participants. Principal component analysis was conducted to explore the scale structure. Also, convergent and concurrent validity were assessed. The results confirmed a two-factor scale structure and provided preliminary support for its validity. While further refinement is required, the (preliminary) P-ARG scale can be used for research purposes by medical argumentation as well as health communication scholars, e.g., to explore the relationships between doctors’ provision of argumentation, patients’ perspectives thereof, and patient argumentativeness.",0,1

However, corpus analysis reveals significant differences. In particular, French population is used in affective and political contexts, unlike its English counterpart, which has a predominantly demographic use; as for the other pair, plus ou moins has a euphemistic use which more or less does not share. The study concludes by proposing modifications in the methodology of bilingual lexicography to address such non‐equivalences, which become apparent through contrastive corpus analysis.",0,1

"De nombreux linguistes ont distingue un ensemble de verbes «faibles » en lui donnant des denominations variees: verbes parenthetiques, verbes epistemiques faibles, verbes evidentiels. Ces verbes se distinguent sur le plan syntaxique par un comportement specifique de rection faible (suivis d'une que P ou employes en incise) et sur le plan semantique par leur valeur modale epistemique, souvent decrite comme «faible » par rapport a un comportement semantiquement plus fort que ces memes verbes presenteraient dans d'autres structures. Cet ensemble de verbes (tres frequemment utilises en francais parle) n'est pas aise a definir, ni a delimiter. Notre contribution presente une analyse de trois de ces verbes en francais parle, sous leur forme la plus frequemment attestee, a la premiere personne: je crois, je pense et je trouve. L'analyse a permis (1) de degager trois realisations syntaxiques «faibles » qui sont en distribution complementaire et qui permettent de definir un ensemble de verbes ou plutot un comportement de verbe « faible »; (2) contrairement a d'autres analyses proposees, nous ne pensons pas que dans leur emploi faible ces verbes perdent toute capacite de selectionner des complements, ni qu'ils passent de la categorie du verbe a une autre categorie, celle de l'adverbe en l'occurrence; (3) sur le plan semantique, ces verbes presentent une valeur semantique stable qui porte sur la validation du contenu de l'enonce P: ce contenu est presente comme ayant un degre moindre de validation; (4) a cote de cette valeur « structurale » globale, chaque verbe presente des specificites semantiques et selectionne des contenus particuliers. En cela la classe des verbes faibles ne s'oppose pas essentiellement aux autres classes semantico-syntaxiques de verbes.",0,1
"This study takes a corpus-based approach to investigating ongoing change in the Australian English adjective amplifier system based on the Australian component of the International Corpus of English (ICE). The paper analyzes changes in amplifiers across apparent time, with special attention being placed on amplifier–adjective–bigram frequencies, to provide insights into cognitive mechanisms underlying lexical replacement. Specifically, the paper analyzes why the innovative variant really was successful in replacing the traditional amplifier very, while other rivals (e.g. so or pretty) were not. Lexical diversity scores and distinctive collexeme analyses confirm that, in contrast to other rival variants, really specializes on and collocates with a few high-frequency adjectives (HFAs) while being dispreferred by low frequency adjectives. The results of a mixed-effects regression analysis show that the use of really is socially stratified with young speakers preferring really over other variants. In addition, the multivariate analysis shows that the replacement of very by really is a female-dominated change and that the use of really is enhanced by priming. The paper argues that collocating with HFAs leads to deeper entrenchment which, in turn, serves as an advantage in situations where speakers choose between rivalling innovative variants.",0,1
"The present article—in four parts, of which this is the final installment—is a history of the Dictionary Society of North America (DSNA) in its infancy and youth, and thus also a chapter in the history of the language sciences more generally, as well as a contribution to the sociology of organizations. Whereas the first three installments described the founding of DSNA, its leadership, and its membership during the society's early years, respectively, this installment focuses on its conferences and publications. DSNA originated in conferences of the early 1970s, and biennial conferences became central to DSNA's intellectual and social activity from 1977 throughout DSNA's history. Although it struggled to organize a publications program early on, the DSNA Newsletter has appeared twice annually since 1977, and the inaugural issue of the society's journal, Dictionaries, appeared in 1979. For a while, alongside these typical learned-society organs some of DSNA's leaders hoped to establish series of conference proceedings and monographs, but there performance, if not ambition, faltered. The newsletter and journal continue to thrive, but in those early years they faced challenges. This installment of the history explains how those challenges were resolved into what became the public identity of DSNA and celebrates the success of the scholarly activities in the society's early period—conferences, the newsletter, and the journal are all thriving today, and not by historical accident.",0,1

"The recent history of English language dictionary boycotts, petitions, and protests evidences how public expectations and demands of dictionaries shape lexicographical history and praxis. Widely publicized campaigns by the NAACP, feminist organizations, ethnic groups, and subcultural caucuses have accused mainstream dictionaries of endorsing damaging social stereotypes. In addition to demanding audits of dictionary-maker demographics, such boycotts have advocated revision strategies beyond or at odds with established lexicographical methods. While boycotts have often successfully secured lexicographical change, that change has been limited in scope. Accordingly, this paper suggests that, to be more publicly accountable and socially responsible, dictionaries need read public protests as mandates to cultivate a more ethical, reflexive, and relational mode of lexicographical praxis.

"Reviewed by: English: The language of the Vikings by Joseph Embley Emonds and Jan Terje Faarlund David W. Lightfoot English: The language of the Vikings. By Joseph Embley Emonds and Jan Terje Faarlund. (Olomouc modern language monographs 3.) Olomouc: Palacký University, 2014. Pp. 180. ISBN 9788024443829. English has horrendous orthography, an extremely complicated inventory of vowels, a few hundred irregular verbs, a huge vocabulary, and other features that make it ill-equipped to be a global language used by millions of people who must learn it in adulthood (Pullum 2015). This results to some degree from the fact that English is a global language in a different sense, one that has been shaped in part by much population movement, both of different populations moving into England in ancient times and, more recently, of English speakers taking their language into many parts of the world in what is referred to euphemistically as ‘language contact’, often a brutal process serving to suppress and replace the indigenous languages of the colonized. At different stages of history England was dominated by invaders: British, migrants from all over the Roman Empire, Celts, Anglo-Saxons in the sixth century, Scandinavians in the ninth and tenth [End Page 474] centuries, and Norman French in the eleventh, all of whom left an imprint on the language of the residents. In modern times the language has absorbed words from the many languages encountered in the process of colonization. All of this, of course, has contributed to the multiplicity of vocabulary, different words from different roots with similar or even identical meanings. Nonetheless, the standard textbook view is that English is some kind of ‘gradual and imperceptibly changing object which smoothly floats through time and space’ (Kiparsky 1968:175), changing from Old to Middle to Early Modern and then to present-day English, with various gradations in between but no major disruptions. The early generativists dealing with change, by contrast, saw abstract grammars changing as children encountered new ambient language. Kiparsky went on: ‘the transmission of language is discontinuous, and a language is recreated by each child on the basis of the speech data it hears’ (see Lightfoot 2016). There may be new phenomena that trigger a single change at the abstract level, yielding a new structure that serves to generate many new phenomena that enter the language at the same time. This approach anticipated neo-Darwinian biologists’ rejection of Darwin’s gradualism and their appeal to punctuated equilibrium (Eldridge & Gould 1972), in turn based on Ernst Mayr’s model of geographic speciation. This led to a focus on structural shifts across many historical disciplines, some known as Thomian ‘catastrophes’ or phase transitions at different stages of investigation. Linguists also began identifying such saltations and understood them in terms of children acquiring new I-languages when exposed to new ambient language, such that the new E-language triggers new I-languages. Rich and deep explanations have been developed for some syntactic changes. Anybody who has examined early English knows that there was substantial influence from Norse, many have noted major differences between Old and Middle English, and some scholars have claimed that Middle English’s surprising properties result from a kind of creole status (Bailey & Maroldt 1977, Görlach 1986). Joseph Emonds, a distinguished theoretical syntactician, and Jan Terje Faarlund, a leading Scandinavianist, now offer a radical challenge to the philologists’ conception of English as progressing gradually and often imperceptibly from one stage to another. E&F postulate that so-called early Middle English, spoken and written in the East Midlands in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, represents a new language, which they call Anglicized Norse, having a Scandinavian syntax alongside words descended from Old English antecedents. They build on work by philologists and syntacticians who argued for analyses that E&F now construe as aspects of a more comprehensive phase transition, and they muster considerable evidence for their analysis (for example, Denison’s (1993:Ch. 9) work showing that Old English lacked subject raising). E&F tease apart syntactic characteristics of West Germanic (Dutch, Frisian, High and Low German, and their later offshoots Yiddish and Afrikaans) and North Germanic (Scandinavian), all well-analyzed...",0,1

"This article shows how emcees create local meanings of race and ethnicity in freestyle rap battles. We demonstrate how performers attach new social meanings to race and ethnicity in verbal duels, even as they also reproduce normative meanings around gender and sexuality. Further, we suggest that the construction of local, alternative meanings around race and ethnicity might actually help support dominant racial hierarchies by relegating “blackness” suitable for only a limited set of domains. Despite the enduring nature of these broader racial hierarchies, we conclude that performances are activities in which individuals contest and negotiate the social meanings of identities.

"Estonian offers several means for expressing narrow focus, including a choice between a syntactic strategy resulting in marked constituent order, and a prosodic strategy resulting in marked nuclear accent placement. The present study examines the usage of the different focus-marking strategies in spontaneous dialogues, with the primary aim of verifying the hypothesis that when either the syntactic or the prosodic strategy must be used, the prosodic strategy is preferred. The results show an overwhelming preference for keeping both the constituent order and the accent placement unmarked. In the relatively small number of cases where either the syntactic or the prosodic strategy must be chosen, a slight preference for the prosodic strategy can be observed. There also exists a minor strategy of focus fronting, whereby both the constituent order and the nuclear accent placement are marked; the role of this strategy requires further study.Kokkuvõte.

"This paper presents an analysis of linguistic data that stems from a task-oriented dialogue. We demonstrate that certain referring expressions used in this setting are potentially ambiguous and indeterminate but do not lead to referential errors such as under– or over–population of the discourse representation. Three studies are reported which show that it is the skilled use of non-linguistic constraints, present in the task which facilitates successful reference. When these non-linguistic constraints are removed, skilled speakers are able to make a compensatory adjustment in the precision of their referring expressions. The ability of people to make this compensatory adjustment is an aspect of referential skill not revealed by more traditional task–oriented assessments.",0,1
"This editorial provides an overview of some of the new horizons that are visible from the pragmatic framework of relevance theory. While its roots lie firmly in linguistic pragmatics, the influence of relevance theory has spread – indeed, continues to spread – to a range of disciplines, some of which might be said to lie beyond its original domain. As well as contributing to cognitive sciences such as developmental and evolutionary psychology and the emergent domain of experimental pragmatics – relevance theory was, after all, originally conceived as a model of communication and cognition – a growing number of researchers is bringing a relevance-theoretic perspective to work in: literary and artistic studies; anthropology, cross-cultural studies and the social sciences; and disciplines as diverse as affective science, internet-mediated discourse and clinical practice.",0,1

"A wave is a disturbance that travels in space and time. Mechanical waves can be transverse or longitudinal, but sound waves are always only longitudinal waves: the oscillation is along the propagation direction. What oscillates are the particles of the material through which sound propagates. For this reason, sound waves cannot propagate in vacuum as light does, they need a material to propagate through, such as air, water, walls, or rocks. Sound waves in air are produced when a string, a pipe, a tuning fork, a speaker membrane, or a vocal cord vibrate, and set the air in motion, so that air compression and rarefaction propagates away from the sound source. It is the compression and rarefaction wave that propagates, not the air itself, at a rate called the speed of sound in air, which is 344 m/s at 21 °C. This speed increases significantly with temperature, affecting the frequency of sound; thus, it is important to warm up all wind instruments, so the frequencies they produce are as expected by the manufacturer, the musician, and the listener.",0,1
"Animacy, commonly defined as the distinction between living and non-living entities, is a useful notion in cognitive science and linguistics employed to describe and predict variation in psychological and linguistic behaviour. In the (psycho)linguistics literature we find linguistic animacy dichotomies which are (implicitly) assumed to correspond to biological dichotomies. We argue this is problematic, as it leaves us without a cognitively grounded, universal description for non-prototypical cases. We show that ‘animacy’ in language can be better understood as universally emerging from a gradual, cognitive property by collecting animacy ratings for a great range of nouns from Japanese and Persian. We used these cognitive ratings in turn to predict linguistic variation in these languages traditionally explained through dichotomous distinctions. We show that whilst (speakers of) languages may subtly differ in their conceptualisation of animacy, universality may be found in the process of mapping conceptual animacy to linguistic variation.",0,1
A computationally efficient speech enhancement pipeline in noisy environments based on a single-processor implementation is developed for utilization in bilateral cochlear implant systems. A two-channel joint objective function is defined and a closed form solution is obtained based on the weighted-Euclidean distortion measure. The computational efficiency and no need for synchronization aspects of this pipeline make it a suitable solution for real-time deployment. A speech quality measure is used to show its effectiveness in six different noisy environments as compared to a similar one-channel enhancement pipeline when using two separate processors or when using independent sequential processing.,0,1

He also highlighted how conflicting metaphoric frames can impede the resolution of these situations. Supplementing Schön's ideas with Lakoff and Johnson's (1980) discussion of conceptual metaphors, I argue that the 1997 University of Manitoba Task Force on Strategic Planning's second report, Transformation: Continuity and Change, represents such a conflict in its inability to reconcile the metaphors ""UNIVERSITY AS BUSINESS"" and ""UNIVERSITY AS COMMUNITY."" This case study is particularly relevant at a time when the process of restructuring is going on in many institutions and organizations.",0,1
"The article examines the boom in visual poetry that took place in the second half of the twentieth century, especially since the 1970s, and the research that was carried out into its rhetorical possibilities, which implied a step forward in the hybridization of verbal and visual language. One of the most productive forms of experimentation, and one shared by many authors, was the meta-literary games that invited readers to reflect on the artistic communication processes: these games used, above all, the material side of language and the co-existence of the word with other codes and languages. These meta-literary games led to another type of proposal that aimed to shake up readers and awaken their critical faculties when faced with the substantial amount of messages coming from the mass media; in short, they fostered what we call literacy, with poems that made use of materials taken from or inspired by the press or advertising, and gave them a new perspective. Finally, the article briefly questions whether critics and contemporary readers appreciated this poetry in all its social and combative dimensions, or whether it was viewed as hermetic and elitist poetry, with no links to social reality.",0,1

"This paper is an attempt to show that given the available observations on the behaviour of negation and presuppositions there is no simpler explanation than to assume that natural language has two distinct negation operators, the minimal negation which preserves presuppositions and the radical negation which does not. The three-valued logic emerging from this distinction, and especially its model-theory, are discussed in detail. It is, however, stressed that the logic itself is only epiphenomenal on the structures and processes involved in the interpretation of sentences. Horn (1985) brings new observations to bear, related with metalinguistic uses of negation, and proposes a “pragmatic” ambiguity in negation to the effect that in descriptive (or “straight”) use negation is the classical bivalent operator, whereas in metalinguistic use it is non-truthfunctional but only pragmatic. Van der Sandt (to appear) accepts Horn's observations but proposes a different solution: he proposes an ambiguity in the argument clause of the negation operator (which, for him, too, is classical and bivalent), according to whether the negation takes only the strictly asserted proposition or covers also the presuppositions, the (scalar) implicatures and other implications (in particular of style and register) of the sentence expressing that proposition. These theories are discussed at some length. The three-valued analysis is defended on the basis of partly new observations, which do not seem to fit either Horn's or Van der Sandt's solution. It is then placed in the context of incremental discourse semantics, where both negations are seen to do the job of keeping increments out of the discourse domain, though each does so in its own specific way. The metalinguistic character of the radical negation is accounted for in terms of the incremental apparatus. The metalinguistic use of negation in denials of implicatures or implications of style and register is regarded as a particular form of minimal negation, where the negation denies not the proposition itself but the appropriateness of the use of an expression in it. This appropriateness negation is truth-functional and not pragmatic, but it applies to a particular, independently motivated, analysis of the argument clause. The ambiguity of negation in natural language is different from the ordinary type of ambiguity found in the lexicon. Normally, lexical ambiguities are idiosyncratic, highly contingent, and unpredictable from language to language. In the case of negation, however, the two meanings are closely related, both truth-conditionally and incrementally. Moreover, the mechanism of discourse incrementation automatically selects the right meaning. These properties are taken to provide a sufficient basis for discarding the, otherwise valid, objection that negation is unlikely to be ambiguous because no known language makes a lexical distinction between the two readings.",0,1
"Reviewed by: A short morphology, phonology and vocabulary of Kiput, Sarawak Adrian Clynes Robert Blust . 2003. A short morphology, phonology and vocabulary of Kiput, Sarawak. PL 546. Canberra: Pacific Linguistics. vii + 102 pp. ISBN: 0-85883-536-3. Aus$31.50, paper. With this work the author continues a series of sketch phonologies and morphologies of Sarawak languages begun with Blust (1977) and (1988). This volume differs from the previous two both in format and in including, in addition to the descriptive sketch, discussion of features of interest to phonological theory. It is based on fieldwork carried out in 1971 as part of a larger project to collect comparative data on ""over 40 language communities in northwest Borneo,"" the immediate result of which was the author's dissertation (Blust 1974). The briefness of the time spent gathering data on Kiput—""no more than 20-25 hours collection time,"" with no opportunity for further visits—shows and limits the quality of the description in various ways, as the author acknowledges. The data are then at times uneven, and some analyses are controversial. Still, in a very short time Blust was able to gather an enviable amount of information, and on a language that is no doubt endangered. The publication is therefore welcome, adding as it does to our meager knowledge of Kiput and, indirectly, of related languages. Data were collected primarily from one of two informants, both of whom were in their teens. The 32 years' delay in publication is due in part ""to uncertainties regarding some of the phonetic transcriptions (vii)."" I have experienced similar uncertainties when working on the closely related Belait (Clynes 2005a), particularly over issues of contrastive length, but also because speakers of Belait can produce a disconcerting variety of phonetic realizations of the same item. Blust mentions the first problem (38) and may well have experienced the latter difficulty, as he has reported phonetic variability in the also closely related Miri (Blust 1974). Beatrice Clayre (pers. comm.) has suggested that this variability is an areal feature in eastern Sarawak. The work has two parts, the Discussion, which gives the grammatical analysis—often with a historical-comparative slant, not surprising given the broader interests of the author—and the Vocabulary, a glossary or dictionary of Kiput containing more than 930 lexical bases. The Discussion is in turn divided into five sections: Background, Subsystems, Morphology, Phonology, and Vocabulary. I will describe these in turn, adding some comments. The Background section gives information on the location and number of speakers, the ""genealogy"" of the language, and previous relevant publications. In 1971 there were ""perhaps 450"" speakers, said to be confined to a single longhouse on the Baram River. That number has probably declined since then, given general trends of language loss in the region (cf., for example, various papers in Martin [1994], including Bibi Aminah Abdul Ghani and Abang Ahmad Ridzuan on Miri, Martin [1995] on minority languages in Brunei, including the closely related Belait and Tutong, and Bibi Aminah [2005] on Bintulu). The position of Kiput in the Berawan-Lower Baram branch of the North Sarawak subgroup of Austronesian—itself first named and described by Blust (1974)—is outlined. Of the four previous publications mentioned that are entirely or partially devoted to Kiput, three are by Blust himself (1974, 2000, 2002), the fourth by Ray (1913). [End Page 262] The data collection process is alluded to rather than described (contrasts having been checked in the last two or three meetings with some tape recordings being made at the same time). The main or only method of data collection appears to have been elicitation of single words and simple sentences. This was a reasonable approach given the larger aims and limitations of the 1971 project, even if it inevitably limits the conclusions the author can make. The next section of the Discussion, Subsystems, gives brief information in turn about numerals and nominal classifiers, personal and possessive pronouns, demonstrative pronouns, and kinship terms. Of interest to this reader were the trial/paucal pronoun series (which I may have missed in Belait) and the lack of a distinct Object/Oblique pronoun series (Belait has such a series).

"Objectives: Studies analyzing the macrostructure and microstructure in the narrative samples of participants with Parkinson’s disease (PD) are limited in the Indian context. This study investigates the micro and macrostructure discourse analysis by using a picture elicited narrative discourse task in Kannada speaking persons with idiopathic PD.Method: Two groups comprising 12 Kannada-speaking individuals with idiopathic PD in the age range of 60–85 years and 12 neuro-typical individuals matched on age, sex, socioeconomic status, language, dialect, and knowledge of other languages participated in the study. To assess their discourse skills, participants were provided with a series of eight pictures to narrate a story for a minimum of 2–3 min. All the samples were transcribed orthographically and were divided into communication units. The communication units were analyzed in terms of micro and macro structures. The macrostructure analysis included the measures such as initial event (IE), an action aiming at resolving at resolving problem (ARP), and outcome of action (OA). The microstructure analysis included the proportion of content words (PCW), proportion of functional words (PFW), proportion of morphemes (PM), total number of different words (NDW) and type token ratio (TTR).Results: The results revealed that there was a significant difference between the two groups on several of the macro and microstructure measures. Specifically there was a significant difference on ARP, PCW, PFW, NDW and TTR.Conclusion: Based on the results it can be concluded that the micro and certain aspects of macrostructure discourse skills of Kannada speakers with idiopathic PD were affected. Thus, in addition to speech impairment, language structure is also affected in persons with PD.",0,1
"In this paper we present an extended description of two resources for natural language processing of Breton, a morphological analyser and constraint grammar-based disambiguator. The constraint grammar was developed using a novel methodology by a linguist and a language consultant creating rules to solve specific errors in disambiguation in a machine translation system. In addition we introduce a new morphologically-disambiguated corpus of Breton and evaluate both the morphological analyser and constraint grammar for coverage and accuracy. For comparison we use the same corpus to train several reference systems for part-of-speech tagging and lemmatisation and compare the performance. The experiments show that our system outperforms the reference systems by a wide margin when the reference systems are trained without an external full-form list, and performs comparably when they are trained with a full-form list generated from our morphological analyser.",0,1

Ce dictionnaire, consacre au civili, poursuit ainsi la tradition des ouvrages lexicographiques commences par les missionnaires. Pour le civili notamment on peut citer les contributions des reverends peres Derouet (n.d.) et Marichelle (1902) qui furent imprimes a la vieille imprimerie de Loango. Dans la preface du Dictionnaire vili-francais (en abrege DVF dans le reste du texte), le R.P. Marichelle precise que la parution de son dictionnaire vient completer l'oeuvre du R.P. Derouet auteur du Dictionnaire francais-vili. Hormis les travaux lexicographiques sur le civili, deux autres ouvrages ont egalement ete publies. Il s'agit de Proverbes et dictons du Loango en Afrique Centrale de Rene Mavoungou Pambou (1997) et de Parlons vili de Gervais Loembe (2005).

"A study was conducted in order to determine the usefulness of an American college desk dictionary (a monolingual English dictionary for native-speakers) used by English as a Second Language (ESL) students when taking a vocabulary test. Seventy-four advanced ESL learners were selected from sections of an English composition course for international students. The students were divided into three experimental groups. Group 1 selected equivalents for a test item on a multiple-choice test by using only the monolingual English dictionary. Group 2 read a short story that included the tested vocabulary; after reading the story, Group 2 took the same multiple-choice test without the aid of any dictionary. Group 3 read the short story with the tested vocabulary and used the monolingual English dictionary while taking the same multiple-choice test. A statistically significant difference in the test scores was found between Group 3 and the other two groups, indicating that dictionary use that supplements the use of contextual cues is beneficial. No statistical difference was found between Groups 1 and 2, indicating that dictionary use without a supporting discursive context provides no measurable advantage over inferring or guessing the meaning of a word within a written discourse.",0,1
"Zusammenfassung Gegenstand dieses Beitrags sind im mentalen Lexikon gespeicherte Wortschatzinformationen. Neben dem häufig untersuchten Bereich des Wortschatzumfangs wird auch das aus dem angloamerikanischen Sprachraum stammende Konstrukt der Wortschatzqualität oder -tiefe einbezogen. Untersuchungen aus verschiedenen Fachdisziplinen füllen dieses Konstrukt unterschiedlich, z. B. durch die Differenziertheit semantischen Wissens oder Netzwerkwissen (i. e. Wissen über die Relation eines Lexems zu anderen). Wir betrachten eine trennscharfe Differenzierung einerseits nach Umfang und Qualität, andererseits innerhalb der Wortschatzqualität als wichtige Grundlage für zukünftige psycholinguistische Forschung. Forschungsbedarf besteht vor didaktischem Hintergrund insbesondere für das Alter des „fortgesetzten Spracherwerbs“, d. h. bei Kindern ab ca. 4 bis 5 Jahren und während der Grundschulzeit, das bisher im deutschsprachigen Raum weitgehend ausgespart wurde. Untersuchungen zu diesem Alterssegment bilden die Grundlage für eine gezielte und wirkungsvolle schulische Förderung von Wortschatzkompetenzen, die als „Schaltstelle des schulischen Spracherwerbs“ (Steinhoff 2009) und als von „eminenter Bedeutung für die Bildungsprozesse des Kindes“ (Komor und Reich 2009: 57) angesehen werden und eine prominente Rolle bei rezeptiven wie produktiven Sprachfertigkeiten spielen.",0,1
"This article discusses the diachronic development of the Chinese long passive. The diachronic analysis is built on structural analysis of the long passive and the wei … suo passive. I show that both constructions involve a highly restricted embedded clause (a vP) and that both are derived via Aʹ-movement. Based on their structural parallelism, I argue that the wei … suo passive, which first appeared in Late Archaic Chinese (fifth century bce ~ third century bce), is the direct ancestor of the long passive. The long passive inherits its Aʹ properties and biclausal structure from the wei … suo passive. I also show that the diachronic development from the wei … suo passive to the long passive took place in two steps: (i) the loss of suo following a morphophonological change in Early Middle Chinese (second century bce ~ second century ce, and (ii) the replacement of wei by bei in Middle Chinese (third century ce ~ sixth century ce).",0,1

"In languages with numeral classifier systems, nouns must generally appear with one of a series of classifiers in order to be modified by a numeral. This squib presents new data from Mi’gmaq (Algonquian) and Chol (Mayan), arguing that numeral classifiers are required because of the syntactic and semantic properties of the numeral (as in Krifka 1995), rather than the noun (as in Chierchia 1998). The results are shown to have important consequences for the mass/count distinction.Mandarin Chinese is a frequently cited example of a language with numeral classifiers. As shown in (1), classifiers cannot be dropped in the presence of numerals.Krifka (1995) and Chierchia (1998) provide two very different accounts of the theoretical distinction between languages with classifiers (like Mandarin) and those without (like English). Chierchia links the distinction to the nominal system, arguing that nonclassifier languages have a mass/count distinction among nouns, while classifier languages do not. All nouns in Mandarin are likened to mass nouns in English. Krifka, on the other hand, proposes that the difference lies in the numeral system. He argues that classifier languages morphologically separate the semantic measure function (i.e., the classifier) from the numerals, whereas nonclassifier languages have a measure function incorporated into the numerals. Here we bring in new data from Mi’gmaq and Chol to distinguish between the two theories. In both languages, certain numerals obligatorily appear with classifiers, while others never do. We show that these idiosyncratic numeral systems cannot be accounted for under Chierchia’s influential (1998) proposal. Furthermore, we show that these results have consequences for the mass/count distinction. Krifka’s theory, unlike Chierchia’s, treats the classifier/nonclassifier distinction as being theoretically independent of the syntactic mass/count distinction (see Wilhelm 2008). We question whether it is meaningful, or even empirically justified, to maintain a mass/count distinction once classifier systems are treated in this way.Chierchia (1998) argues that numerals have a uniform interpretation in both classifier and nonclassifier languages, but hypothesizes a difference in the nominal systems. In English, there are two categories of nouns: one consisting of nouns that are directly compatible with numeral modification (so-called count nouns, like table and girl), and another consisting of nouns that are not (so-called mass nouns, like furniture and water). Chierchia proposes that in a classifier language like Mandarin there is only one category of noun, and, much like the English category of mass nouns, this category is not directly compatible with numeral modification. A simplified version of Cherchia’s nominal interpretations is shown in (2), where ∩ is a function from predicates to kinds.1 Here the Mandarin noun zhuō—zi ‘table’ in (2a) denotes a kind, like the English mass noun furniture in (2b), but unlike the English count noun table in (2c), which denotes a set of atoms.According to Chierchia (1998), numeral modification relies on measure functions that count (stable) atoms. The kinds in (2a) and (2b), in contrast to the set in (2c), contain no such atoms. As a result, they must be converted into atomic sets before combining with numerals. Thus, just as English mass nouns require measure words to combine with numerals (e.g., ‘two pieces of furniture’), so all nouns in Mandarin require classifiers that convert kinds into atomic sets.Chierchia-style denotations for numerals and classifiers are provided in (3), where ATOMIC is a function true of predicates with atomic minimal parts (i.e., atoms); μ# Is a measure function from a group to the cardinality of that group; and * is a closure operator from a set of entities to the set of all sums that can be formed from those entities (Link 1983).2The numeral liǎng in (3a) is a function from atomic sets to sets of groups composed of two members from the atomic set. The classifier zhāng in (3b) is a function from kinds to predicates, represented as ∪.When a classifier like zhāng combines with a nominal like zhuōzi (as in (1a)), the result is denotationally equivalent to an English count noun. This is illustrated in (4).For Krifka (1995), denotations of nominals in Mandarin are comparable to those of nominals in English, shown in the simplified version of his theory in (5).3The difference lies in the numerals. Krifka (1995) hypothesizes that there are two different types of numeral interpretations crosslinguistically (see also Wilhelm 2008). On the one hand, there are numerals in nonclassifier languages like English. These have an incorporated measure function, μ#, and combine directly with nouns, as illustrated for English two in (6a).4 On the other hand, there are Mandarin-like numerals like liǎng in (6b). These do not have an incorporated measure function and thus require classifiers such as zhāng in (6c) to introduce a measure.5Under this account, a Mandarin numeral-plus-classifier is semantically equivalent to an English numeral, as shown in (7).As Krifka (1995) notes,6 there is very little evidence internal to English or Mandarin that would favor one proposal over the other. Both theories succeed in capturing the fact that Mandarin requires classifiers for counting, while English does not. For Chierchia, classifiers are necessary because of a deficiency of the nouns: they do not denote countable entities. For Krifka, classifiers are necessary because of a problem with the numerals: informally speaking, they do not come specified with information about which types of things they count.7In Western Armenian, the presence or absence of a classifier is completely optional, as shown in (8). (For similar examples and observations, see Donabédian 1993.)The two theories described above offer two possible explanations for this variation. Under Chierchia’s (1998) account, the noun dəgha ‘boy’ would be ambiguous, having one meaning that permits the noun to combine directly with numerals (a ‘‘count’’ denotation, as in (9a)) and another that requires a classifier (a ‘‘mass’’ denotation, as in (9b)). Numerals and classifiers have denotations as in (9c–d), similar to the denotations in (3).Krifka (1995), in contrast, could hypothesize that the noun dəgha ‘boy’ has a consistent count-type interpretation, but the numeral yergu is ambiguous. One meaning incorporates a measure function, as in (10b). The other meaning does not, as in (10c). See Borer 2005 for a similar proposal.There is no clear way to decide between the two theories language-internally in Western Armenian.8 However, this optionality raises an interesting consideration, namely, the possibility of variation within a single language. The two theories make different predictions with respect to crosslinguistic variation: Krifka’s numeral-based theory predicts the possibility of a language with idiosyncratic behavior among the numerals, whereas Chierchia’s theory is inconsistent with such a pattern. In section 3, we provide examples of languages that exhibit idiosyncratic patterns in the numeral domain, and we show that these data are uniquely compatible with Krifka’s account of classifiers.In Mi’gmaq, an Eastern Algonquian language, numerals 1–5 (along with numerals morphologically built from 1–5) do not appear with classifiers, while numerals 6 and higher must. In (11a), the numeral na’n ‘five’ combines directly with the noun; the classifier te’s is impossible, as shown in (11b).In contrast, the numeral asugom ‘six’ in (12a) cannot combine directly with a noun. It must instead appear with the classifier te’s, as shown in (12b).9Chol, a Mayan language of southern Mexico, also demonstrates idiosyncratic behavior in the numeral system. Mayan languages have a vigesimal (base 20) numeral system. Many speakers today, however, generally know and use Chol numerals only for numbers 1–6, 10, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, and 400 (Vázquez Álvarez 2011:180); otherwise, they use number words borrowed from Spanish.As shown in (13), the traditional Mayan numerals, like ux ‘three’, require a classifier.In contrast, the Spanish-based numerals, like nuebe ‘nine’, cannot be used with classifiers, as shown in (14). This contrast is consistent across all Spanish- and Mayan-based numerals in the language and cannot be reduced to other factors like phonological size: multisyllabic Chol numerals like waxäk ‘eight’ still require classifiers, and Spanishbased numerals like ses ‘six’ still prohibit them.It should be noted that this is true not just of bilingual Spanish–Chol speakers, but also of speakers who are essentially monolingual in Chol. Regardless of degree of fluency, age, or level of bilingualism, speakers consistently find classifiers on Spanish-based numerals to be ungrammatical. Furthermore, this variation is not found within the nominal system. Nominals borrowed from Spanish require classifiers when they are used in conjunction with a Chol numeral, as shown with the Spanish loan mansana ‘apple’ in (15a). When such nominals appear with numerals of Spanish origin, no classifier is possible, as in (15b).10Both Mi’gmaq and Chol have some numerals that require classifiers, and some numerals that cannot appear with classifiers. This is consistent with an approach in which nominals have a consistent denotation and variation is found within the numerals themselves—that is, Krifka’s (1995) analysis. This is illustrated below with Chol lexical items, but is readily transportable to Mi’gmaq.Under Krifka’s analysis, nominals like tyumuty ‘egg’ have denotations equivalent to those of their English counterparts. The noun tyumuty is a predicate true of eggs, as in (16).The requirement for a classifier is dependent, not on the noun, but on the syntax and semantics of the numeral. In Chol, the interpretation of Spanish-origin nuebe ‘nine’ is a nominal modifier that has a cardinality measure (μ#) built into its meaning, as shown in (17).In contrast, the interpretation of ux (Chol ‘three’) is a function that takes a measure function as an argument, such as the cardinality measure p’ej, and yields a numeral modifier. This is illustrated in (18).As illustrated in (19a), nuebe can combine directly with nouns like tyumuty to yield a set of groups where each group consists of 9 individual items (eggs, in the case of tyumuty). However, the combination of nuebe with a classifier leads to a type mismatch and presupposition failure.The opposite pattern holds for ux, as illustrated in (19b). Combining ux directly with tyumuty leads to a type mismatch, whereas combining it with the classifier p’ej and then tyumuty yields a set of groups where each group consists of 3 individual eggs.Unlike Krifka’s theory, Chierchia’s cannot account for the patterns illustrated in (19). To account for acceptable forms where numerals combine directly with nouns, such as nuebe tyumuty, as well as forms where classifiers intervene, such as ux-p’ejtyumuty, Chierchia would need to hypothesize that nouns in Mi’gmaq and Chol are ambiguous. Under this account, all nouns would have two interpretations: one interpretation that requires classifiers, and another that does not, as shown in (20a). The numerals would have interpretations that were independent of the classifier, whereas the classifier would be a function from kinds to sets, as shown in (20b–c).Critically, if nouns like tyumuty in (20a) are ambiguous in this respect, then the ungrammatical forms are unexpected. Nothing would prevent a classifier-less Mayan numeral from combining with the interpretation of tyumuty ‘egg’ that denotes an atomic set. Similarly, nothing would rule out the possibility that the kind-denoting variant of tyumuty could combine with the Spanish-based numeral nuebe, requiring a classifier.However, these combinations of numerals and classifiers are not acceptable.Syntactic facts also favor Krifka’s analysis. In Chol, classifiers morphologically attach as suffixes to numerals. Although Mi’gmaq classifiers are separate words, word order effects provide similar evidence that numerals and classifiers form a constituent independent of the noun. As shown in (22a–b), the numeral and classifier can be separated as a unit from the noun. However, as shown in (22c), the classifier and noun cannot be separated from the numeral. This suggests that there is a tighter connection between the numeral and classifier than between the classifier and noun.Li and Thompson (1981) propose that the numeral and classifier form a constituent in Mandarin Chinese, although see Zhang 2011 for a more nuanced discussion of classifier-noun constituency.Note that the evidence above only demonstrates that classifier systems in some languages are uniquely compatible with Krifka’s theory. It has not been demonstrated that all languages have the same kind of classifier system. It is possible that there are two types, one like Krifka’s and another that patterns as Chierchia’s theory would predict. Indeed, the investigation of Mi’gmaq and Chol provides a template for the kind of pattern one would need to find to establish the existence of this other classifier system. Unlike Krifka’s theory, Chierchia’s predicts that it should be possible to have a lexical numeral that requires a classifier when modifying one noun, yet prohibits a classifier when modifying another.Such a pattern would demonstrate that the presence or absence of a classifier depends on the noun that is being modified rather than on the numeral. On the surface, one might think that English has such patterns, as shown in (24).However, the status of this as an example of Chierchia’s predicted pattern rests on the classification of item and the use of the partitive preposition of. Are measure words like item and kilo classifiers? Unlike classifiers in other languages, these words have the same distributions as regular nouns and take nominal morphology such as plural marking. In other words, the surface evidence suggests that these words do not belong to the same type of category as classifiers (for discussion, see Cheng and Sybesma 1999).Whether Chierchia’s predicted pattern exists or not is an empirical matter, one that will not be resolved here. However, the mere existence of Krifka-style classifiers, even if they are not universal, has some consequences for the study of syntax and semantics crosslinguistically.Mi’gmaq and Chol demonstrate that, at least in some languages, the factors governing the appearance of classifiers are independent of the existence of a syntactic distinction between mass and count nouns (for discussion, see Wilhelm 2008). A weak implication of this finding is that the presence or absence of a rich classifier system is not a reliable diagnostic for whether a language has count nouns or not. However, this separation of classifier systems from nominal distinctions calls into question whether it is useful to classify languages in terms of mass/count. As Bloomfield (1933) discusses, what makes the mass/count distinction interesting are the corresponding semantic and syntactic patterns that are, in principle, separable from the ontological divide between ‘‘countable things’’ and ‘‘uncountable stuff ’’ (see also Bunt 1985, Gillon 1992, Chierchia 1998, Bale and Barner 2009). For example, consider the following grammatical properties associated with count syntax:Mandarin does not allow numerals to combine directly with nouns, has a rich classifier system, does not have a productive plural marker, and lacks allomorphy among its quantifiers. English, in contrast, has two lexical noun categories (mass and count), has no classifier system, has a productive plural, allows numerals to combine directly with nouns, and permits quantifier allomorphy. Linguists influenced by Bloomfield (1933) have explored the hypothesis that this clustering of properties is in some way connected: that noncount languages pattern like Mandarin, whereas count languages pattern like English.However, previous work has shown that plural marking does not always cluster with the other properties (Borer 2005, Bale and Barner 2012). Mi’gmaq and Chol demonstrate further that classifiers are independent of the nominal distinction in some languages. The fact that the first three properties in (25) do not reliably cluster together weakens the utility of classifying languages in terms of whether they have a mass/count distinction or not. Since the only correlation remaining is the relatively minor connection between quantifier allomorphy and singular denotations, one wonders whether it is better for investigative purposes to give up on the term mass/count language, which carries with it the burden of being defined with respect to all of the properties in (25), and instead concentrate on the individual properties independent of whether they correlate or not in any given language.",0,1

"This article investigates the role that the phonetic parameters of duration and voicing play in shaping asymmetric patterns of Romance stop-liquid cluster realization. Based on acoustic analysis of experimental data from Quebec French and Argentine Spanish, we demonstrate the existence of an asymmetry in the proportional duration of the stop and a following epenthetic vowel or lateral: sonorants are shorter after voiceless stops in stop–liquid clusters. Rhotics do not participate in this process. The Spanish tap does not vary significantly in length, and the French dorsal fricative is longer in voiceless clusters. We propose that compensatory adjustments of the following sonorant are the result of the interaction of coarticulatory constraints, both universal (shorter sonorants after voiceless stops or fricatives) and language-specific (voicing in dorsal fricatives in French). Parallels are drawn between the synchronic variation attested and well-known patterns of diachronic change in Romance.",0,1
"One component of D. Bickerton's Language Bioprogram Hypothesis is here empirically tested by reviewing studies of children's comprehension and production of articles. Seven studies reporting relevant data in English and French were reviewed. Two of them provide clear empirical support for the hypothesis that children are universally sensitive to the specific/non-specific distinction of referential meaning. Moreover, findings of all reviewed studies were generally consistent with a four-stage hypothesis of the acquisition of English and French articles, characterized by (a) the use of the indefinite and/or definite article(s) for specific referents, and zero article for both non-specific referents and naming; (b) the use of the indefinite article for non-specific referents, and the definite article for specific referents whether or not they are presupposed; (c) an increase in the correct use of the indefinite article for specific, non-presupposed referents, with a concomitant decrease in the correct use of the definite article for specific, presupposed referents; and (d) the correct use of the definite and indefinite articles.",0,1

Two formal treatments of this phenomenon are developed: first in terms of the Conceptual Semantic framework of Moens & Steedman (1988), the second in terms of the model-theoretic framework espoused by Richard Montague and his followers.",0,1

"The compendium is composed of eight chapters plus the editors’ introduction entitled ‘Internet Lexicography’. It is edited by Annette Klosa (currently Head of DAAD Information Centre HCMC/ Institute of the German Language (IDS), Mannheim) and Caroline Müller-Spitzer (IDS, Mannheim) in collaboration with Martin Loder, scientific assistant at the IDS, Mannheim (until March 2016), and is a result of network meetings within the framework of the academic Network of Internet Lexicography, which was funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG). The Network’s meetings took place between 2011 and 2013. Participants were academic lexicographers and researchers from different universities, research institutes und dictionary projects in Germany and beyond (Italy, Denmark, Netherlands). Consequently, the meetings and workshops organized by the Network were concerned not only with German lexicography, but also with developments in other languages. The aim of this network and thus this publication was to address current questions in the field of digital lexicography, in particular the development and publication of dictionaries on the internet. The compendium finalizes this goal by imparting central aspects of ongoing research and practice. From the book’s title, the reader will expect a state-of-the-art view of the field of internet lexicography. The style and structure, however, also serve the needs of laymen to a certain extent. As the book deals with lexicography in a dynamic, fast-moving environment, the comprehensive coverage can only be achieved in part. Therefore, the authors are not discussing technical issues which are too transient, such as developments in web design.",0,1
"ABSTRACT This study provides and tests pedagogical materials for teaching Korean multimodal (im)politeness, reflecting recent findings on the role of nonverbal means of communication in the communication of (im)politeness. A pedagogy of multiliteracies is implemented in this study, which supports the development of language learners' multimodal competence. Within the multiliteracies classroom, learners are encouraged to actively express their identities via language and other multimodal means. In order to examine the effectiveness of multiliteracies framework in enhancing identity negotiation, the activities performed by language learners to express their identities are analyzed from an activity-theoretic perspective. This study includes an 80-minute lesson designed around the theme of yeyuy ‘manners, etiquette’ in Korea for intermediate-level Korean learners as well as a qualitative analysis of the classroom interaction where the lesson was carried out. The analysis shows that language learners construct and negotiate their first-language and second-language identities producing multimodal identity artifacts, while expressing their own perspectives on Korean (im)politeness and dealing with the views held by the teacher, their classmates, and materials. It is also demonstrated that learners recognize the significance of multimodal resources involved in authentic media texts and critically evaluate the (im)politeness-related meanings that the resources intend to signal.",0,1

"Abstract The paper introduces the principle Maximise Presupposition and its cognates. The main focus of the literature and this article is on the inferences that arise as a result of reasoning with Maximise Presupposition (‘anti‐presuppositions’). I will review the arguments put forward for distinguishing them from other inference types, most notably presuppositions and conversational implicatures. I will zoom in on three main issues regarding Maximise Presupposition and these inferences critically discussed in the literature: epistemic strength(ening), projection, and the role of alternatives. I will discuss more recent views which argue for either a uniform treatment of anti‐presuppositions and implicatures and/or a revision of the original principle in light of new data and developments in pragmatics.",0,1
"In this study we investigated whether the beneficial effect of adding illustrations to text can be explained by the fact that illustrations facilitate analogous mental representation construction from text in visuospatial working memory. For this the secondary task paradigm was used. It was expected that the secondary task interfered only with learning from text when no illustrations were presented beforehand, because here learners have to construct an analogous mental model on their own, and consequently working memory load should be high. No interference of the secondary task was expected when illustrations were presented. Additionally, it was assumed that learners with illustration performed on a higher level. Contrast analyses confirmed this data pattern when reading (Experiments 1 and 3) or listening to the text (Experiment 2) and with less (Experiments 1 and 2) and more complex learning materials (Experiment 3) for recall tasks. These findings indicate that illustrations before text supported learners in constructing an analogous mental representation from the text, explaining why no secondary task interference was observed when illustrations were presented. The implications of these findings are discussed.",0,1

"The role of major northwestern Indian rivers in sustaining the Harappan civilisation has been a much-debated topic in Indian archaeology. Reconstruction of palaeo-river courses using remote sensing images and their association with the mighty rivers (viz. Sarasvati and Drishadvati) mentioned in ancient Indian literature, has long been contested. The relationship of these rivers to the Ghaggar and Chautang channels, believed to be the former course of the glacially fed Sutlej and Yamuna rivers respectively, has also been debated. A mighty river of glacial origin has been hypothesised to have sustained the Harappan civilisation, and yet the spatial and temporal associations between palaeo-river courses and the Harappans are poorly understood. We provide new quartz optically stimulated luminescence dates from stratigraphically controlled samples from the palaeo-river bed and adjacent floodplain of the Chautang River near Hissar in Haryana, to elucidate the timing of glacially derived fluvial activity and examine its synchronicity with the Harappan cultures. Our results disprove the proposed link between ancient settlements and large rivers from the Himalayas and indicate that the major palaeo-fluvial system traversing through this region ceased long before the establishment of the Harappan civilisation. These results are further corroborated through a review of archaeological data to assess the spatial and temporal variation in the abundance of Harappan sites along a perennial and ephemeral riverine corridor. This synthesis of archaeological data also urges caution over the linear association of the number of ancient settlements with the strength of rivers.",0,1
"Yorùbá personal names have been studied from different perspectives. A critical look at the linguistic processes involved in the anglicisation of Yorùbá personal names appears to be relatively unexplored. As such, this study explores linguistic formation patterns of anglicised traditional Yorùbá anthroponyms. The study adopts the descriptive research design and analyses 50 samples of anglicised Yorùbá anthroponyms by drawing insights from the concepts of insertion or epenthesis, consonant clustering and diacritic removal in phonology. The research shows that some instances of the anglicised Yorùbá names include: Hardebisi from Adebisi, Haryoh from Ayọ, Fehmih from Femi, Holar from Ọla and Hormosewah from Omosewa. The finding of the research also reveals that prothesis, paragoge, consonant clustering and removal of diacritics are the linguistic formation patterns prevalent in the anglicised Yorùbá traditional anthroponyms. The researchers recommend further research on the role of gender in the anglicisation of names.",0,1

"The purpose of this article is to explore the role commitments may play in shaping our sense of joint agency. First, we propose that commitments may contribute to the generation of the sense of joint agency by stabilizing expectations and improving predictability. Second, we argue that commitments have a normative element that may bolster an agent's sense of control over the joint action and help counterbalance the potentially disruptive effects of asymmetries among agents. Finally, we discuss how commitments may contribute to make acting jointly emotionally rewarding, both by improving coordination and by inducing or reinforcing the circumstances under which shared emotions emerge among co‐agents.",0,1
"The present study analyses 3- to 6-year-old children’s dialect-standard repertoires in an Austrian-Bavarian sociolinguistic setting and investigates how far individual repertoires can be explained by input and sociodemographic factors. Adults’ linguistic repertoires in the area typically comprise a certain spectrum on the dialect-standard continuum but individual acquisition processes have hardly been studied yet. We collected language data from 49 children in five different communicative interactions each and analyzed the repertoire each child exhibits. The majority of children could be shown to have a bi-varietal repertoire at their disposal, but there were substantial numbers of children who exhibited either standard-only or dialect-only repertoires. We then examined the relationships between a child’s repertoire and potentially relevant input and sociodemographic variables. While language variety use in the home and maternal education did not prove significant predictors of children’s repertoires, gender, age, location, bilingualism and frequency of being read to did.",0,1
"ResumenEl estudio de la primera lexicografía hispanoamericana después de la independencia de España ha descuidado hasta hoy la estrecha relación que existe entre los primeros diccionarios, llamados de provincialismos, y el contexto socio-histórico en el que fueron elaborados. Como parte de este, el proceso de formación nacional, especialmente en relación con la creación política de un Estado y su repercusión en las sociedades hispanoamericanas, es un elemento que marca con claridad la naturaleza de las obras encuestión, de tal manera que puede hablarse de una determinante impronta política en ellas. Este artículo propone el estudio renovado de las obras fundacionales de la lexicografía hispanoamericana a partir de esta perspectiva y lo ejemplifica con la lectura y comparación de las dos más representativas, el Diccionario de chilenismos (1875) de Zorobabel Rodríguez y el Diccionario de peruanismos. Ensayo filológico (1883-1884) de Juan de Arona, especialmente en relación con la noción de republicanismo.So far the study of the first Latin American lexicography after it’s independence from Spain has neglected the close relationship between the first dictionaries, referred as “provincialism dictionaries”, and the socio-historical context in which they were elaborated. The process of nation-building, especially in relation to the creation of a state policy and its impact in Latin American societies, is an element that makes clear the nature of the works in question, so that we can talk about a decisive political imprint on them. This paper proposes a renewed study of the foundational works of Spanish American lexicography from this perspective and exemplified with reading and comparison of the two most representative dictionaries, the Zorobabel Rodríguez’s Diccionario de chilenismos (1875) and the Juan de Arona’s Diccionario de peruanismos.

"It has long been understood that speakers produce and listeners perceive non-random, systematic phonetic variants that serve as the raw material for sound change. This understanding underlies much of the current research on the phonetic underpinnings of change, which includes study of (i) general phonetic principles underlying variation, (ii) specific phonetic ‘preconditions’ and biases arguably linked to specific patterns of phonological instability and change, and (iii) the production and perception of variation by speaker-listeners in situations of actual ongoing change and by interacting agents in computational simulations of change. This paper shows how findings from these three broad areas of study have led to 21st century theoretical and empirical advancements in our understanding of phonetic change. Big-picture questions about the nature of change are approached through consideration of a series of smaller, more tractable questions (e.g., about the nature of, and relation between, innovative speaking and innovative listening for both stable patterns of variation and ongoing change). The paper’s goals are to show, for these questions, their theoretical grounding, empirical challenges, preliminary answers and, in turn, the new theoretical directions emerging from those answers.",0,1
"The paper explores the morphological expression of focus on the example of Focus Particle (FP) in Kakabe. The analysis addresses questions that are rarely if ever investigated with respect to morphological focus: i) how FP is related to the boundaries of a focus constituent, in particular, VP and IP focus; ii) how givenness affects the position of FP; iii) FP with respect to types of CP and CP boundaries. I demonstrate that, even though FP resembles prosodic focus in some respects, its distribution cannot be fitted into a prosodic account of focus, contra Büring 2010 and Féry 2013. More specifically, I propose that Kakabe has a Focus operator located lower than CP. Similarly to Cable’s (2006, 2010) Q-operator that can be involved a bi-partite agreement relationship, Foc operator agrees at a time with C0 above it and with the DP below it. I demonstrate how the pattern of FP distribution follows, in particular, from the conditions on Agree (Chomsky 2000, 2001), such as locality, superiority and activity conditions.",0,1

"Fake content is flourishing on the Internet, ranging from basic random word salads to web scraping. Most of this fake content is generated for the purpose of nourishing fake web sites aimed at biasing search engine indexes: at the scale of a search engine, using automatically generated texts render such sites harder to detect than using copies of existing pages. In this paper, we present three methods aimed at distinguishing natural texts from artificially generated ones: the first method uses basic lexicometric features, the second one uses standard language models and the third one is based on a relative entropy measure which captures short range dependencies between words. Our experiments show that lexicometric features and language models are efficient to detect most generated texts, but fail to detect texts that are generated with high order Markov models. By comparison our relative entropy scoring algorithm, especially when trained on a large corpus, allows us to detect these “hard” text generators with a high degree of accuracy.",0,1
"The punctuation system of mediaeval manuscripts can be compared to the experience of using a new software application. When confronted with scribal punctuation for the first time, it is as if you had the intimidating commands of the menu bar in front of you, waiting for a mouse click. In the case of punctuation marks, one cannot help but look at them with a bewildered glance and wonder about the kinds of pauses that they signal, or even try to find some sort of coherence within the set of symbols at hand. This has been precisely the general contention until late in the 20th century, before which time scribal punctuation had been neglected in the assumption that it was meaningless and haphazard, scattered at random through the folios of the manuscript (Jenkinson 1926: 154; Denholm-Young 1954: 77; Zeeman 1956: 11-18; Heyworth 1981: 139-140). In this vein, Parkes argued that the apparent chaos of most manuscripts is just a scribal convention whereby “scribes and correctors punctuate where confusion is likely to arise and do not always punctuate where confusion is not likely to arise” (Parkes 1978: 138-139).",0,1
"In this paper, frequency domain multi-channel noise reduction algorithms are proposed, based on the subspace decomposition of narrow-band spatial covariance matrices. In speech-present periods, the multi-channel input signals are decomposed into speech and noise spatial subspaces. The noise eigenvalues are modified in order to update the noise statistics not only in the noise-only period but also in the speech-present period. Three approaches are introduced for the noise eigenvalue modification, which are based on the rank-1 property of the speech narrow-band spatial covariance matrix for the single speech source. The proposed algorithms are tested with the simulated data and real data, and the results show that the proposed methods yield better performance compared to the conventional multi-channel Wiener filtering and the time domain subspace approaches.",0,1
"The Princeton WordNet® (PWN) is a widely used lexical knowledge database for semantic information processing. There are now many wordnets under creation for languages worldwide. In this paper, we endeavor to construct a wordnet for Pre-Qin ancient Chinese (PQAC), called PQAC WordNet (PQAC-WN), to process the semantic information of PQAC. In previous work, most recently constructed wordnets have been established either manually by experts or automatically using resources from which translation pairs between English and the target language can be extracted. The former method, however, is time-consuming, and the latter method, owing to a lack of language resources, cannot be performed on PQAC. As a result, a method based on word definitions in a monolingual dictionary is proposed. Specifically, for each sense, kernel words are first extracted from its definition, and the senses of each kernel word are then determined by graph-based Word Sense Disambiguation. Finally, one optimal sense is chosen from the kernel word senses to guide the mapping between the word sense and PWN synset. In this research, we obtain 66 % PQAC senses that can be shared with English and another 14 % language-specific senses that were added to PQAC-WN as new synsets. Overall, the automatic mapping achieves a precision of over 85 %.",0,1
"Nous soutiendrons dans cet article que, dans les langues austronesiennes ayant conserve une morphologie verbale complexe, les systemes verbaux presentant une opposition croisee entre, d'une part, un actif ou antipassif en * -um-/ * m(u)- vs un passif en * -in-/ * (n)i- vs une forme non marquee dite « ergative » et, d'autre part, des applicatifs marques par des suffixes * -i et * -an (ce dernier renouvele par * -ak°n) sont plus anciens que les systemes a 4 voix (ou « focus ») attestes dans les langues de Formose et des Philippines. La configuration « a 4 focus » de ces dernieres langues resulte d'une reorganisation du type de systeme atteste en chamorro, bugis, mori, wolio, tukang besi, etc. L'origine de cette reorganisation est a chercher dans la reinterpretation de l'infixe de passif (± accompli) * -in- en marque d'accompli indifferente a la voix, * -in-/ * ni- etant lui-meme le produit de l'amalgame entre un * n- « accompli » et un * (S)i- « passif ». La configuration « a 4 focus » est une innovation partagee des langues de Formose et des Philippines et autres (malgache, etc.), et non l'inverse. Dans une seconde partie, nous essaierons d'aller plus loin: les marques de diatheses et de voix, * -an, * -i, * -ak°n sont d'anciennes prepositions incorporees (Lemarechal 1997b), incorporation encore vivante, pour * akan, dans les langues de Sulawesi et d'Insulinde, pour * an en ponape, mokil, etc. S'il s'agit bien du meme * (-)an, dans quelle configuration une telle marque de latif a-t-elle pu etre associee a la promotion (en objet, puis en sujet) de l'autre argument typique des verbes de deplacement, l'objet deplace ? On a de bonnes raisons de penser que des constructions equivalentes de nos infinitifs et de nos completives exprimant donc des entites d'ordre superieur a un (Lyons 1977), attestees en ponape, en palau et dans des langues de Sulawesi, sont au centre de ce remaniement. L'incorporation de prepositions est encore un phenomene vivant en ponape, tandis que la regularisation en 4 focus est un processus arrive a son terme dans les langues des Philippines du type du tagalog et dans les langues de Formose. La regularisation complete de la repartition de * (i-)Su et * mu (< * m-Su) entre « 2sg » et « 2pl » n'est achevee que dans les langues de Formose (Lemarechal 2003).

"Applications of speech recognition are now widespread, but user-centred evaluation methods are necessary to ensure their success. Objective evaluation techniques are fairly well established, but previous subjective techniques have been unstructured and unproven. This paper reports on the first stage in the development of a questionnaire measure for the Subjective Assessment of Speech System Interfaces (SASSI). The aim of the research programme is to produce a valid, reliable and sensitive measure of users' subjective experiences with speech recognition systems. Such a technique could make an important contribution to theory and practice in the design and evaluation of speech recognition systems according to best human factors practice. A prototype questionnaire was designed, based on established measures for evaluating the usability of other kinds of user interface, and on a review of the research literature into speech system design. This consisted of 50 statements with which respondents rated their level of agreement. The questionnaire was given to users of four different speech applications, and Exploratory Factor Analysis of 214 completed questionnaires was conducted. This suggested the presence of six main factors in users' perceptions of speech systems: System Response Accuracy, Likeability, Cognitive Demand, Annoyance, Habitability and Speed. The six factors have face validity, and a reasonable level of statistical reliability. The findings form a useful theoretical and practical basis for the subjective evaluation of any speech recognition interface. However, further work is recommended, to establish the validity and sensitivity of the approach, before a final tool can be produced which warrants general use.",0,1

"The two-phase study reported here examined the content and communication function served by electronic bumper stickers (EBSs). EBSs consist of the sayings that are included in an e-mail signature file following personal identifiers such as one's name, phone number, and postal address. In the first phase, 334 EBSs were gathered and content analyzed into one of five message categories. In order of frequency (greatest to smallest frequency) they were: wisdom, humor, advice, religious, and socio-political commentary. In the second phase, open-ended responses from 134 EBS users were coded into one of six motives for interpersonal communication (Rubin et al., 1988). The relationship between one's motive for using an EBS and the content of one's EBS was not statistically significant. The implications of EBSs and e-mail use for mediated communication competence are considered.",0,1

"Michel Foucault (2007:313) describes how, in the seventeenth century, the term‘‘police’’ was used to describe the rational management of the state, ‘‘the set ofmeans by which the state’s forces can be increased while preserving the state ingood order’’. This rational management would be effected through the collectionand production of knowledge about the people, so as to strengthen the state. Suchknowledge would be inﬁnitely detailed, stretching into the smallest corners ofhuman conduct. And the product of policing would be ‘‘order’’. The state, as weknow, is just one actor among many regulating language behaviours in contem-porary globalised societies. Building on recent critiques of the modernist tradition inlanguage policy (e.g. Shohamy 2006; Ricento 2006; Wright 2004), we argue thatFoucault’s notion of ‘‘police’’ and ‘‘policing’’ can be fruitfully extended to cover theactivities of a wide range of actors, from the state to individuals, over civil societyand corporate actors. We propose to use the notion of ‘‘policing’’ in the domain oflanguage in this sense: as the production of ‘‘order’’—normatively organised andpoliced conduct—which is inﬁnitely detailed and regulated by a variety of actors.Our objective in borrowing this concept is to open an actor-centered ﬁeld ofinquiry into what is currently understood in terms of the top-down and bottom-updichotomy and the continuum of ‘‘overt’’ and ‘‘covert’’ language policies (Shohamy2006) in the domain of media in multilingual contexts. With this in mind, the papersin this volume propose the following conceptual shifts in examining languagepolicy:1. From ‘policy’ to the broader ﬁeld of ‘normativity’, and so to ‘policing’.Multilingual media contexts demonstrate emerging media practices andpolicing that call into question the concept of language codiﬁed in the",0,1
"Abstract Antipassives have different structural and semantic properties and are used under different conditions across languages. They also show a few universal tendencies: For instance, they generally correlate with imperfectivity. Both the diversity and the universal tendencies of antipassives have fostered a variety of analyses of this construction type in the formalist and the functional typological frameworks. In this article, these analyses will be surveyed with a view to establishing their explanatory potential and will be compared with a diachronic typological account of how antipassives diverge and what they have in common. It will be shown that at least part of this diversity finds a straightforward explanation once the sources of the antipassive are taken into account and that most of the semantic and distributional universals of antipassives are persistent features of their sources.",0,1

"Abstracta Nuestra habilidad para entender las emociones de los demás en el habla es clave para conseguir una interacción social exitosa. Estudios procedentes de varias disciplinas apuntan que la prosodia es un elemento fundamental para que este éxito se produzca. Partiendo de la premisa de que la emoción es principalmente una reacción o respuesta a un estímulo previo, en este trabajo hemos analizado si es posible establecer una relación entre el enunciado que provoca la reacción emocional (detonador) y la respuesta emocional propiamente dicha, observando el comportamiento de las magnitudes acústicas (F0, dB y VEL) en el marco de la conversación coloquial. Para ello hemos llevado a cabo dos tipos de análisis: (a) la reacción sintagmática, entendida como la reacción a lo anterior (sea a la intervención de un hablante previo o sea a la parte no emocional de la intervención de un mismo hablante); y (b) la reacción paradigmática, esto es, qué sucede con los parámetros acústicos mencionados si son cotejados con el registro medio del hablante (F0, dB, VEL). Los resultados del análisis acústico-estadístico señalan que hay regularidad y direccionalidad manifiestas en el comportamiento de la F0 en las relaciones sintagmáticas. Esta regularidad, sin embargo, no es extrapolable a las otras dos magnitudes, ni a las reacciones paradigmáticas.",0,1
"Educational assessment and marking, in particular, give teachers considerable power over students and their future possibilities. Analysing a teachers' meeting discussing school reports in a secondary school showed that marking involves teachers' accountability to colleagues. An examination of the situated interpretations and explanations of unsatisfactory school marks also showed how various discursive devices were used for building a factual account. Confirmed expectations, extreme case formulations, introducing corroborating witnesses, the deployment of cited others, defining exceptional cases, detailed descriptions and narratives, and the use of different accounts all served to emphasize the role of the students and hide the teachers from view. In addition, teachers' joint constructions had practical consequences for remedial interventions. Decisions for intervention were dependent on the accounts given.",0,1

"This paper proposes new analyses of the semantics and morphosyntactic structure of Associated Motion [AM] constructions in Kaytetye. AM constructions have been analysed as word-level constructions, with a significant non-compositional component in the semantics. We propose that these constructions are syntactic phrasal constructions with generally compositional semantics which associate a path with a predicate, and we term them Associated Path [AP] constructions. AP constructions make use of two word-level constituents in a configurational relationship: (i) a finite path auxiliary; and (ii) a participial lexical verb. Depending on the semantics of the path auxiliary and the lexical verb, AP constructions are commonly interpreted as involving motion, but motion interpretations are not an inherent requirement of the AP construction.",0,1
"Separatism, representationalism, and phenomenal intentionalism are the primary views on the relationship between the phenomenality and intentionality of experience. I defend a novel position that is incompatible with separatism, can enrich representationalism and phenomenal intentionalism, but can also be accepted independently of those views. I call it phenomenal schematics : The phenomenal characters of our experiences have structures that place a priori, formal, and sometimes semantic constraints on our experience's possible intentional contents. Phenomenal structures are like the grammar of a language (or the compositional rules governing maps, models, and diagrams). Unlike words, however, phenomenal characters possess their “grammatical properties” essentially.",0,1
"Multilingual pedagogies draw on learners’ prior language knowledge and can offer considerable advantages in learning the target language. Yet language instruction, particularly in foreign language learning contexts, does not often capitalise on the multilingual assets of learners. The goal of this study is to understand what determines the implementation of multilingual pedagogies in two institutes of German as Foreign Language, one in the US and one in India. In this comparative case study, ecological perspectives are adopted to examine what factors impede or foster the use of multilingual pedagogies in adult foreign language instruction in both schools. Data collection methods involved open-ended questionnaires, semi-structured interviews with teachers and an analysis of context-specific documents. Findings revealed that there were encouraging, constraining and contingent factors across both schools. While some factors were common to both schools, and there were other context-specific factors that determined the adoption of multilingual teaching. The results of the study also reflect larger issues such as a gap between theory and practice and a lack of teacher collaboration. The paper concludes with some suggestions on how such issues might be addressed.",0,1

"As maneiras de desenhar a prática de pesquisa, de construir um discurso sobre ela e de materializá-la no texto variam de acordo com as culturas locais de cada disciplina acadêmica, seus valores e crenças (Becher, 1981; Swales, 1990; Hyland, 2000). Em áreas duras como a física e a química, tradicionalmente se verificou uma tendência ao consenso (Kuhn, 1970), com fundamentos conceituais e procedimentais acordados entre os membros. A cultura coesa das áreas duras foi vista por Thomas Kuhn como sinal de ciência madura, pois evidenciava argumentos consensuais, verificados, testados, discutidos no coletivo da disciplina ao longo de séculos. As ciências humanas e sociais, por outro lado, têm se caracterizado pelarecência da sua organização enquanto disciplina, pela novidade de seus argumentos e pela pouca amplitude de seu consenso (Rorty, 1991). Essa natureza heterogênea da validação do conhecimento e da caracterização do objeto de estudo é vista, neste trabalho, mais como qualidade a ser saudada do que como defeito a ser excluído. Para estudar um objeto tão complexo e rico como a linguagem humana, a Lingüística Aplicada desenha procedimentos que se socorrem em outras tantas disciplinas limítrofes, como a psicologia (na pesquisa cognitivista), a antropologia (na pesquisa etnográfica) e a sociologia (na pesquisa em análise do discurso). O surgimento de diferentes possibilidades para a prática de pesquisa vem acompanhado de discussões sobre a legitimação dos problemas e procedimentos de pesquisa. Diferentes desenhos demandam, entre outras coisas, perspectivas diversas do pesquisador sobre a linguagem e como estudá-la. Este trabalho examina dois conceitos ligados a a essa questão: a perspectiva ética e a perspectiva êmica, tentando relacioná-las a diferentes modos de investigar a linguagem. Por ser de natureza complexa e rica, a linguagem demanda que acomodemos, na metodologia de pesquisa, uma 'tensão dialética' entre direções opostas. Assim, no processo de investigação, tentamos ancorar os dados no seu contexto de situação e, ao mesmo tempo, relacioná-los ao contexto mais amplo da teoria. Procuramos significação na recorrência de elementos lingüísticos e, ao mesmo tempo, buscamos explicar qualitativamente a natureza desses elementos. Desenvolvemos a habilidade de delimitar e observar um . dado contexto de pesquisa e, ao mesmo tempo, tentamos neutralizar esse olhar de fora, para penetrar nesse contexto e obter um 'olhar de dentro'.",0,1
"This paper adopts a transglossic approach to explore the ordinariness of English amongst Muslim communities in South and Central Asia. It thereby maintains that studying English as an ordinary part of these communities’ repertoires is contingent upon an approach to religion as situated, discursive, and interactive. This approach to religion is key to avoiding a paradoxical treatment of religion and language that critically examines the meaning of language without interrogating religion in the same manner. To this end, the paper uses examples from ethnographic face-to-face and online fieldwork amongst Muslim communities in Pakistan, Tajikistan, and Bangladesh to explore and rethink the relationship between religion and language. The paper concludes that religion is co-constructed and emergent in, across, and through English and other languages and semiotic resources. English is rendered ordinary in the sense that it is employed and invoked to perform religious identity in interlocutors’ everyday language practices. It is thereby used to engage in processes of positioning, and emerges as a resource that is simultaneously translocal and polyvocal, while also locally meaningful in its situated practices.",0,1

"L'ecriture de l'amour, revelant a la fois l'usure du lieu commun et son efficacite mythique, oscille toujours entre les deux poles du lyrisme et de la derision : de Crebillon fils ou Laclos a Proust et Cohen, l'auteur de Belle du seigneur, en passant par Balzac, Stendhal et l'auteur de madame Bovary, c'est cette tension qui fonde la poetique des plus grandes œuvres.

Dans cet article, nous proposons d'utiliser la notion de constructions de verbes en serie (CVS), envisagee comme un continuum 'balise' par des constructions prototypiques, pour presenter une analyse plus globale du syntagme verbal en birman. Cette nouvelle approche nous permettra de traiter ensemble des phenomenes traditionnellement analyses isolement. En outre, le birman apporte des donnees interessantes sur le phenomene des constructions de verbes en serie (CVS); il montre ainsi la non-universalite de certains criteres utilises dans d'autres langues pour definir le phenomene, et surtout l'impossibilite d'etablir des proprietes formelles generalisables a toutes les CVS et a elles seulement dans certaines langues.",0,1
"Nous analysons la production d’occlusives (non-)voisées en français langue étrangère par des apprenants plurilingues parlant ou le russe ou le turc comme langue d’origine en plus de leur langue dominante, l’allemand. Les données de contrôle proviennent d’enregistrements réalisés avec des apprenants monolingues allemands. Les résultats montrent que les apprenants plurilingues sont avantagés en comparaison des monolingues par rapport à la production d’occlusives sourdes, ce qui n’est pas valable pour leurs contreparties voisées. Cela suggère que la (non-)aspiration de /p t k/ est perceptivement plus saillante pour les apprenants que la présence ou l’absence du pré-voisement de /b d ɡ/.

"Abstract The response time and accuracy of processing verbal and nonverbal stimuli may predict the desired outcome of an event. Few studies have examined the psycholinguistic evidence of the speed-accuracy trade-off in the processing of political information to predict the outcome of an election. Therefore, we analysed the perceptual time and accuracy of two major political party names: the Indian National Congress (INC) and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and their respective symbols before the Indian election 2019. Our results demonstrated that the pre-election perceptual accuracy to party symbol and name was positively linear to the index of high proportional vote share of the winning party, BJP. The high response accuracy and time for the BJP name correlated with voters’ familiarity of it, thereby establishing a link between response results and parties’ vote shares.",0,1

"Abstract Traditional point-based grading is failing students entering a competency-based workforce: Employers require concrete skills and knowledge, not “high” grades. In the specifications approach, learning outcomes are explicitly linked to the grading system. The basic components of the approach include clear alignment of learning outcomes to certification standards, bundled sequences of assessments tied to basic and advanced competency/learning outcomes, pass/fail grading with no partial credit, opportunities to revise unacceptable work, and detailed expectations of performance on assessments. This article describes the specifications approach and provides examples highlighting how to (1) align course learning objectives with a grading system, (2) implement a pass/fail approach even for complex assessment, (3) define specifications, (4) create and sequence bundles of assessments, and (5) provide instructor support through feedback and tokens.",0,1

"Across three experiments, we studied whether the mental representations of negated concepts are suppressed. In two reading-time experiments, we tested whether the presence of a negated nonreferent distractor (e.g., Justin bought a mango but not an apple. He ate the fruit.) interfered with the process of anaphor resolution. We found evidence that highly-typical category exemplars (e.g., apple) in the negated nonreferent role interfere with anaphor comprehension; evidence regarding less-typical category exemplars was mixed. In a third experiment, participants read brief passages like those from the prior experiments and their memory for the category exemplars was tested in a surprise cued-recall task. Once again, we found evidence that negated nonreferents are considered during anaphor resolution. These results are inconsistent with a theoretical perspective that posits that negation of a concept obligatorily leads to suppression of that concept. Instead, we argue that the comprehension of negation will be dictated by its pragmatic role.",0,1
"Every day we are encountering in the news the names of ""new"" countries and peoples we were unaware of before-new but very old, often trailing very long memories of past injustices and historic feuds, in which, it seems, we should all become involved, even though the ""rights"" and ""wrongs"" in many of these situations are far from clear to us. Meanwhile we are working to come together in new and cooperative ways in larger and larger shared-interest groups. There seems to be a tug-of-war between the desire to be what one is, or at least to have our identity at the micro level recognized and respected, and the acceptance of the many benefits that come from working (and playing) together to achieve wider ends.

The analysis illustrates the discourse strategies and rhetoric of this staunchly nationalist German writer who was also Settlement Commissioner to German South-West Africa between 1903 and 1906. The texts are good examples of German nationalist propaganda of the Second Empire and were widely read at the time of their publication and afterwards. Their influence is likely to have extended to the period after the First World War, when National Socialism was inchoate.",0,1

"This paper presents and discusses the findings of a survey which examines reviews of English learner dictionaries. The focus is on various aspects, such as the identity of the reviewers and intended readers, the stated purpose, the evaluation process, the different kinds of lexicographical and linguistic information discussed, the conclusions drawn, and the tone adopted. The findings of the survey suggest that most dictionary reviews are factual and descriptive rather than evaluative, and only in some cases is the evaluation based on a principled study of any kind. It is suggested that for such reviews to be truly useful to their intended readers, they should be evaluative and that at least part of the evaluation should be based on a study of the use of the dictionary by target users. © 2001",0,1
"BOOK NOTICES 443 syntax are combined with a general overview of the Saramaccan language, is followed by a chapter on Saramaccan syntax (1 1-48). Veenstra examines the Saramaccan pronominal system, concluding that atonic subject 'pronouns' are in fact clitics residing in AGRs which license null subjects. Also studied are tense/mood/aspect particles (analyzed as auxiliaries base-generated as the heads of their respective functional categones) and anaphors. V introduces the claim that in Saramaccan and other creóle languages, the lack of verbal inflection results in the lack of Vto -INFL movement Ch. 3. 'Small clause complements ' (49-72), analyzes secondary predicates as small clauses and affirms that Saramaccan exhibits both finite and nonfinite complementation. Saramaccan serial verbs are described in Ch. 4 (73-104), and are subjected to syntactic analysis in Ch. 5 (105-151). While detecting at least three different types of serial constructions in Saramaccan, V postulates that all serial verbs result from right-adjunction, made possible by the lack of V-to-INFL movement. He adduces evidence that the verbs are base-generated in adjacent positions, while movement may result in an intervening nominal argument. Ch. 6 (153-174) describes the probable mechanisms which yielded the grammaticalization of several serial constructions, including the use of táu 'say' and mbéi 'make' as complementizers, and dá 'give' with several different functions. V argues that semantic expansion preceded syntactic reanalysis in the first two cases while syntactic category reanalysis took place before semantic extension in the last-mentioned case Ch. 7 (175-200) deals with the creolization process , attributing the rise of serial verbs to universal aspects of first language acquisition. In essence. V asserts that children hearing a pidgin which lacked verb morphology, hence V-to-INFL movement, would adopt verb adjunction as a universally unmarked option. He suggests that in the early stages of child language, semantic relations between structures are domain-insensitive. Thus, for example, children hearing a combination such as NP, V NP2 V NP3 would interpret it as two conjoined clauses, regardless of the presence of a complementizer; the conjoined clauses would then reduce to a serial verb construction. Since verb serialization in Atlantic creóles has usually been linked to a West African (particularly Kwa) substrate. V must rule out such transfer in order to bolster his universalist approach. This he does first by claiming that serial verbs occur in creóles outside of the Atlantic/West African domain, and second by noting that the specifics of verb serialization in Saramaccan do not coincide with any particular African language and in some instances go beyond what is found among Kwa languages. The claim that serial verbs are found in Seselwa, the creóle language spoken in the Seychelles, is controversial, as the author admits, and at best covers only a handful of cases. The fact remains that verb serialization is completely absent, e g. from Portuguese-based creóles in Africa and Asia and from Philippine Creole Spanish, in none of whose substrata ( known or surmised) verb serialization occurs. Creolized varieties of Swahili, KiKongo . and Arabic spoken in Africa similarly lack serial verbs. The almost complete correlation between verb serialization and a demonstrated Kwa substrate cannot be easily dismissed. V takes to task those who find mere similarity of structures between Kwa languages and Atlantic creóles sufficient evidence to posit direct grammatical transfer. His own methodology, however, is subject to the same criticism : 'some creóle languages without a Kwa substrate can have serial verb constructions. Since this is the case, there is no a prion reason to assume that serial verb constructions should be the result of transfer from West African substrate languages in creóle languages with a West African substrate' (179). Equally suspect is the logic behind the interpretation of the fact that Berbice Dutch creóle (spoken in Guyana) has more types of serial verb constructions than Eastern Ijo, its primary substratum 'you would expect the substrate language to contain the superset and the creóle the subset, but in this specific case it is reversed. If a creóle language can develop one type of serial verb construction independently of its substrate, why...",0,1
"In the contemporary U nited S tates, racism is commonly thought to be located in the hearts and minds of a particular negatively valorized social figure: the “racist.” Racist discourse is often implicit and indexical, and interracial interactions may be overdetermined by mutual “racial paranoia” ( J ackson 2008) about interlocutors' true thoughts. In this paper I argue that the reality television genre has a unique engagement with tropes of authenticity and intentionality that exploits this dynamic of suspicion. I take as an example a conflict that occurred on an episode of Survivor around comments made by a W hite southern man to an A frican A merican woman. In the scenes analyzed, racial paranoia is itself mobilized as a narrative hook. Participants prod each other to reveal the indexical meaning that they suspect is underlying each other's utterances, showing a perceived incongruence between language and intention. Casting, production, and editorial practices contribute to the dramatization of racism as interpersonal conflict. I show that interventions like sound mixing, the use of testimonial interviews, and the editorial placement of reaction shots reinscribe broader cultural oppositions between “authentic” mental states and “false” performed identities.",0,1

"The latest reference corpus of written Slovene, the Gigafida corpus, was created as part of the ‘Communication in Slovene’ project. In the same project, a web concordancer was designed for the broadest possible use, and tailored to the needs and abilities of user groups such as translators, writers, proofreaders and teachers. Two years after the corpus was published within the new tool, its features were assessed by the users. With an average rate of 4.36 on a scale between 1 and 5 (1 = I strongly disagree, 5 = I strongly agree), the results indicate that most survey participants agreed or strongly agreed with positive statements about the new implementations (e.g. “The corpus results are displayed in a clear manner”). This is a considerable improvement in user experience from the previous reference corpus of Slovene, i.e. the FidaPLUS corpus within the ASP32 concordancer (rated with 3.67). In the user feedback, the simplicity of search options and the interface clarity are highlighted as the main advantages, while for the future development, advanced visualizations of corpus data and improved search of word-phrases are suggested. The evaluation also highlighted some relevant user habits, such as not taking the time to learn systematically about the tool before they start using it. The findings will be implemented in future editions of the Gigafida corpus, but are relevant to any project that aims at facilitating a wider use of reference corpora and corpus-based resources.",0,1
"Abstract This essay presents a new account of thought insertion. Prevailing views in both philosophy and cognitive science tend to characterize the experience of thought insertion as missing or lacking some element, such as a ‘sense of agency’, found in ordinary first‐person awareness of one's own thoughts. By contrast, I propose that, rather than lacking something, experiences of thought insertion have an additional feature not present in ordinary conscious experiences of one's own thoughts. More specifically, I claim that the structure of an experience of thought insertion consists of two distinct elements: a state of ordinary first‐person awareness and a sense that this state of awareness is highly unusual. In addition to modeling the experience of thought insertion, I also explain how a delusional pattern of thinking could lead someone who has this kind of experience to adopt a belief that some other entity is inserting thoughts into her mind. Finally, I briefly sketch a neurocomputational framework that could be developed to explain the sense that one's state of first‐person awareness is highly irregular.",0,1

"This paper aims at checking the eligibility of linguistic landscaping research methods for language research from the RST perspective. Linguistic landscaping has proved, so far, to be an excellent tool for documenting and delineating social changes and different cleavages in a society (Ben-Rafael et al. 2006; Grbavac 2012a; Trumper-Hecht 2009). Linguistic landscaping is capable of depicting subtle phenomena, above all, in a multilingual and multicultural setting. Linguistic landscape, as a set of ‘in vitro’ and ‘in vivo’ signs put up by new social actors, is dynamic and purposive, in the very same manner like the agency concept in Realist Social Theory (RST). It is an “ever-shifting set of conditioning relations” (Carter and Sealey, 2014 in preparation). The paper will apply agency and structure approaches of RST on language policy, which is a variable that saturates and shapes all aspects of a linguistic landscape. This case study was done in Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina, a city that was divided after the 1992–1995 war into two parts. Today all characteristics of an unstable, rapidly changing society in transition are present in the city. The two confronted collectives have different interests, so that the linguistic landscape of the city of Mostar represents a battlefield for advancing and opposing interests. The hypothesis states that language policies that were imposed ‘in vitro’ failed to be a success in the linguistic landscape of Mostar. The characteristic features of the linguistic landscape of Mostar are the omnipresence of global English, overstated collective identity and signs with a mixture of local languages. Linguistic landscaping, as a socially situated and socioculturally conditioned activity and as a result of variegated endeavours of the actors in the linguistic landscape, supports the core claim of RST: social outcomes are the result of the interplay between agency, structure and culture. Linguistic landscape research, synchronic in its nature, could be a good tool for applying the RST postulates.",0,1

"Adopting a Systemic Functional Linguistic approach, the article investigates choices of taxis in Chinese-to-English translation. Previous studies have proposed that Chinese texts tend to favor parataxis more than hypotaxis, and translators are often advised to change the paratactic relation to hypotactic ones in the process of translation. Against such a background, two research questions are proposed: (1) what choices do professional translators actually make when translating Chinese paratactic clauses into English; and (2) how do professional translators translate Chinese hypotactic clauses into English? The data comprises texts on how China fought against COVID-19 and scientific texts extracted from a translation textbook approved by the editing committee of CATTI. Analysis reveals that there are a variety of choices available to the translators, which are discussed and consolidated into a network. Paratactic relations in the Chinese source text can be removed, retained, or changed into hypotactic relations. Hypotactic relations in the Chinese text tend to be retained, although they may also be removed. Different from the popular belief that parataxis in Chinese should be translated into hypotaxis in English, the analysis demonstrates that the choices of removing and retaining paratactic relations are more frequently made than simply changing parataxis into hypotaxis.",0,1
"Previous literature in cognitive psychology has provided data involving differences in language processing between men and women. It has been found that women are usually more proficient with certain semantic categories such as fruit, vegetables and furniture. Men are reported to be better at other categories semantic, e.g. tools and transport. The aim of this article is to provide an inquiry about possible differences in semantic category processing of living things (LT) and inanimate objects (IO) by Argentinian Spanish-speakers school-aged children. The group of 86 children between 8 and 12 years old (51.16% boys) has been assessed on a semantic fluency task. Six semantic categories have been tested, three of them from the LT domain (animals, fruit/vegetables, and body parts) and three from the IO domain (transport, clothes and musical instruments). Results showed differences in semantic processing between boys and girls. Girls retrieved more items from the LT domain and activated more animals and fruit/vegetables. These findings appear to support an innate conceptual organization of the mind, which is presumably influenced by cultural factors and/or schooling.&#x0D; References&#x0D; &#x0D; Albanese, E., Capitani, E., Barbarotto, R., &amp; Laiacona, M.

"This article reports on the Electronic Network Frequency Criterion as a means of assessing the integrity of digital audio evidence. A brief description is given of phenomena that determine ENF varaiations. In most situations,to reach a non-authenticity option, the visual inspection of spectrograms and comparison with an ENF database are enough. A more detailed investigation, in the time domaine, requires short time windows measurements and analyses. The stability of the ENF over geographical distances has been established by comparison of synchronized recordings made at different locations on the same network. A real case is presented, in which the ENF Criterios was used to investigate an audio file created with a secret surveillance system. By applying the ENF Criterion in forensic audio analysis, one can determine whether and where a digital recording has been edited, establish whether it was made at the time claimed, and identify the time and date of the registering operation.",0,1
"We present an eye-tracking study on the incremental derivation of the some-but-not-all scalar implicature (SI) associated to the scalar quantifier some. This question has been the matter of a vivid debate, both in linguistics and in psycholinguistics (Chemla & Singh 2014a,b). Experimentally, it was addressed by means of eye-tracking and different results were obtained: while Huang & Snedeker (2009) found evidence for a delay of some with respect to all, Grodner et al. (2010) argued for a rapid integration of pragmatic some. More recently, Breheny et al. (2013a,b) raised some criticism on the paradigm employed in those studies and contributed with a looking-while-listening task showing incremental derivation of the scalar inference. We first raise some methodological questions, arguing that the paradigm used in previous studies was not apt to distinguish whether a scalar inference was derived or not, for different reasons. By means of a novel visual-world eye-tracking experiment in which we exploit the notion of focus in the activation of scalar alternatives, we show new evidence for the incremental derivation of the pragmatic some-but-not-all interpretation of some. We interpret these results within a grammatical approach to SIs (Chierchia et al. 2012; Chierchia 2013), according to which, when scalar alternatives are active, the SI is factored in locally and incrementally during the on-line processing of the scalar quantifier.",0,1
"Despite decades of effort to broaden participation in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), many fields remain demographically skewed. Marginalized and minoritized people are still underrepresented in and underserved by the sciences. In this paper, the author considers the question, “How do we improve representation in STEM?” by reflecting on his own journey and themes such as imposter syndrome, decentering, meritocracy, and activism. Importantly, “underrepresentation” is not a mysterious happenstance but rather a predictable outcome of systemic inequity and systematic exclusion. By attending to the mechanisms of oppression, we can enact interventions that address root causes instead of symptoms. There are multiple ways that our research, teaching, and practice might change “the system” by making inclusion and equity the focus of our work, applying these principles to frame research questions and interpret findings, and adopting methods and practices that are inclusive and equitable.",0,1
"A persistent issue in the comparative study of Land Dayak (Malayo-Polynesian; Western Indonesian; Greater North Borneo) languages is the reconstruction of the Proto-Land Dayak vowel system. Past studies have reconstructed a distinction between ""full"" and ""reduced"" vowels in Proto-Land Dayak penultimate syllables. Although full and reduced vowels may be legitimate in certain cases, the evidence for many of the reconstructions is inconsistent with Land Dayak historical phonology and the issue is in need of a second look. Using the comparative method to identify borrowed vocabulary, the present study proposes an alternative Proto-Land Dayak vowel system which largely eliminates the full-reduced distinction from the proto-language except in a handful of cases and explains that modern full and reduced vowels are mostly the result of chronologically more recent borrowing (after the breakup of Proto-Land Dayak).",0,1

Apres avoir presente les etudes anterieures portant sur la variation lexicale en francais laurentien, nous exposons nos hypotheses, les principales caracteristiques de la communaute de Casselman, la methodologie, puis nos resultats analyses a la lumiere des recherches publiees jusqu’a maintenant. Notre objectif est de fournir des donnees provenant d’entrevues recentes, realisees aupres d’adultes et d’adolescents franco-ontariens, afin de : 1) degager les points de convergence et de divergence dans les pratiques linguistiques des Franco-Ontariens observes jusqu’a present, 2) fournir des preuves supplementaires appuyant la these de l’unite des varietes de francais laurentien, et plus globalement, 3) illustrer a nouveau l’interet des etudes lexicales en linguistique variationniste. Abstract: This study deals with the alternation in forms expressing the meanings motor vehicle and paid work in a corpus of interviews collected in the Franco-Ontarian village of Casselman. After discussing earlier studies of lexical variation in Laurentian French, we present our hypotheses, the main characteristics of the Casselman speech community, and our methodology. We then turn to our results, analysed in light of relevant published work. Our goal is to provide data from recent interviews with adult and adolescent Franco-Ontarians, in order to 1) establish points of convergence and diverence with the previously observed linguistic behaviour of Franco-Ontarians, 2) provide supplementary evidence supporting the hypothesis of Laurentian French unity, and more generally, 3) illustrate the value of lexically-based studies in variationist sociolinguistics.",0,1
"ObjectiveThe aim of this study was to investigate the effect of working memory capacity (WMC) and updating ability (UA) on listening effort measured using a new test, the Auditory Inference Span Test (AIST), as an objective measure of listening effort.DesignThe AIST is based on Swedish five-word sentences and taps into three memory load levels (MLLs). It was administered in stationary speech-shaped noise at −2, −4, and −6 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). WMC was assessed using the reading span test, and UA was assessed using the letter memory test. We also collected data on speech-in-noise performance and subjectively rated listening effort at the three SNRs.Study sampleThirty-nine participants with normal hearing thresholds (≤20 dB HL for 250 to 4000 Hz) took part in the study.ResultsAIST performance decreased with increasing MLL and was related to WMC and UA. Participants with high WMC performed better than those with low WMC at more favorable SNRs. Participants with high UA performed better than participants with low UA at the intermediate MLL, which made particular demands on the UA. Neither speech recognition scores nor subjectively rated listening effort was associated with AIST performance or either of the cognitive variables.ConclusionAIST taps into cognitive functions necessary for understanding speech in noise. However, in its current form AIST may be too cognitively taxing to successfully measure graded listening effort in participants with lower cognitive capacity.",0,1
"1. WHAT IS A RESULTATIVE VERB COMPOUND? A resultative verb compound (hereafter RV) in Mandarin Chinese is, very roughly, a compound verb made up of two parts, the first indicating an action and the second the result of that action. An example is the verb of 1, illustrated in 2:' (1) la-kai 'pull-open' (2) Ta la-kai le men 'He pull-open ASPECT door' = 'He pulled the door open.' However, this is only a rough characterization. A generally accepted diagnostic for RV's is whether they can occur in the 'potential' mode.2 The 'potential' form of an RV involves the insertion of -deor -bubetween the two parts, -deadding the meaning 'be able', -bu'be unable': (3) T ld-de-kdi m6n 'He pull-can-open door' = 'He can pull the door open.' (4) Td ld-bu-kai m6n 'He pull-can't-open door' = 'He can't pull the door open.' Other compound-verb types in Mandarin do not permit the insertion of these two morphemes; e.g., corresponding to the verb-object compound 5, there is no 6: (5) tido-wiv 'jump-dance' = 'dance' (6) *tido-de-wa, *tido-bu-wi.",0,1
"Beginning by noting the lack of precision between what is cultural appropriation and cultural borrowing, the author turns to similarly imprecise distinctions regarding linguistic appropriation. Specifically considered are imprecise, from a Marxian lens, accounts of linguistic appropriation and dispossession. The author fleshes out the Marxian roots of appropriation and accumulation by dispossession, tracing the latter back to Marx’s primitive accumulation. It is argued that neither appropriation or dispossession of language can follow from a Marxian lens. • There is a need for more precise distinctions between cultural and linguistic appropriation and borrowing. • Understanding language and culture as commodities is not theoretical consistent from a Marxian lens. • Language cannot rightly be said to be subject to appropriation or dispossession since both notions rely on understanding language as a commodity.",0,1
"Purpose To investigate the effect of female versus male speakers' voice on the ability to recognize speech in noise in two groups of sensorineural hearing-impaired listeners, one group with impairment at low frequencies and the other at high frequencies. Method Eight participants with high-frequency hearing impairments (Hf-HI) and seven with low-frequency hearing impairments (Lf-HI) participated. Sixteen normal hearing (NH) participants served as reference. The sentences from the hearing in noise test, read by a female or a male speaker, were presented monaurally with a background noise. In an adaptive procedure, the mean speech recognition threshold, for 50% correctly recognized sentences, was calculated for the female and male voice and each test subject. Results The Hf-HI group had significantly greater difference in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) results between female and male voices. Irrespective of hearing impairment, the female voice required 2.1 dB better SNR. In addition, the NH group showed a smal...",0,1
"Aims and objectives: Past research has shown that multicultural experience and multilingualism can be positively associated with creativity. However, very few studies have focused simultaneously on all these variables. Our aim is to consider both sets of predictors simultaneously, clarifying whether the impact of these variables on creativity is cumulative or redundant. Design/methodology/approach: The design combines correlational and quasi-experimental approaches. It is also strongly multivariate and includes various measurement methods. Variables of interest were assessed with questionnaires ( N = 596) and creativity tasks ( N = 174) in laboratory settings. The scope of the study, therefore, is relatively large and encompasses several indicators. Data and analysis: We use multiple regressions with latent and manifest variables. Latent variables were constructed for all sets of key predictors (multilingualism, traveling experience, living abroad experience); predictors were regressed on four types of creativity variables, also latent in most cases (creative potential; creative interests, activities, and achievements; creative performance in a writing task; creative performance on a remote association task). Findings/conclusions: Results shows that both multicultural experience and multilingualism are positively related with various manifestations of creativity. Overall, the results indicate complementary effects of multicultural experience and multilingualism on creativity. The most robust predictors are multilingualism and variables representing deep immersion in foreign countries. Originality: Three features make this study unique: (a) it examines both multilingualism and multiculturalism; (b) the sample population is broader than in most studies, which often focus on migrant populations; and (c) it implements a multimethod operationalization of creativity. Significance/implications: The paper goes beyond received approaches to the link between human diversity and creativity; the analysis is put in relation with other research work that focuses on policy implications for diversity, particularly in the areas of bilingualism and bicultural identity. Implications regarding the connections between creativity, multilingualism, and general executive functioning are also discussed.",0,1
"El presente estudio explorÃ³ la articulaciÃ³n pedagÃ³gica entre las Redes Sociales para el Aprendizaje de Lenguas (RESAL) y las clases presenciales de inglÃ©s en la licenciatura en lenguas extranjeras de una universidad pÃºblica colombiana.

"The present research examines how the usefulness of source information to explain conflicting scientific claims affects laypersons’ processing of this information as they seek possible explanations for the conflicting scientific claims in the sources and during resolution of the conflict. In an eye-tracking experiment, we presented 76 participants with two conflicting scientific claims (on a controversial nanotechnology issue) put forward by two scientists (sources) that did or did not differ in their implied trustworthiness. We expected differences in trustworthiness to be useful source information for claim evaluation and explanation of the conflict. This should lead to longer processing of the source information during reading, to a stronger explanation of the conflict through differences in the scientists’ motivations, and to stronger agreement with the claim of the source which was more trustworthy. Our results show that differences in the sources’ trustworthiness indeed led to increased visual attention to source information during reading. Moreover, the source information affected individuals’ explanation of the conflict as well as their claim agreement: Individuals in the condition with differences in trustworthiness agreed more strongly with scientists’ motivations as a potential explanation for the conflict and agreed more strongly with the claim of the more trustworthy source than the individuals in the control condition. These results are discussed in the context of the content-source integration (CSI) model.",0,1
"Abstract In a recent work, Covington discusses the enumeration of two different sets of alignments of two strings of symbols using elementary combinatorial techniques. He defines two functions a(m, n) and A(m, n) to count the number of two-string alignments in his “small” and “middle” sets of alignments (respectively). He provides a recurrence for each of these functions which allows for the calculation of values of a(m, n) and A(m, n). In this note, we obtain generating functions for each of these functions. With the generating functions in hand, we provide improvements on Covington's recurrences, making the calculation of a(m, n) and A(m, n) much more efficient.",0,1
"This paper presents the first in-depth analysis of linguistic landscape (LL) of a migrant area in Dubai. While Arabic is the official language of the country, few foreigners learn it and English has become the lingua franca that allows migrant communities to communicate. Nonetheless, English and Arabic are mother tongues to a minority of resident population. A multitude of other languages are spoken among expatriates. Despite that variety, the visibility and salience of particular languages in LL is a reflection of, most often, their differing social standing. As such, this research shows how multilingualism, language contact, social hierarchy as well as official policies with regards to language use in UAE, have led to the minimisation of third languages use in LL. Through a multilingual analysis of signs in Souk Naif area, this research provides important insights on the meaning of linguistic landscapes in cosmopolitan cities in the Arabian Gulf, specifically, how bottom-up sign makers negotiate the public space, why English is the primary language used, and finally, why high levels of multiculturalism lead to deterritorialisation and commodification of languages in LL.",0,1
"Abstract Seit einem Jahrhundert arbeitet man sich an der Ahhiyawa-Frage ab. Die Antworten bleiben vage und flüchten ins allgemein Historische. Das ist kein Wunder, denn die Frage ist falsch gestellt. Das war immer bekannt, wurde aber nie ernst genommen. Es geht überhaupt nicht um Ahhiyawa, sondern zunächst einmal nur darum, die Ausgangsform, nämlich den Ortsnamen Ahhiya, auf einer Karte zu lokalisieren. Die philologische Analyse der wenn auch spärlichen Belege für diesen legt es nahe, in Ahhiya den Namen einer Insel zu vermuten, die südlich von Lesbos vor der Küste Kleinasiens liegt. Die nächste größere Insel ist Chios. Diese Annahme von Ahhiya als ältere nichtgriechische Form der späteren griechischen Form Chios läßt sich dann sprachwissenschaftlich erhärten, indem das der Gleichung entgegenstehende anlautende a - den bekannten Beispielen angereiht wird, die einen luwischen Lautwandel zeigen, bei dem dieses unterdrückt wird. Erst nach dieser Identifizierung von Ahhiya als Insel Chios kann man sinnvoll über Ahhiyawa reden. Achäer und Ahhiyawa haben sprachlich nichts miteinander zu tun. Als Nebenergebnis ergibt sich noch, daß der Name Attarissiya eines Herrschers von Ahhiya sicher nicht ein ins Hethitische eingegliederter griechischer Atreus ist, sondern wohl umgekehrt ein ins Griechische eingegliederter nichtgriechischer Teiresias.",0,1

"Cette etude comporte deux parties: a) quelques remarques sur le pronom personnel ja de l ere personne du singulier, b) l'analyse de l'emploi du lexeme sam dans l'une de ses fonctions : determinant de ja. Les indices qui determinent l'emploi du pronom ja peuvent etre regroupes sur deux axes : a) la presence de « l'autre » et b) le « plan discursif ». Les indices degages pour le fonctionnement de ja aupres du verbe au present se revelent valables avec le verbe au passe. De plus, la presence de ja aupres du verbe au passe peut s'expliquer par la creation d'une « retrospective temporelle ». Le lexeme sam/sama/sami ne s'emploie qu'avec les noms animes ou avec les pronoms personnels. Les grammaires traditionnelles russes le considerent comme un « pronom ». Parmi les multiples significations de sam/sama/sami nous nous interesserons a « sans l'aide d'autrui ». Comme l'emploi de ja, celui de sam/sama/sami est conditionne par la relation a « l'autre ». L'expression de ce lexeme dans le theme est lie a un appel a « l'autre », alors que noyau du rheme, il sert a exclure « l'autre » de l'action.

"This article discusses the impact of the increase from the late 1980s in the frequency and number of foreign languages spoken in Japan in the judicial branch of the Japanese state. Particular attention is paid to the language barrier problem in Japan’s criminal justice process, the cause and consequences of the problem, as well as Japan’s response to it. The introduction points out that in the politics of language activated by the arrival of international labor migration, migrant receiving countries today are unable to anticipate that migrant language assimilation will occur, and that those countries — in particular Japan — need to respond to such a situation accordingly. Section 2 puts the language barrier problem into historical context to show that the problem reflects a substantial change in Japan’s international relations, and as such is a force of globalization. Section 3 reports on the legal and political implications of the problem for the contemporary Japanese state, and the immediate consequences of the problem after its revelation, namely that the legality and legitimacy of Japan’s administration of criminal justice to foreign language speakers within its jurisdiction was partially and temporarily constrained. Section 3 also presents Japan’s response to the problem, both by civil society and the state. It is argued that by introducing judicial interpretation into its criminal justice process, the Japanese state managed to recover within about a decade its capability to justify (as far as its interests in maintaining domestic order are concerned) the administration of criminal justice to foreigners in Japanese territory whose first language is not Japanese.",0,1
"Conflict Resolution and Relational Patterns in the Families of Origin of Women and Men The aim of the studies was to seek an answer to the following question: Which relationship patterns correlate with different conflict resolution strategies in women's and men's intimate relationships? The subjects were 56 engaged couples (aged 19-37) answering Conflict Resolution Strategy Questionnaires, Personal Authority in the Family System Questionnaires and The Family of Origin Scale. The network of correlations between conflict resolution strategies and relationship patterns is more complex for women than for men. In the women's group, the correlation connects constructive strategies (dialogue and loyalty) foremost with patterns defining intimacy (or its components). However, destructive strategies (exit and neglect) are related to patterns definitive of individuation levels in the family of origin, independence and position. In the men's group, however, the correlation connects conflict resolution strategies (constructive and destructive) to relationship patterns definitive of partner relations. Furthermore, constructive strategies are associated with lower intergeneration triangulation intensity and higher intergenerational intimidation intensity.",0,1
"Zusammenfassung Die Sprachpolitik, die Frankreich im 19. Jh. in den Kolonien betreibt, steht im offenen Widerspruch zu den sprachpolitischen Prinzipien der Revolution. Wenn erst die Beherrschung des Französischen die Beteiligung am gesellschaftlichen Leben ermöglicht, so werden von 1794 und besonders von 1881 an in Frankreich Bildungschancen im Prinzip für alle geschaffen. In den Kolonien Schwarzafrikas dagegen wurde eine halbherzige Bildungspolitik betrieben; die Statistiken belegen, daß nur ein verschwindend kleiner Teil der Afrikaner Schulen besuchte und über den Zugang zum Französischen die Staatsbürgerschaft erlangte, womit die ideologische Motivierung der Kolonialpolitik, die „Zivilisierung“, ad absurdum geführt wurde.",0,1

"Kaxabu is an Austronesian language of Taiwan with fewer than ten speakers, all of whom are over the age of seventy and mainly use Taiwanese Southern Min in daily life. A number of morphological changes are observed. The affixes < in > ‘perfective’ and ta- ::: -i ‘hortative’ have become fossilized and have been replaced by other more productive lexical or morphosyntactic processes. Reflexes of the Proto-Austronesian monosyllabic suffixes *-en ‘UVP’, *-an ‘UVL’, and *-i ‘IMP/DEP.UVL’ have become clitics while the disyllabic prefixes pa-ka- ‘CAUS (STAT)’ (reconstructed at the PAN level as *pa-ka-) and ma-ti- ‘wear (AV)’ now also occur as (function/content) words paka ‘cause, make’ and mati ‘wear’. The aim of this paper is to examine these morphological changes, and more specifically, affix fossilization, which constitutes the last step of grammaticalization in paradigmaticity and deaffixation, which is an instance of degrammaticalization. These two processes are quite opposite and result from two concomitant factors which are causing language change: (i) language obsolescence, which induces fossilization, and (ii) language contact with Taiwanese Southern Min, which causes deaffixation. Based on these findings, we demonstrate that Kaxabu uses syntactic processes more, and morphological processes less than other Formosan languages, and that it is changing from an agglutinating language to a more isolating language.",0,1
"English elemental ordering in a non-canonical word order incorporates preposing, postposing and elemental reversal. This paper intends to explore how these types of elemental ordering are distributed during the last two centuries by employing the Corpus of Historical American English or COHA. The findings demonstrate that preposing has been increasing apparently but still in its inceptive phase; postposing, subsuming existential there and presentational there, generally keeps plateauing with existential there dominating presentational there; and elemental reversal experiences a trend of gradual decreasing, which is attributed to the dominance in occurrences of passive with a by phrase construction over those of inversion. This research provides us with a corpus linguistic insight of exploring elemental ordering, which distinguishes itself from other researches focusing on information status.",0,1

"This article focuses on the effects of a 21-hour Romance Intercomprehension (RIC) module on the plurilingual competence in Romance languages of no prior knowledge and EFL reading comprehension skills of a group of Italian schoolchildren aged 10–11. Data were collected pre- and post-training through a simple language identification and comprehension questionnaire (within subjects, n = 19), and an EFL reading comprehension test (between subjects, RIC group n = 15; control n = 23), to answer the following questions: 1) What type of plurilingual reading strategies and competence can a short RIC module develop in a school con-text? and 2) Do the competences and strategies acquired through such a RIC course affect proficiency in EFL reading comprehension? Comparisons of pre- and post-test results indicated not only that the RIC-trained group did develop an initial level of plurilingual competence in Romance languages, but also that their EFL reading comprehension skills improved more than those of the control group. Further research is needed to substantiate these data and confirm this strategy transfer. However, alongside validating Intercomprehension methodology for quick development of plurilingual reading competence, this study seems to indicate that such competence can be extended outside a language family even in young learners.",0,1

"Abstract In my paper I would like to analyze two sections of space: natural and cultural landscape (in terms of historical geography) and their reflection in the toponymic landscape. The greater focus will be on those elements of the natural landscape (the shape of the surface, soil, flora, fauna) and cultural landscape (forms and types of settlements, defense system, administrative divisions and borders, economic organization and trade, ownership, communication and roads), which were most often recorded and most frequently used in Polish oikonymy over the centuries.",0,1
"ABSTRACT Two general principles of sexual differentiation emerge from previous sociolinguistic studies: that men use a higher frequency of nonstandard forms than women in stable situations, and that women are generally the innovators in linguistic change. It is not clear whether these two tendencies can be unified, or how differences between the sexes can account for the observed patterns of linguistic change. The extensive interaction between sex and other social factors raises the issue as to whether the curvilinear social class pattern associated with linguistic change is the product of a rejection of female-dominated changes by lower-class males. Multivariate analysis of data from the Philadelphia Project on Linguistic Change and Variation indicates that sexual differentiation is independent of social class at the beginning of a change, but that interaction develops gradually as social awareness of the change increases. It is proposed that sexual differentiation of language is generated by two distinct processes: (1) for all social classes, the asymmetric context of language learning leads to an initial acceleration of female-dominated changes and retardation of male-dominated changes; (2) women lead men in the rejection of linguistic changes as they are recognized by the speech community, a differentiation that is maximal for the second highest status group.",0,1
"Deep neural network-based speech enhancement systems have achieved promising results. However, the state-of-the-art (SOTA) models usually have too many parameters and require too much computational work to be used on devices for practical applications. In this paper, we propose a novel lightweight complex spectral mask-based neural network with a two-stage pipeline for monaural speech enhancement. The network utilizes the idea of decoupling a primary problem into several simple sub-problems, which reduces the computational burden and model parameters. Specifically, the network contains two mask-based sub-networks, i.e., CoarseNet, and FineNet, implemented in the complex domain to improve the enhancement performances progressively. The CoarseNet takes the coarse-grained compact features as input and estimates the corresponding full-band complex mask. The FineNet focuses on further removing residual noises in the low-frequency components of CoarseNet output by predicting a fine-grained mask. The transforms between coarse- and fine-scale are based on a novel learnable complex-valued rectangular bandwidth (LCRB) filter bank. Furthermore, we also propose a lightweight and general complex-valued attention mechanism to improve the modeling capability of convolutional encoder/decoder of the network and uses cross-stage skip connections (CSSC) between sub-networks to facilitate information flowing between sub-networks. Extensive experiments on two standard corpora demonstrate that our proposed approach achieves better performances over previous SOTA systems under various conditions while maintaining relatively small model sizes and low computational complexity.",0,1
"El proposito de este estudio es analizar las dificultades que surgen en la argumentacion oral en el aula al abordar problemas eticos controversiales, como es el caso de la legalizacion de la eutanasia en Chile. El corpus de trabajo esta constituido por los turnos de habla de los estudiantes que participan en un debate simulado sobre la eutanasia en una clase de Lengua Castellana y Comunicacion de tercer ano medio de un colegio particular-subvencionado de la ciudad de Valparaiso (Chile). Todo esto en el marco de la unidad de aprendizaje ‘La argumentacion’. Para mostrar los problemas que los estudiantes enfrentan a la hora de argumentar oralmente, analizamos la estructura argumentativa de sus intervenciones, utilizando el enfoque pragma-dialectico, y comparamos los argumentos esgrimidos por los estudiantes con las argumentaciones mas frecuentes que circulan en el ambito de la filosofia especializada acerca de la tematica en cuestion. Los resultados de dicho analisis evidencian los escollos que los estudiantes enfrentan para conducir una ‘discusion critica’, pero al mismo tiempo dan cuenta de un vacio en la formacion de los profesores, quienes no estan preparados para distinguir entre una argumentacion etica o deontologica y otra de tipo pragmatica",0,1
"This article contributes to the ecolinguistic research agenda in two ways: first, it introduces a distinct ecological approach to intricacies of intercultural interaction, emphasizing the multiple voices, subjectivities and historicities that meet and mesh in such encounters. Second, it introduces an ecological model of timescales that allows ecological language scientists to adopt a naturalized position in order to show how temporal patterns crisscross complex empirical data; the key word is that of temporal ranges, i.e. ranges of timescales constrained by the same organizing principle. Using this model, we describe a principled method for extracting temporal patterns, historicities and sociocultural voices in complex empirical data. Our example is “another” Thanksgiving dinner (cf. Tannen, 1984) where a German, a Russian and two Japanese women interact in a US context. Our analysis shows how past events (e.g. the spread of the Ottoman Empire, Germany and Japan during World War II, Russian–American relations during the cold war, and the election of cardinal Joseph Ratzinger as pope in 2005) become powerful constraints on the interactional dynamics between the interlocutors, as they use these events to project and mold their dialogical and social identities, vis-à-vis each other and the researcher. At the end of the article, we present an ecological view on identity, and we discuss the role of the researcher in an ecological paradigm.",0,1
"En las ultimas decadas, al compas de la creciente influencia del ingles en las lenguas modernas, han venido publicandose numerosos articulos sobre anglicismos, y, en menor medida, sobre calcos y los llamados anglicismos semanticos, pero pocas veces se ha reparado, salvo de manera superficial y esporadica, en lo que se conoce con el nombre de «pseudoanglicismos» o «falsos anglicismos».

"Since its creation in 1867, Canada is founded on a political compromise between two founding nations that gave an equal status to distinct legal traditions both expressed in two official languages. In order to fulfill these ideals, however, Canadian jurists must assimilate two legal cultures and languages, an expertise far from reach for everyday citizens, and probably even from a majority of jurists themselves! This paper aims to present in a critical manner the legal discourse surrounding the implementation of bilingualism and bijuridism in Canadian law. In our opinion, the Canadian example highlights the methodological and terminological challenges related to the recognition of two languages and legal traditions within the same legal order.",0,1
"L'analyse formelle des variantes flechies du verbe a l'indicatif aboutit a la mise en evidence de la combinaison de deux morphemes [O/(±R)] et [O/ai/a]. C'est ainsi que le conditionnel et le futur se differencient des autres temps de l'indicatif par la presence du (+R)- dont on peut postuler qu'il est commun egalement a l'infinitif- mais se distinguent l'un de l'autre par l'opposition ai/a, opposition qui differencie egalement l'imparfait du passe simple en se combinant au (–R). Ce constat eclaire de facon nouvelle la relation qui se construit entre les differents « temps » du mode indicatif. En effet, la prise en compte d'une opposition supplementaire conduit a reinterroger la predominance de la temporalite dans les analyses des « temps » de l'indicatif au profit d'une deconstruction de la combinaison des valeurs. Cette analyse permet alors de rendre compte de la diversite des effets de sens tout en evitant l'atomisation des explications temporelles, modales, aspectuelles au gre des occurrences. La premiere partie de la these s'articule autour de la relation entre cette analyse morphologique et les differentes analyses formelles du futur et du conditionnel qui ont pu etre menees auparavant. Dans un second temps, se nourrissant de la confrontation avec les analyses conceptuelles existantes de l'infinitif, du passe simple, de l'imparfait, du futur et du conditionnel, elle explore le versant semantique de l'hypothese de l'existence d'un morpheme ±R qui se combine avec un autre morpheme a/ai. Hypothese qui oblige, d'une part, a caracteriser la valeur semantique du morpheme denote par ±R et c'est le concept ±potentiel qui lui sera associe, d'autre part, a redefinir l'opposition imparfait/passe simple puisque c'est cette meme opposition qui se retrouve dans le couple futur/conditionnel. C'est le trait ± defini qui sera propose. La prise en compte de la combinaison de ces deux traits semantiques permet de dejouer la complexite d'enonces dont la richesse n'a d'egal que la variete.",0,1
"This paper critically revisits and examines the seemingly outdated concept of the ‘Third World’ by tracing its historical origins with reference to the Three Worlds Theory, and investigates the reasons for the persistent implied or direct usage of the term in public and scientific discourse when referring to contexts which are typically considered to be underdeveloped. Of particular interest is the way in which knowledge production in German Studies functions in an African context which, as is argued, is influenced by complex relations that straddle the divide between a so-called “Western” and a so-called “African” perspective of the African continent, given that these perspectives are essentially determined by asymmetrical relations of wealth and power. To this end, the paper evaluates the self-perception of two academic journals in the field of German Studies published in West Africa and Southern Africa, respectively, by querying whether they participate in the postcolonial project of ‘writing back’ or rewriting colonialism in order to develop a new understanding of their participation in knowledge production.",0,1
"This study explores language practices of the Blang people and their perceptions of the changes in language ecology through the lens of chronotopes, hoping to better understand patterns of language shift in the Blang community in China. It takes a qualitative approach and draws on semi-structured interviews and ethnographic observations conducted in the Blang Mountain Township, Yunnan province, China. The study reveals that the Blang community has been undergoing a gradual shift from Blang to Chinese, and the decline of Blang has been most noticeable amongst the younger generation. This study uses a narrative approach with a focus on chronotopization in narratives to explore language shift. It contributes to our understanding of the way participants position themselves vis-a-vis the decline of their native tongue in the changing language ecology. Their accounts reveal the dynamic dialogic interrelationship between structure (conceptualised as external pressures) and agency (conceptualised as individuals’ freedom of action). The study contributes to the methodology of using chronotopes in sociolinguistic research.",0,1
"1 56Reviews Slovník slovenskych nárect. [Dictionary of Slovak Dialects.] Ivor Ripka and others. Computerization: Vladimir Benko and others. Vol. 1, A-K. N.p.: Veda, 1994. Pp. 993. No price available. From 1968 to 1984 Slovak linguists succeeded in publishing the Slovak Linguistic Atlas.1 Copious material was collected in the preparation of this work through questionnaires, field trips to the respective dialectal areas, and excerption of dialectal texts. This material was so extensive that the whole of it could not be used in cartographic representation. Slovník slovenskych nárecí is a differential dictionary that presents features that differentiate dialects revealed in the Slovak Linguistic Atlas and identify them as different from the standard language, insofar as such features appear in lexical units. Therefore, the meaning of the headwords is represented mainly by giving their equivalents in Standard Slovak. If necessary, descriptive explanations are supplied in addition to the equivalents, or in some cases, in their stead, if there are no appropriate equivalents. Slovak dialects belong to three basic groups, geographically distributed and designated — Western, Central, and Eastern. (The standard language is based on the central dialects.) If a word or one of its senses appears in all the regional groups, it is labeled as pandialectal. If it is present in the majority of the dialects or one or two groups, it is labeled by the designation of the group(s). So for instance, ceresniar 1 'who grows and sells cherries' is labeled as pandialectal, but sense 2 'cherry thief is labeled as belonging to the dialect of Trnava, in the Western group. Ceresnica 1 'cherry liqueur' is labeled as Central, whereas ceresnica 2 'a sort of medicinal herb' is labeled as belonging to the dialect of Prievidza in the Central group. Entries contain not only such labels and definitions but also a wealth of contextual examples. The provenience of each is indicated down to the village in which it was encountered , if possible. If such a village is not well known, the county in which it is located is indicated. Naturally, this degree of detail requires some information about the geography of Slovakia, which is supplied by two maps, one on the front endpaper and one on the back endpaper. The latter map gives the location of the counties of Slovakia, designated by the abbreviations of the names of the administrative centers given in the general list of abbreviations. The first map gives the location and the boundaries of the individual dialects and their three basic groups. Interpreting these maps requires special information too, because there are territories left unlabeled in various peripheral areas of SIo1J .

These are the areas in which several minority languages are spoken — Polish in the northwestern and northern areas, Ruthenian in the northeast, and Hungarian in the south. Characteristic of the microstructure of the entry is the inclusion of ""bound collocations,"" which are those whose meaning is deducible from the meanings of the constituents, and ""phraseologized"" bound collocations, i.e., those whose meaning is not deducible from the meanings of the constituents. The first are preceded by a rhombus-shaped bullet, the second by a round bullet. The headword is followed by its variants, if any exist. Most of them are cross-referenced, e.g., dúzni, whose variant dlzny'having a debt', can be found in its place in the alphabetical sequence. There are, however, some deviations from this principle, e.g., dlustvo, variant of dlzstvo, is not cross-referenced at all. This latter entry is also interesting in that the form of the headword, dlzstvo, is not attested; it seems to be used only to get its only variant, dlustvo, into the series of other words connected with 'debt', whose headwords have the form dlz-. In the same entry for dlzstvo...",0,1
"The form whose main function is to express indirect commands, called the third person Imperative, Jussive or Exhortative, when compared to the prototypical (second person) Imperative, shows semantic and formal similarities and distinctions at the same time. The study describes formal and functional patterns of Jussive and places this category within the typology of the related categories, such as Imperative and Optative, based on data from six East Caucasian languages (Archi, Agul, Akhvakh, Chechen, Icari and Kumyk). Five formal patterns of Jussive are attested in these languages, including a specialized form, constructions derived from want, from tell him to do and from make him do and the Optative. Jussive forms may express such meanings as third person command, indirect causation, permission, indifference towards the accomplishment of an action and an assumption. While the Jussive is crucially different from the second person Imperative in that it introduces a third participant, this article shows that it is the addressee, not a third person, who is the central participant of a Jussive situation from both formal and functional points of view.",0,1

"This paper investigates the place of Vietnamese in the binary NP/DP typology as formulated by Bošković (2005, 2008, 2009, 2010). Vietnamese patterns with NP languages when it comes to its lack of a genuine definite determiner, the presence of radical pro-drop, and its lack of number morphology, but it patterns with DP languages when it comes to the presence of TP, subject expletives, and subjectobject extraction asymmetries. The mixed status of Vietnamese suggests that the difference between article and article-less languages might not be as straightforward or clearcut as Bošković claims. In fact, the way these properties pattern in Vietnamese reveals that there are at least three smaller parameters (nominal, clausal, and quantificational) at stake, not just the presence or absence of DP, and that these three are independently fixed as [–DP], [+TP], and [–movement], respectively. Also important is the fact that Vietnamese is a topic-prominent language.",0,1
"von Fintel (Curr Stud Linguist Ser 36:123–152, 2001) and Gillies (Linguist Philos 30(3): 329–360, 2007) have proposed a dynamic strict conditional account of counterfactuals as an alternative to the standard variably strict account due to Stalnaker (Studies in logical theory, Blackwell, London, 1968) and Lewis (Counterfactuals, Blackwell, London, 1973). Von Fintel’s view is motivated largely by so-called reverse Sobel sequences, about which the standard view seems to make the wrong predictions. (The other major motivation is data surrounding so-called negative polarity items, which I do not discuss here.) More recently Moss (Noûs 46(3):561–586, 2012) has offered a pragmatic/epistemic explanation that purports to explain the data without requiring abandonment of the standard view. So far the small amount of subsequent literature has focused primarily on the original class of cases motivating the strict conditional view. What is needed in the debate is an examination of the predictions of the dynamic strict conditional account for a broader range of data. I undertake this task here, presenting a slew of cases that are problematic for the strict conditional view but not for Moss’s view, and considering some possible responses. Ultimately I take my contribution to constitute a significant blow to the dynamic strict conditional view, though not a decisive verdict against it.",0,1
"Joseph Harold Greenberg William Croft Joseph H. Greenberg, one of the most original and influential linguists of the twentieth century, died at his home in Stanford, California, on May 7th, 2001, three weeks before his eighty-sixth birthday.1 Greenberg was a major pioneer in the development of linguistics as an empirical science. His work was always founded directly on quantitative data from a single language or from a wide range of languages. His chief legacy to contemporary linguistics is in the development of an approach to the study of language—typology and univerals—and to historical linguistics. Yet he also made major contributions to sociolinguistics, psycholinguistics, phonetics and phonology, morphology, and especially African language studies. Joe Greenberg was born on May 28th, 1915, in Brooklyn, New York, the second of two children. His father was a Polish Jew and his mother, a German Jew. His father’s family name was originally Zyto, but in one of those turn-of-the-century immigrant stories, he ended up taking the name of his landlord. Joe Greenberg’s early loves were music and languages. As a child he sat fascinated next to his mother while she played the piano, and he asked her to teach him. She taught him musical notation and then found him a local teacher. Greenberg ended up studying with a Madame Vangerova, associated with the Curtis Institute. Greenberg even gave a concert at Steinway Hall at the age of fourteen, and won a citywide prize for best chamber music ensemble. But after finishing high school, Greenberg chose an academic career instead of a musical one, although he continued to play the piano every evening until near the end of his life. Greenberg’s fascination with languages began equally early. He went to Hebrew school, which offered only an elementary education in Hebrew, essentially how to read the script. But Greenberg got hold of a Hebrew grammar and taught himself the language. He studied Latin and German at James Madison High School. He had a friend at the Erasmus High School who studied Classical Greek, but James Madison High School didn’t offer Greek. He learned as much Greek as he could from a parallel-text edition of Sophocles’s plays and the etymologies of the Oxford dictionary, and asked his father if he could transfer to Erasmus High School. They went to see the principal, who asked Joe why he wanted to study Greek, Joe simply said ‘I’d like to study Greek’, and the principal refused his transfer. On the way home Joe cried and his father took him into town and bought him a Greek grammar and dictionary from a used-book store. So he taught himself Greek—in fact, that was the usual way he learned languages. When Greenberg began college at Columbia in 1932, he continued Latin and Greek and taught himself Classical Arabic. He also signed up for classes in obscure languages such as Akkadian and various Slavic languages, annoying professors who thought they could get away without teaching by offering classes they thought nobody would take. [End Page 815] Joe discovered comparative linguistics in his junior year and anthropology in his senior year. In his senior year he also audited a class given by Boas on American Indian languages, and on his own read all the Native American language grammars in Boas 1911, 1922. Because of his Classical and Semitic background, Greenberg entertained the idea of becoming a medieval historian specializing in contacts between Christianity and Islam in Africa. But opportunities in the humanities in the Depression were nonexistent, and his anthropology professor, Alexander Lesser, suggested he apply for a Social Science Research Council Ph.D. grant to study under Melville Herskovits, a major Africanist at Northwestern University, and obtained references for him from Boas and Ruth Benedict. Greenberg received the grant and studied with Herskovits at Northwestern. In his third year he did fieldwork among the Hausa in Nigeria (learning Hausa in the process), and wrote a dissertation on the influence of Islam on one of the few remaining non-Islamic Hausa groups. Greenberg’s intellectual interests continued to expand. Herskovits encouraged him to spend his second year at Yale (1937...",0,1

"To compare pulse oximetry (PO) levels during swallowing in healthy adults and adults with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Participants included two groups of 60 healthy adults, balanced for gender. The young group ranged from 18 to 38 years, and the older group from 60 to 87 years. In addition, there were 11 participants with COPD aged 43 to 82 years. PO levels were collected as each participant swallowed 10 mL of water, 10 mL of applesauce, and a piece of diced pear (three trials each). Analyses for the healthy groups revealed neither statistically significant main effects for bolus type nor interactions between gender and age. For between-subject effects, there was no main effect for gender, but there was a large main effect for age, and a gender and age interaction. In the group with COPD, there were no significant differences across bolus types; however, PO measures were consistently lower than the healthy groups for all bolus types. Healthy adults exhibited stable PO levels across bolus types. Adults with COPD, although exhibiting significantly lower PO levels, also remained stable. For clinicians who monitor PO measures, these results offer a more comprehensive understanding of the nature of these measures during swallowing in these groups.",0,1
"Many patients with acquired brain injury have acute impairments in declarative memory, the memory system responsible for learning facts and remembering events, whereas implicit memory for skills, habits, and emotional associations remains intact. The combination of impaired declarative memory and preserved implicit memory has implications for communicating with patients in inpatient rehabilitation, not only in therapy sessions but also in nontherapy interactions with rehabilitation staff. The aim of this study was to describe communication patterns among inpatients with declarative memory impairments and rehabilitation staff members during the early stage postinjury. Participants were five adults with acquired brain injury and declarative memory impairments. Each participant was observed for a full inpatient rehabilitation day. Results showed that staff and visitors frequently asked participants declarative questions to which answers were not verifiable (e.g., questions about preinjury events). Answers that could be verified often were incorrect but were accepted by staff as correct. Results suggest that acute rehabilitation staff may need training in communicating with patients with declarative memory impairments. We suggest strategies to create a more supportive communication environment for inpatients with memory impairment.",0,1

"Swearing produces effects that are not observed with other forms of language use. Thus, swearing is powerful. It generates a range of distinctive outcomes: physiological, cognitive, emotional, pain-relieving, interactional and rhetorical. However, we know that the power of swearing is not intrinsic to the words themselves. Hence, our starting question is: How does swearing get its power? In this Overview Paper, our aim is threefold. (1) We present an interdisciplinary analysis of the power of swearing (‘what we know’), drawing on insights from cognitive studies, pragmatics, communication, neuropsychology, and biophysiology. We identify specific effects of swearing, including, inter alia: emotional force and arousal; increased attention and memory; heightened autonomic activity, such as heart rate and skin conductance; hypoalgesia (pain relief); increased strength and stamina; and a range of distinctive interpersonal, relational and rhetorical outcomes. (2) We explore existing (possible) explanations for the power of swearing, including, in particular, the hypothesis that aversive classical conditioning takes place via childhood punishments for swearing. (3) We identify and explore a series of questions and issues that remain unanswered by current research/theorising (‘what we don’t know’), including the lack of direct empirical evidence for aversive classical conditioning; and we offer directions for future research.",0,1

"The present study investigates the multiple constraints on the processing of English dative alternation by Chinese EFL (English as a Foreign Language) learners. The intermediate and advanced learners completed an acceptability judgment task which was composed of 30 dative alternations selected from a spoken corpus. The results showed that the intermediate learners were constrained by only one predictor (pronominality of Recipient), whereas the advanced learners were constrained by eight predictors, including animacy of Recipient, syntactic complexity, pronominality of Theme, pronominality of Recipient, person of Recipient, number of Theme, concreteness of Theme as well as preemption. The results demonstrated that the advanced learners were sensitive to multiple constraints when they processed the dative alternation, but the intermediate learners were not. Our findings imply that L2 learners’ sensitivity toward multiple constraints increased as their L2 proficiency improved.",0,1
"Metaphor theory bears many implications for counseling processes, but metaphor in extended counseling talk is seldom evaluated. This article reports an exploratory skin conductance and discourse analysis of metaphorical versus literal communication styles in facilitating affective engagement over time. After background interaction with the counselor-experimenter, role-playing clients (N = 60) were asked either a metaphorical or literal stimulus question related to the topic of academic problems. This was followed by spontaneous elaboration of either stimulus. A mixed-effects model with random subject intercepts suggests that both styles are tied to increased affective engagement, but the increase was significantly more apparent in the metaphorical style. However, no significant differences were found immediately after stimulus. The results are corroborated by a post-experiment survey where the metaphorical style was rated significantly better for expressing emotions and experiences and introducing new frames of reference. A further exploratory analysis of discourse features uncovered key components of the metaphorical style and their specific implications for engagement. The study suggests that a metaphorical style is more affectively engaging but requires sustained follow-up and spontaneous metaphor elaboration skills. Limitations are critically discussed, given the infancy of the present approach.",0,1

"It has long been noted that in early Irish society there appear to be seven-fold divisions of status within the classes of freemen and filid ('seers' or 'poets') which seem to be in imitation of the seven Holy Orders of the Church. The division of the clergy into seven grades is evidenced at least as early as the third century. They were normally: porter, lector, exorcist, acolyte, sub-deacon, deacon and priest. The bishop was not usually considered to be sufficiently distinct from the priest to rank as a separate order.",0,1
"El objeto de este artículo es doble: por un lado, dar cuenta del enorme y creciente número de formaciones derivadas a partir de anglicismos que tienen lugar en el español europeo actual; por otro, examinar los distintos patrones derivacionales encontrados, así como las variaciones morfofonológicas, morfológicas y semánticas que conllevan. El artículo aborda, además, el tratamiento lexicográfico seguido en los diccionarios a la hora de dar entrada a este tipo de neologismos.

"ResumenEl presente artículo constituye un estudio del sistema de tiempo, modo y aspecto en las lenguas criollas habladas en Haití, Jamaica y las islas de Aruba, Curaçao y Bonaire. La investigación muestra cómo el sistema de TMA del haitiano, el jamaicano y el papiamento se han desarrollado. Asimimo, plantea como hipótesis que su formación implica tanto a las lenguas superestrato como a las lenguas substrato en un proceso guiado por universales del lenguaje. Adicionalmente, sostiene que no todos los aspectos de los sistemas TMA se derivan simplemente de las lenguas contribuyentes, sino que son el resultado de la interacción entre procesos de adquisición del lenguaje y la criollización.Palabras clave: criollo, criollización, adquisición del lenguaje, haitiano, jamaicano, papiamento AbstractThis paper constitutes a study of the system encoding tense, mood and aspect in the creole languages spoken in Haiti, Jamaica, and the islands of Aruba, Curaçao and Bonaire. The research shows how the TMA system of Haitian, Jamaican and Papiamento has been developed and hypothesizes that creole formation involves several degrees of input from both superstrate and substrate languages in a process guided by language universals. Furthermore, it argues that not all aspects of the TMA systems are simply derived from the source languages but result from the interaction between language acquisition and creole development.Keywords: creole, creolization, language acquisition, Haitian, Jamaican, Papiamento",0,1

"Abstract Housing that is affordable and appropriate is a necessity for successful integration for all newcomers. It is not uncommon for newcomers to Canada to report difficulties finding suitable, safe, and affordable housing for their families. For refugees, however, the challenges are sometimes greater. Settlement organizations and refugee sponsors experience various challenges in accommodating families with large numbers of children, but as our research shows, refugee groups have differing needs based on their culture, family composition, and experience of trauma. Using data collected from two recent studies, we identify and compare the housing needs of two newly arrived groups of refugees to Canada: Syrians and Yazidis from northern Iraq. All participants in our study have lived in Canada for 2 years or less and currently live in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, or Ontario. Data was collected either by face-to-face surveys (with Syrian participants) or unstructured interviews (with Yazidi women) conducted in Arabic, Kurmanji, or English. We discuss their experiences of living in resettlement centers and their transition to independent housing. In addition, we discuss how family composition and previous trauma influence their housing experiences with special attention to how increasing agency increases satisfaction with housing.",0,1

"A parallel distributed processing (PDP) model of phonological processing is developed, including components to support repetition, auditory processing, comprehension, and language production. From the performance of the PDP reading model of Plaut, McClelland, Seidenberg, and Patterson (1996), it is inferred that the acoustic–articulatory motor pattern associator that supports repetition provides the basis for phonological sequence knowledge. From the observation that many patients make phonemic paraphasic errors in language production, as in repetition, it is argued that there must be a direct link between distributed concept representations (lexical semantic knowledge) and this network representation of sequence knowledge. In this way, both lexical semantic and phonotactic constraints are brought to bear on language production. The literature on phonological function in normal subjects (slip-of-the-tongue corpora) and in patients with aphasia is critically reviewed from this perspective. The relationship between acoustic and articulatory motor representations in the process of phonetic perception is considered. Repetition and reproduction conduction aphasia are reviewed in detail and extended consideration is given to the representation of auditory verbal short-term memory in the model. Finally, the PDP model is reconciled with information processing models of phonological processing, including that of Lichtheim, and with current knowledge of the anatomic localization of phonological processing. Although no simulations of the model were run, a number of simulation studies are proposed.",0,1
"Drawing from research on racial formation processes in discourse concerning immigrants to Italy, this article argues that when racializing discourses are introduced as unmarked in a conversation, the coparticipant is put in a position of having to readily agree or openly disagree—with the second option endangering face. Racializing discourses introduced as unmarked thus tend to obtain acquiescence from the coparticipant. At the same time, they work at constructing shared identities around racist and racializing stances, where the unmarking becomes indexical of such shared identities. Instead of seeing racism as a stable belief in the mind of the individual, my analysis suggests that we should consider it as something the person does in interaction. The requirements of conversational rules of engagement, the needs of face, the relationship among the interactants, as well as their moral view, influence the participants' response to racializing discourses in interaction, and whether they might coconstruct or oppose them.

"Though intonation has many ties to the central arbitrary manifestations of human language - to syntax, phonology, and to some extent lexicon - its most intimate connections are with the general scheme of iconic nonverbal communication, particularly the now spontaneous, now simulated or ritualized, gestures of the face, head, hands and body. Its meanings are based on inferences from concepts of up and down often associated with actual up-down movements in other parts of the gestural complex - plus metaphorical extensions of those concepts. Supposed grammaticizations are contradictory unless seen as intersections of two relatively autonomous systems: word-based language, and intonational and physical gesture. The study uses evidence from the intonation of English.",0,1

"There is a long-standing debate in the literature about the benefits that acoustic components of Infant Directed Speech (IDS) might have for infants’ language acquisition. One of the highly contested features is vowel space expansion, which refers to the enlargement of the acoustic space between the corner vowels /i, u, a/ in IDS compared to Adult Directed Speech (ADS). Some evidence indicates that vowel space expansion in IDS facilitates infants’ speech perception, thus promoting language development, whereas other studies have questioned these benefits and have proposed that any processing benefits of IDS are due to its other prosodic features such as exaggerated and variable pitch. This study aimed to tease apart the effects of vowel space expansion and prosodic exaggeration in IDS on 18-month-old infants’ speech processing. Using a looking-while-listening paradigm, two between-subjects conditions were compared: Exaggerated Pitch (with exaggerated pitch height and range, but without vowel space expansion) and Expanded Vowel Space (with vowel space expansion, but no exaggeration in pitch height and range). Our results showed that infants recognized the meanings of the words more accurately in the Expanded Vowel Space compared to the Exaggerated Pitch condition. This suggests that vowel space expansion in IDS facilitates infants’ lexical processing even when it does not cooccur with the prosodic exaggeration typical of IDS.",0,1
"Adjectives express properties, is the traditional opinion, be it properties an individual has itself (absolute properties) or properties that it has only in relation to others (relative properties or relations). I shall show in this paper that most properties are not expressed by adjectives, rather they are denoted by them in what I call “thematic dimensions”. Properties are expressed by thematic dimensions and adjectives together. Adjectives can be used in predicative, adnominal, adverbial, or adsentential position and function. Besides elaborating the notion of ‘thematic dimension’ and explaining the relationship between properties and these dimensions, an aim of this paper is to assign suitable semantic types to adjectives and the ‘thematic dimensions’ they are used in. These serve for forming conjunctions and other combinations of thematic dimensions, and for forming conjunctions of expressions in several categories. These operations form the basis for the construction of properties under perspectives, i.e. in thematic dimensions.",0,1

"For thirty years, Australian Aboriginal witnesses have been subjected to varying degrees of oppression in land claim and native title cases. Each legal arena requires Aboriginal witnesses to demonstrate their traditional connections to Aboriginal land. Some witnesses appear reticent or even inarticulate, despite their actual, considerable knowledge of Aboriginal traditions. However, there are also highly acculturated Aboriginal witnesses; ironically, such witnesses may be criticized by opposing counsel essentially for their Anglo-Australian cultural literacy, so that such witnesses will be depicted as not, or less, “traditional” than their less acculturated counterparts and, therefore, have their status as Aboriginal traditional owners of land discounted—or at least questioned. For these vulnerable witnesses, there is a Catch-22 cleavage: if you are articulate, you appear less traditional; if you are inarticulate, you may appear traditional, but it is difficult for the tribunal to assess your claim to traditional ownership of land.",0,1
"As genetic testing for the presence of potentially health-affecting mutations becomes available for more genetic conditions, many people will soon be faced with the decision of whether or not to have a genetic test. Making an informed decision requires an understanding and evaluation of the arguments for and against having the test. As a case in point, this paper considers argumentation involving the decision of whether to have a BRCA gene test, one of the first commercially available genetic tests. First, argumentation in a five-page patient brochure from a for-profit company that provides BRCA gene testing, is analyzed. Next, for comparison, argumentation on BRCA testing in materials for healthcare consumers written by a not-for-profit health plan and a government organization, is analyzed. In view of the challenges identified by considering these examples, this article discusses how argumentation-oriented computer systems may be able to help the healthcare consumer to make informed decisions about genetic testing.",0,1
"This study investigates two concurrent phenomena—’imala and rounding—in the Arabic variety spoken in the Syrian village of Oyoun Al-Wadi. ’Imala refers to the use of [e] and [e:] in place of the urban vowels [a] and [a:] respectively; rounding refers to the use of [o] and [o:] in place of the urban vowels [a] and [a:] respectively. The use of two different vowels for each urban vowel is explained morphophonologically. The study economically proposes two phonological rules to account for ’imala and rounding and shows that only one rule can apply per word, to the final syllable of a word. In light of Lexical Phonology theory, certain morphological patterns and suffixes explain the presence of ’imala in initial syllables and in environments that induce rounding. That is, it is part of the lexical representation of a morphological pattern or suffix in the lexicon. Hence, ’imala could occur in the initial syllable as part of the morphological pattern, and rounding could occur in the final syllable of the same word as a result of a post-lexical phonological rule.",0,1

"In this article, I discuss Finnish case alternation adpositions from a theoretical and corpus perspective. First, I argue that postpositional PP constructions with genitive case denote the standard spatial meaning of which an extension is marked with partitive case. Also, I show how word order interacts with case assignment. Both findings are formalized in a bidirectional Optimality Theoretic framework. Second, I show that case alternating behavior does not occur unrestrictedly in newspaper corpora. Adpositions in principle tend to assign the same case to the same object over and over again, and only a small subgroup of highly frequent nouns is assigned both genitive and partitive case by the same adposition(s). This suggests that (adpositional case) alternations are only allowed for highly frequent constructions.",0,1
"This article reports the results of a meta-analysis of the effectiveness of peer-mediated learning for English language learners. Peer-mediated learning is presented as one pedagogical tool with promise for interrupting a legacy of structural and instructional silencing of culturally and linguistically diverse students. Oral language (n = 13) and written language (n = 28) outcomes were analyzed, and main effects analyses indicate that peer mediation is highly effective at promoting both oral (g = .578, p = .000) and written language (g = .486, p = .000). A number of moderator analyses were conducted, and study-quality variables were the most important moderators across outcome types. Importantly, qualitative analysis of moderator variables provides tentative evidence that peer-mediation was more effective the more that students' L1 was used for instruction, and ELLs performed better in unsegregated environments where they had both language support services and access to native-English-speaking peers.",0,1

"The enactment of theoretical contribution in research articles (RAs) is a critical academic writing practice for showcasing the scientific progress of a disciplinary field. To decide how novel research strengthens a discipline’s current state of knowledge necessitates evaluating the new empirical results based upon its specific academic norms. Yet the academic values utilized to formulate theoretical advancement have been little studied in the literature. Drawing upon pertinent evaluation frameworks, the purpose of this study is to uncover how RA authors negotiate the theoretical value of novel research by conducting a rhetorical analysis of 60 research article discussion sections taken from four prestigious management journals. The present investigation reveals a tentative taxonomy of six rhetorical appeal types deployed by RA authors to articulate the value of novel research in the knowledge market. The widespread use of these appeals in management research article discussion sections indicates that a strong promotional orientation is prevalent in the rhetoric of the journals examined. The findings of this research have theoretical and pedagogical implications for academic evaluation and promotion, as well as for teaching academic writing",0,1
"Children with Developmental Language Disorder (DLD) have difficulties acquiring the grammatical rules of their native language. It has been proposed that children’s detection of sequential statistical patterns correlates with grammatical proficiency and hence that a deficit in the detection of these regularities may underlie the difficulties with grammar observed in children with DLD. Although there is some empirical evidence supporting this claim, individual studies, both in children with and without DLD, vary in the strength of their reported associations. The aim of the present study is therefore to evaluate the evidence for the proposed association. This is achieved by means of (a) a conceptual replication study on 35 children with DLD and 35 typically developing children who performed the serial reaction time task and a test of grammatical proficiency and (b) a meta-analysis over 19 unique effect sizes, which collectively examined the serial reaction time task – expressive grammar correlation in 139 children with DLD and 573 typically developing children. Both outcomes provide no evidence for or against the existence of the proposed association. Neither do they provide evidence for a difference in the strength of the association between both groups of children.",0,1

"espanolEl objetivo de nuestro trabajo es mostrar que, debido a su significado fundamentalmente procedimental, las particulas discursivas son unidades linguisticas que funcionan como instrucciones para guiar ostensivamente al oyente en el procesamiento de la informacion.

Results, based on these experiments, provide empirical evidence that allows supporting three theoretical arguments concerning discourse particles: a) discourse particles are not irrelevant devices in communication (cfr. § 2.1); b) discourse particles have a mainly procedural meaning (cfr. § 2.2); and c) the processing patterns to which discourse particles give rise in utterances depend on the interaction of two factors: the properties of discourse particles themselves and the properties of the utterances in which they occur (cfr. § 2.3)",0,1

"One of the essential problems of auditory processing in noisy real-world environments is that the number of sound sources is greater than that of microphones. To model this situation, we try to separate three simultaneous speeches by two microphones. This problem is difficult because well-known techniques with microphone arrays such as the nullforming and beamforming techniques and independent component analysis (ICA) require in practice three or more microphones. This paper reports the effects of increasing modalities in recognizing three simultaneous speeches with two microphones. We investigate four cases; monaural (one microphone), binaural (a pair of microphones embedded in a dummy head), binaural with ICA, and binaural with vision (two dummy head microphones and two cameras). The fourth method is called “Direction-Pass Filter” (DPF), which separates sound sources originating from a specific direction given by auditory and/or visual processing. The direction of auditory frequency component is determined by using the Head-Related Transfer Function (HRTF) of the dummy head and thus the DPF is independent for the number of sound sources i.e. it does not assume the number of sound sources. With 200 benchmarks of three simultaneous utterances of Japanese words, the quality of each separated speech is evaluated by an automatic speech recognition system. The performance of word recognition of three simultaneous speeches is improved by adding more modalities, that is, from monaural, binaural, binaural with ICA, to binaural with vision. The average 1-best and 10-best recognition rates of separated speeches attained by the Direction-Pass Filter are 60% and 81%, respectively.",0,1

"In a forensic authenticity examination of an audio recording, being able to prove a recording is an original or some form of copy is of paramount importance. This article reports on a method to detect if a digital recording has been copied using an analogue interface between recording systems. Making a number of initial assumptions about the recorded signals and recording systems, it will be shown that in its simplest form, recorded digital audio data may be considered to be an acoustic signal added to white noise and convolved with the low-pass response of the recording system. This allows an estimate of the magnitude squared transfer function of the low-pass response of the recording system to be made purely from the recording under analysis. The application of a novel transform to the estimate leads to a single parameter descriptor, and when the make and type of recorder are known, this parameter value distinguishes between an original recording and a copy recording.",0,1
"In 1988, members of the American deaf community protested the appointment of a hearing person as the president of Gallaudet University, the world's only university for deaf and hard of hearing students. After a week of protest, the university's board of trustees capitulated and bowed to all the protester's demands. As the protesters engaged in a variety of demonstrations and other public events, they were joined by dozens of American Sign Language/English interpreters, who worked to ensure communication between activists, journalists, members of the university's administration, the police, and others. In this paper, I use a case method approach and analyze archival and interview data to describe the provision of interpreting services in the protest. I employ concepts from social movement studies and contentious politics to contextualize the experiences of the interpreters. Using archival and interview data, I elucidate patterns in their experiences and provide a holistic description of their organization, work, and challenges.",0,1
"ONE OF THE main elements of Trevor Johnston's thoughtprovoking article W(h)ither the Deaf Community? Population, Genetics, and the Future of Australian Sign Language is his deep concern for the future viability of Auslan as a living language. In light of the impact of scientific and technological on the Australian signing Deaf community, Johnston calls for prompt action to collect as much information as possible while the opportunity for still exists. This in itself is not unusual: Many researchers of endangered communities feel the twin pressures of a dwindling pool of native users and the lack of sufficient resources to adequately capture the existing language. Additionally, this push to preserve signed languages is not a first for the signing Deaf community but a coda to a movement that began in the United States in 1913 with an effort by the National Association of the Deaf to preserve-through film-the language of signs for posterity (Schuchman 2005). What is unusual about Johnston's call to collect data on the use of Auslan for posterity is his recognition that the scientific framework that is generating the conditions that may lead to the demise of the Australian signing Deaf community is the same framework that can help preserve it. Johnston says, Refusing to take seriously the task of recording a corpus of Auslan for ongoing and future would display a profound indifference toward our cultural heritage, and a lack of appreciation of the most basic principles of scientific research (170 this volume). Indeed, his comments can be read as implying that the scientific community has a moral responsibility to preserve, as much as is possible, the corpus of Auslan. Johnston's observation that the principles of scientific call for the preservation of Auslan through documentation is more than a trope. The double-edged sword of scientific is readily apparent in its effects on signing Deaf communities. The values and aims of science are not prima facie contradictory, but in this case, conflict results. Here, the wish to improve the quality of peoples' lives through therapeutic means with technology poses a threat to the existence of communities that have developed under particular conditions. Yet, the desire to collect information from diverse human communities offers the promise of new information that may not be available elsewhere. These two aims are part and parcel of the Enlightenment ideal, but perhaps they bear closer scrutiny in the twenty-first century. Here are some questions worth asking: What steps ought to be taken when the introduction of technology has the potential to radically change the nature of a community? Do the dominant communities have ethical obligations to evaluate and ameliorate the impact of their scientific findings on nondominant communities? Should scientific and technological progress be withheld from communities under certain conditions? If so, what might the limits of these conditions be? It is especially important to address these questions now, as genetic technology is still in a nascent state. The dialogue on the effects of this technology should be part of the response to the situation in Australia concurrently with the data collection that Johnston so cogently argues for. I do not know whether this is the first instance of scientific progress directly threatening a linguistic community, but I suspect that it is unique. Unlike other endangered communities, which may disappear in part due to the indirect role that technological progress plays, the scientific and technological agenda here is to eliminate the necessary condition (deafness) for the continued existence of the signing Deaf community. This is not to say that scientists have set out to eradicate the signing Deaf community but to note that the aim of treating deafness through technology has the effect of reducing linguistic diversity overall. …",0,1
"Adopting a language ideological perspective, this article explores corporate sociolinguistic economies and the values given to languages and communicative competences within them. The focus is on how values are attributed to language choice and accommodation practices, and the impact of conditions of transience and change on these values. Using interview data from three Danish-owned multinationals, questions of language management, language exclusion and inclusion, accommodative competences, and instrumentality are explored. It is shown that issues of scale, global to local, as well as numbers, affect values within sociolinguistic economies as do tensions between communicative efficiency and fair access to knowledge. It is argued that conditions of flux favor the instrumental value of English, which is perceived as both a stable resource and a stabilizing force, but in local contexts, other languages, such as Danish, provide alternative and valued resources. Transience can be a disruptive factor, which becomes part of managerial decisions concerning linguistic exclusion and inclusion. Foreign languages, other than English, have situated value and tend to be linked to more long-term prospects or to more durable relations of varying frequencies of contact. Ud fra et sprogideologisk perspektiv undersøger denne artikel virksomheders sociolingvistiske økonomier og de værdier, medarbejderne knytter til sprog og kommunikative kompetencer. Der fokuseres på, hvordan sprogvalg og sproglig akkommodation tillægges værdier, samt hvordan forbigående og omskiftelige tilstande påvirker disse værdier. På basis af interviewdata fra tre danskejede multinationale virksomheder undersøges sprogmanagement, sproglig eksklusion og inklusion, kompetencer i sproglig akkommodation samt sprogenes instrumentalitet. Artiklen viser, at forhold som organisationsniveau, antallet af ikke-dansktalende medarbejdere samt spændinger mellem effektiv kommunikation og rimelig adgang til viden påvirker værdier i sociolingvistiske økonomier. Der argumenteres for, at forbigående og omskiftelige forhold øger den instrumentelle værdi af engelsk, der betragtes som en stabil og stabiliserende faktor, mens andre sprog, såsom dansk, anses for alternative og i lokale kontekster værdsatte ressourcer.

"The paper represents an attempt to explicitly summarize most of the major theoretical and methodological problems that, as of today, hinder significant progress in the field of macrocomparative linguistics (research on distant relationships between the various language families of the world). Among these problems are such issues as: the amount, quality, and nature of linguistic data that is necessary to establish long-distance relationship; methodological priorities of the etymologization process; and the complex interdependencies of “objective” (automated) and “subjective” (manual) data comparison. Partial solutions and/or recommendations of a general character are offered for each of the specified issues.",0,1
"In a well-known and much discussed article, the philosopher Bertrand Russell wrote as follows (Russell, 1952): If I were to suggest that between the Earth and Mars there is a china teapot revolving about the sun in an elliptical orbit, nobody would be able to disprove my assertion provided I were careful to add that the teapot is too small to be revealed even by our most powerful telescopes. Setting aside Russell's reasons for writing this sentence (in context, to do with both the burden of proof and the existence or otherwise of a deity) I would like to focus on what, in the above extract, is a single word: ‘teapot’. If you, as a reader and no doubt writer of the English language, were required to convey in writing the same concept (a ceramic or metal receptacle with a handle, spout and lid, in which tea is brewed and from which it is poured) would you go for ‘teapot’, ‘tea-pot’ or ‘tea pot’? In other words, to use a phrase commonly heard when the amount of sugar in a cup of tea is discussed, do you think teapot/tea pot should be one lump or two?",0,1
"Ecological-cognition approaches share the overall assumption that cognition is enacted, extended, embedded, and embodied. In this article, these basic assumptions are illustrated and critically evaluated from the point of view of gesture and film studies. In a theoretical introduction, the idea of metaphorizing as embodied interactivity is developed and connected with these basic assumptions of an ecological cognition approach to metaphor. Four case studies illustrate how metaphoricity in face-to-face contexts and in film viewing is enacted, extended, embedded, and embodied. Examples from gesturing face-to-face and a case study of a television news report serve to illustrate how metaphors in these ecologies have important common characteristics: they emerge from metaphorizing as embodied interactivity.",0,1
"Abstract It is amazing that I have written for more than a year on Emerging Trends without mentioning China’s investments in Artificial Intelligence (AI). Now that I have moved to Baidu, I would like to take this opportunity to share some of my personal observations with what’s happening in China over the past 25 years. The top universities in China have always been very good, but they are better today than they were 25 years ago, and they are on a trajectory to become the biggest and the best in the world. China is investing big time in what we do, both in the private sector and the public sector. Kai-Fu Lee is bullish on his investments in AI and China. There is a bold government plan for AI with specific milestones for parity with the West in 2020, major breakthroughs by 2025 and the envy of the world by 2030.",0,1
"Abstract The cognitive neuroscience of language relies largely on controlled experiments that are different from the everyday situations in which we use language. This review describes an approach that studies specific aspects of sentence comprehension in the brain using data collected while participants perform an everyday task, such as listening to a story. The approach uses ‘neuro‐computational’ models that are based on linguistic and psycholinguistic theories. These models quantify how a specific computation, such as identifying a syntactic constituent, might be carried out by a neural circuit word‐by‐word. Model predictions are tested for their statistical fit with measured brain data. The paper discusses three applications of this approach: (i) to probe the location and timing of linguistic processing in the brain without requiring unnatural tasks and stimuli, (ii) to test theoretical hypotheses by comparing the fits of different models to naturalistic data, and (iii) to study neural mechanisms for language processing in populations that are poorly served by traditional methods.",0,1
"ABSTRACT Etymology and the winds of change. There's a lot of weather about these days, isn't there? Until relatively recently the weather was just what we saw when we drew back the curtains and looked out of the bedroom window in the morning, but now things have changed dramatically. These days every time we turn on the TV or open a newspaper it is quite ‘usual’ for some part of the world to be experiencing ‘unusual’ weather. The Arctic is not yet a tropical paradise but it is starting to move in that direction and England, parts of which a mere year or so ago were drying up like so many dead leaves, has in recent months seen some of the worst floods in its history. And who among us had heard of the word tsunami (Japanese for ‘harbour wave’) before the terrible events of December 2004 in Thailand and Indonesia?",0,1

"1. The need for a communication policy, language policy, or language planning Ever since God saw fit to inflict punishment on those who built the tower of Babel, there has been a need for an interlingual language policy entailing language selection in order to achieve successful communication.

In the beginning, God took responsibility for the naming:",0,1
"The research objective has been to address the situation of the trade-union movement, using ELA’s trajectory study as a reference. This path has been contrasted with other practices related both to State-Nations —Western Europe— and Nations without state —Quebec—. The dissertation aims to reveal a double transition experienced by ELA; the first related to the shift from an institutional to a counter-power unionism, the second, linked to nation-related issues and the convergence from a statutory model to a sovereignity. For this purpose, it is compulsory to analyze ELA’s trajectory taking into account the impacts of this transition from that time to the present. The resulting model must be identified as Combative trade-unionism. This term refers to Quebecan unionism due to the importance of protest action in their collective intervention. In the specific case we are studying, the systematic presence of the union struggle should be emphasized. Such fight has displaced and replaced the previous institutional practice as a tool to defend workers’ rights and claims.",0,1
"Until now, academic interest in intercultural communication has largely ignored the fact that much if not most of these interactions go on in second and foreign language varieties (cf. Kachru 1994: 13), and, specifically, the role of English as a lingua franca (House 1999: 74). Another shortcoming of studies of intercultural communication is an undue theoretical restriction in functionalist pragmatic approaches that excludes crucial aspects of the category “culture,” on the grounds that they lie outside of the scope of linguistic pragmatics (e.g., Blommaert 1991). In opposition to this tenet, the study of the relation between language and culture has been on the agenda of cognitive linguistics from the very beginning, and recent works in this field highlight the usage-based nature of the cognitive linguistic enterprise, which in turn shifts the focus to questions of sociolinguistic and socio-cultural variation (Dirven 2005; Geeraerts 2005). To our minds, cognitive linguistics, and cognitive sociolinguistics (Kristiansen & Dirven forthcoming) in particular, have much to contribute to overcome the limitations of functionalist pragmatics. So the aim and scope of our paper are as follows: First, we will discuss the implications of the use of English in intercultural communication against the backdrop of current debates in the field of world Englishes. Following this short discussion, we will present the results of studies involving second language (L2) speakers from different cultural backgrounds that highlight differences in conceptualizations pertaining to the domain(s) of family, age, and ancestors. We will argue that these differences are likely to result in intercultural incomprehension or misunderstanding (in a wide sense). Abstracting from this cognitive-pragmatic level, we will use our examples to highlight shortcomings of mere functionalism, and to demonstrate that cognitive linguistics, with its semantic and conceptual orientation, can enhance our understanding of the different cultures of speakers engaged in intercultural communication. Finally, at the metatheoretical level, we will point out that the application of cognitive linguistic methods to the study of intercultural communication entails a further recognition of hermeneutics in cognitive linguistics (cf. Geeraerts 1992).",0,1
"AbstractParents do not choose first names for their children at random. Using two large datasets, for the UK and the Netherlands, covering the names of children born in the same family over a period of two decades, this paper seeks to identify clusters of names entirely inferred from common parental naming preferences. These name groups can be considered as coherent sets of names that have a high probability to be found in the same family. Operational measures for the statistical association between names and clusters are developed, as well as a two-stage clustering technique. The name groups are subsequently merged into a limited set of grand clusters. The results show that clusters emerge with cultural, linguistic, or ethnic parental backgrounds, but also along characteristics inherent in names, such as clusters of names after flowers and gems for girls, abbreviated names for boys, or names ending in –y or -ie.",0,1

"In this paper, we present preliminary results on how an individual’s writing style persists even across languages. In other words, what aspects of an individual’s writing will persist irrespective of the language in which he or she writes? We argue that cognitive and social traits are likely to persist and demonstrate this by two separate analyses of bilingual corpora using the same individuals. We show that for various measures of linguistic complexity (which we consider to be a cognitive variable) and participation in specific social conventions (a social one), the correlation between scores on the two languages studied is significantly higher than would be expected by chance. We argue that this type of correlation may permit cross-linguistic authorship attribution.",0,1

"Abstract More than 12,000 migrant engineers have migrated to Australia in the past four years – the majority NESB professionals of prime workforce age selected under the skilled immigration program. These engineers are currently experiencing extreme levels of unemployment – in part due to Australia’s recession, but in part due to disproportionate labour market rejection. This paper examines the critical ‘gatekeeping’ role of the employment interview. It explores the cultural attitudes a range of East European engineers bring to Australian engineering job interview questions – in particular ‘process’ questions (requiring detailed description of knowledge of engineering processes), and ‘self-promotion’ questions (inviting positive presentation of demonstrated professional skills). The paper then analyses the videotaped job interview performance of two East European engineers, who answer such questions poorly in interviews conducted by the Institution of Engineers, Australia. The paper suggests that disparities between country of origin interview strategies and those used in Australia might usefully be targeted as areas for further research. Such research could lead to more effective cross-cultural interview training, while lessening the risk of interview failure.",0,1

"Rather than simply being abridged versions of general dictionaries, many nineteenth-century children's dictionaries were stylistically and ideologically adapted for child readers with the aim of providing social and moral education. This paper explores one facet of ideological adaptation of monolingual English children's dictionaries in nineteenth-century England, namely religious education. Before elementary education was made compulsory and secular with the 1870 Education Act, all education was fundamentally religious. However, there was disagreement about the nature of this edification. Views on childhood in this period varied, but educationalists agreed that a person's early years were the most formative. Wordings of definitions and choices of entry-words within nineteenth-century children's dictionaries were not simply guided by limitations of space or ideas about children's intellectual capabilities, but also by lexicographers' moral and religious views and their ideas about how children should be educated. This paper considers the pervasiveness of religion in children's dictionaries in terms of establishing a Protestant Christian norm against which other beliefs were judged and in terms of inculcating children with the precepts of the ""true"" religion. Focusing on the treatment of Roman Catholicism, the article examines religious bias and moral-religious prescriptivism in definitions and illustrative examples.",0,1

"Research has shown that native speakers (NSs) are generally capable of adjusting their language to make it appropriate for a non-native speaker (NNS) interlocutor's proficiency. Very little is known in general about humorous interaction in intercultural communication, and in particular little is known about whether, how, and what types of conversational adjustments are made during such interaction. The research presented here suggests that the adjustments made by NSs during conversational humor often may not be appropriate for the NNS. In fact, in this type of communication, NSs who do not have experience in intercultural communication may actually overestimate the amount and types of adjustments that are necessary, thus underestimating the second language (L2) user's proficiency. The result is that the L2 user sometimes gets marginalized and constructed as less than competent during playful interaction. This paper reports on a case study of one L2 user who, due to the interactional adjustments that were made when humor was used, was often positioned in marginalizing ways by interlocutors who were inexperienced in intercultural communication.",0,1

"In the evolutionary context of Industry 4.0, where machine learning and machine to machine technology are powerful tools for the maintenance and replicability of knowledge, the implementation of hybrid systems based on the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) represents the key to organizational innovation and to the capitalization of knowledge. At the same time, the benefits of digital transformation for individuals and teams are often not so clear - and uncertainty surrounding the future often results in fear in those being impacted. Fear of changes to their job, fear of a job role change, job losses, being faced with learning new skills, new technology or new ways of working. Therefore, to secure the transition to the digitization organizations need to carefully support their human resources and to provide them with the reasons why they need to commit to change. In this perspective, the study aimed to investigate how high-qualified knowledge workers cope with this new situation. Yet, participants were a group of project managers, employed in some knowledge-based organizations, in which AI and digitalization systems are going to be introduced to improve replicability, circulation and storage of knowledge. The choice of this peculiar target of participants was guided by the acknowledgement of their important role within the organization, being project managers generally considered as agents of change. In view of the above, the main goal was to collect project managers’ expectations and fears about the upcoming integration of secularized company flows with performing process automation strategies. In-depth individual interviews were conducted and diatextual analysis was used to approach the discursive data collected. Results showed interesting insights both in terms of organizational management implications as well as of future research development. Participants showed clear awareness about the need to “go digital” to improve organizational performance and to stay competitive. However, they underlined the importance of parallel invest on human capital, improving crucial soft skills such as: openness to change, flexibility and the ability to work in a team, that could concretely support digital changes in procedures and work processes.",0,1
"An emergent discourse in contemporary Catalonia has linked economic liberalism and the project to constitute an independent state. By examining the journalistic texts of economist Xavier Sala i Martin and executive Xavier Roig, I show how this discourse reacts against two main and closely related phenomena: first, the fact that the restoration of the Generalitat after Francoism has entailed the statalization of Catalan civil society; and, second, the vanishing of the «entrepreneurial Catalan» as a central figure of the collective imaginary. My paper argues that the statalization of civil society and the devalorization of work are not conjunctural phenomena specific to Catalonia but structural tendencies of finance capitalism. To illustrate this point, I analyze Jordi Galceran's play El metode Gronholm, in which the main character, Ferran Auge, is the perfect expression of the contradiction between the «entrepreneurial Catalan» and multinational capitalism. I further argue that liberalism cannot contest these structural tendencies; on the contrary, these are the consequence of the fusion of the state and the market that is essential to neoliberal capitalism. In this respect, the separatism of this liberal discourse emerges as the desire that Catalonia can fully participate in the interstate competition for global capital.",0,1
"The phonological structure of the tone unit in terms of only one tonic element per tone unit is discussed in (1.1) and related to Brazil's theory of proclaiming and referring tones. It is argued that certain claims of Brazil's theory are too strong (1.2). When describing discourse functions it is necessary to recognize besides the ‘given’/‘new’ dichotomy, a distinction between ‘foregroundworthy’ and ‘less foregroundworthy’ elements (2.1). This leads me to formulate two kinds of information presentation: rising and falling communication (2.2). It is also argued that there is a need for a distinction between a semantically and a formally defined theme. This makes it possible to incorporate the Prague notions of objective and subjective order of theme and rheme into the theory (2.3). Finally, it is shown that the concept of rising and falling communication can be used to differentiate different reading and text styles (2.4).",0,1

"Abstract Any has a more restricted distribution than other determiners. While it is uncontroversial that providing an adequate description of this distribution requires recourse to semantics, a full description has remained elusive. This holds, in particular, due to the intricate behavior of any in modal and non‐monotone environments, where sensitivity to extra‐grammatical factors is sometimes attested. Drawing on the insights of Kadmon and Landman, and on independently motivated mechanisms in grammar, we show that such descriptive challenges can be answered without abandoning a uniform treatment of any across the different environments. The resulting picture falls naturally out of an approach that takes any to be accompanied by covert even . There are two parts to this review. Part I attends to the distribution of any in entailment‐reversing and modal environments. Part II turns to an explanation of this distribution, its predictions about the distribution of any in non‐monotone environments, and to differences between any and some allied expressions. The review concludes by pointing out several open questions left for future research.",0,1
"I review the classic literature in generative grammar and Marr’s three-level program for cognitive science to defend the Evaluation Metric as a psychological theory of language learning. Focusing on well-established facts of language variation, change, and use, I argue that optimal statistical principles embodied in Bayesian inference models are ill-suited for language acquisition. Specific attention will be given to the Subset Problem: Indirect negative evidence, which can be attractively formulated in the Bayesian framework, is ineffective when the statistical properties of language are examined in detail. As an alternative, I suggest that the Tolerance Principle (Yang 2016) provides a unified solution for the problem of induction and generalization: It bridges the computational and algorithm levels in Marr’s formulation, while retaining the commitment to the formal and empirical constraints in child language development.",0,1

As an illustrative example it uses the age-dependent eligibility of women in the Netherlands to receive routine breast cancer screening examinations: according to Dutch regulations women under 50 are ineligible for them. The present qualitative study rests on and complements three experimental studies on the persuasiveness of mammography information leaflets; it uses interviews to elucidate reasons why the arguments in the health communication leaflets for the exclusion of women under 50 from routine mammographic screenings do not work.,0,1
"The aim of the paper is to present the results of a research project called ‘Tell Me’, conducted from October 2018 to March 2020. The project focused on Bengali children living in Venice, Italy, and aimed to describe (1) children’s languages in the home environment and at school; (2) the quality and quantity of input they receive in every language (both at school and at home); and (3) how the family language policy and the Italian language institution policy at schools may influence and impact their language development. The project studied seven children with migration background between the ages of four and six. All these children are suspected of having a communication disorder or a language acquisition disability, since they do not speak Italian fluently as a second language at school or Bengali as their first language at home. According to neuropsychiatrists’ hypothesis, results will show that children are just not exposed sufficiently to quality L1, L2, or L3 input (at home and in different social contexts) and that in many cases these children are learning English as their main language, as it is considered as a status symbol, as well as a resource able to improve their lives.",0,1

"Reviewed by: Teaching and Learning Vocabulary: Bringing Research to Practice Linda Borer Hiebert, E.H., & Kamil, M.L. (Eds.) (2005). Teaching and Learning Vocabulary: Bringing Research to Practice. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum. Pp. 273, $39.95 US. Wilkins (1972, p. 111) declared that 'while without grammar very little can be conveyed, without vocabulary nothing can be conveyed,' and therein lies the value of the book I am reviewing. Teaching and Learning Vocabulary features presentations from a conference on vocabulary held in Dallas, TX, in October 2003. With a balanced focus on theory and practice, its 12 chapters address important issues in vocabulary learning for children, young adolescents, and second language learners. It is divided into three sections: how vocabulary is learned, instructional interventions to enhance vocabulary, and ways to choose words for instruction. The editors begin the first section with recommendations proposed by the National Reading Panel in 2000. These include multiple exposures to new words; rich and varied contexts, including computer-assisted ones; direct and incidental teaching; and active engagement of learners, particularly low-SES learners and those whose English-language proficiency is low. Nagy continues with a chapter delineating causal links between reading comprehension and factors such as vocabulary size, background knowledge, verbal aptitude, and ease of access to printed material. He discusses implications for long-term instruction to improve reading, enrich connections between instructed words and prior knowledge, and facilitate contextual inferencing and metalinguistic analysis of unknown words. In chapter 3, in a comparison of oral and written language, Cunningham discusses how being read to promotes receptive recognition and how independent geared-to-ability reading helps learners derive word meanings via repeated exposures in different contexts. Completing this section is an article in which Scott presents implications regarding within-word factors (morphological [End Page 469] structure, part of speech, concreteness of meaning), text variables (conceptual difficulty, helpfulness of context, density of other unknown words, repetition of key words), and sociocultural aspects (vocabulary size, world knowledge, and reading purpose of the reader) that influence the acquisition of new words. In the section on vocabulary instruction, Stahl provides suggestions for preventing gaps in levels of word knowledge among children. He recommends providing definitional and contextual information, tying new words to known words, and explicitly teaching salient words before or during reading. He suggests showing learners how a word relates to other words, how it changes in different contexts, and how it is used in production. The next chapter presents a study by Calderon, August, Slavin, Duran, Madden, and Cheung involving low-SES Grade 2 students making a transition from L1 Spanish to L2 English instruction. In the experimental classrooms, teachers pronounced new English words and provided a definition and a sample sentence; learners repeated the word and engaged in oral and written activities for practice and review. Compared to control classes using a regular basal reader program, the experimental groups outperformed the control group, and their L1 reading skills improved as well. Chapter 7 discusses a successful vocabulary improvement project presented to fourth- and fifth-grade ESL learners, and chapter 8 describes a program called PAVEd for Success that was designed to improve the vocabularies of pre-kindergarten children. In the final chapter in this section, Baumann, Font, Edwards, and Boland report on how fifth-grade students trained to use prefixes and contextual clues showed a greater increase in vocabulary than those in a control group who read and responded to a children's book. The third section of the book answers the question, How do I choose which words to teach? Beck, McKeown, and Kucan posit that Tier 1 words (known words with concrete meanings) and Tier 3 words (infrequently occurring words best learned in specific content areas) are not as suitable for classroom instruction. They suggest emphasizing Tier 2 words, which are frequent, useful in different contexts, easily connected to other words and concepts, and facilitative of conceptual understanding of the topic under study. Biemiller, reporting on empirical evidence that children learn specific word meanings in a roughly fixed order depending on their vocabulary size, not their grade level, suggests that primary-grade teachers introduce words that are known by about 30% of students in Grade 2...",0,1
"Branan and Erlewine (2022) argue for the existence of an Ā-probe that can only be satisfied if its goal is the closest DP. The motivation for such a probe comes from a series of relativization strategies in several languages that appear to only target the highest DP in the clause. In this reply, I argue that their data only motivate the existence of probes that attract the closest DP—their data fail canonical diagnostics for Ā-movement, suggesting that we should eliminate Ā from the description. This being the case, I suggest that the descriptive label relative clause applies to both A- and Ā-constructions, where independent diagnostics are needed to distinguish each case.",0,1
"Abstract This article explores the syntax of radically truncated clauses in colloquial Hungarian. I argue that radically truncated clauses arise when, in informal speech situations and under time pressure, the derivation is terminated prematurely, at the VP level, and the bare VP (lacking any of the higher functional projections) is sent to spellout (PF) and semantic interpretation (LF). Due to their radically truncated nature, such clauses provide us a unique window through which it becomes possible to explore the fine structure of the minimal VP in itself. I show that radically‐truncated‐clause data are highly relevant to various theoretical questions, such as the head–complement branching order, the adjunction analysis of topicalization and quantification, and the split‐DP proposal. I argue that observations about radically truncated clauses support the availability of OV as a nonderived, basic word order, that they are in line with the adjunction analysis of topicalization and quantifier raising, and that they corroborate the split‐DP analysis of arguments. The discussion is supported with evidence from corpus data and with rigorous statistical analysis of grammaticality‐judgment‐survey results.",0,1
"There is a school of thought which links connectionist models of cognition to eliminativism‐the thesis that the constructs of commonsense psychology (principally, beliefs and desires) do not exist. This way of construing the impact of connectionist modelling is, I argue, deeply mistaken and depends crucially on a shallow analysis of the notion of explanation. I argue that good, higher level descriptions may group together physically heterogenous mechanisms, and that the constructs of folk psychology may fulfil such a grouping function even if they fail to pick out discrete states of individual processing. More speculatively, the paper goes on to suggest that the virtues which recommend such constructs from a theorist's third person perspective may nonetheless have close analogues in individual processing. Various difficulties for what I term a pure distributed connectionism may be solved by systems which utilise both distributed and classical symbolic representations‐the latter exhibiting the discreteness and semantic interpretability which the eliminativist (wrongly) requires to vindicate common‐sense psychology. If human beings turned out to be such mixed systems, then the eliminativist claim would be doubly misguided. It would be false as a conditional since even if pure distributed connectionism were a complete and accurate formal model of individual processing, it would not follow that the other, higher level constructs were not accurate and essential tools for a different kind of explanation. And it would involve a false antecedent since in a mixed system the symbolic descriptions may indeed be incarnate in the system's own individual processing. The paper is in four main sections. Section 1 attempts to systematise a certain received picture of the relative status and accuracy of various levels of description of a (pure distributed) connectionist system. Section 2 then introduces a general model of explanations which aim to group systems into equivalence classes defined for various purposes. Each grouping requires a special vocabulary and the constructs of any given vocabulary are legitimate just insofar as the grouping is interesting and useful. Section 3 goes on to show that, relative to such a model of explanation, the constructs of both symbolic AI and commonsense psychology may have a legitimate role to play in giving psychological explanations. This role is not just that of a useful approximation. The paper ends with a speculative section in which the argument for the theoretical usefulness of such symbolic constructs is extended, in a very natural way, to the domain of individual processing. Here the cognizer, in the process of regulating, debugging and understanding her own representations, creates symbols to stand for sets of distributed activity patterns. The section points out some difficulties for a pure distributed approach which may be eased by the addition of such symbolic constructs and relates the speculations to the current debate over the ‘correct’architecture of cognition. If the speculations are on target, this whole debate turns out to be fundamentally illposed.",0,1
"Danger and Usefulness affect word recognition (e.g., Wurm &amp; Vakoch, 2000), and a related construct affects memory (e.g., Nairne, Thompson, &amp; Pandeirada, 2007). We tested hypotheses about differential effects of these dimensions, based on the relevance of concepts relative to the time perceptual systems underwent selection pressures. In two experiments participants made auditory and visual lexical decisions for nouns rated on Danger, Usefulness, and “Ancientness.” Danger interacted with Ancientness in both auditory and visual processing. Increasing Danger led to faster RTs and better accuracy only for words judged to have ancient relevance. Interactions with participant gender were seen in both auditory and visual analyses. Consistent with Wurm, Whitman, Seaman, Hill, and Ulstad (2007), men’s but not women’s auditory performance improved with increasing Danger. The beneficial effect of Usefulness on accuracy was greater for women than for men in both experiments. Danger and Usefulness effects seem to reflect a general principle underlying human cognition.",0,1
"In Chapter 12 of the thirteenth-century Oxford logician William of Sherwood's Treatise on Syncategorematic Words (Syncategoremata), Sherwood discusses the word only (tantum), which in the example Only Socrates is running indicates, according to Sherwood, ‘how much of the subject is under the predicate—viz. that the subject Socrates and no more is under it. In that case it is an exclusive word’ (Sherwood 1968: 8I). In Chapter 7 of the twentieth-century English logician Peter Geach's (1962/1980) Reference and Generality, Geach discusses the words only and alone, remarking that medieval logicians ‘were greatly interested in exclusive propositions, but their treatment of them was on the whole superficial. This comes out in their having generally accepted the idea that exclusive propositions were exponible as conjunctions “Socrates alone is wise”, say, as “Socrates is wise and nobody besides (other than) Socrates is wise”… If the force of the exclusive proposition is to exclude everything other than what is named in or by the subject–term from “sharing in the predicate”, that is no reason for reading in an implication that something named by the subject–term does “share in the predicate”’ (Geach 1962/ 208–9). This dispute between English logicians across seven centuries has been echoed in recent and influential work by the Anglo-American philosopher H. Paul Grice and by linguists, notably Laurence Horn in his (1969) ‘A Presuppositional Analysis of ONLY and EVEN’, in his (1989) treatise A Natural History of Negation, Lauri Karttunen and Stanley Peters in their (1979) ‘Conventional Implicature’, and Josef Taglicht in his (1984) book Message and Emphasis: On Focus and Scope in English. In this paper I shall argue that neither Sherwood, with his conjunction analysis of Only x is F, nor Geach, with his non–conjunctive analysis, nor Horn, with his presuppositional analysis, nor Taglicht, with his conjunction analysis of only and his conventional implicature analysis of also and even, have accounted for the semantic and pragmatic facts, for their analyses have failed to integrate linguistic facts about topic and focus, about entailments, and about Gricean (1975, 1989) ‘implicatures’. By reconsidering their views I hope to show how a more coherent account can be achieved. In the course of this paper I will offer my own analysis, building on what I have learned from theirs and, I hope, improving on them.",0,1

"1. The objections of Kuhn and Quirk to various reinterpretations of Old English digraph spellings, including our own, have made it clear that extensive discussion of single structure points in the overall frame of the Old English phonological system is a wasteful procedure.' The system and the minimal oppositions which make up the system are coexistent and difficult to discuss intelligibly without going through the circular but internally consistent process of describing the one in terms of the other. Taking our departure from a pattern whose outlines were implicit but largely unstated, we attempted to deal with one point of the structure in detail. This kind of presentation seems to have been a mistake, and to have led to some of Kuhn and Quirk's misunderstanding of OP 4. The correction of our error of judgment about presentation must, however, await further research and publication, undertaken not to prove a thesis but to arrive at the most complete, consistent, and economical interpretation of the total evidence.2 The present article, therefore, only points out some matters of fact and clarifies the basic disagreements. 2. Retractions and emendations are given below in three groups, followed by minor matters requiring brief clarification. 2.1. The first group emends errors and inconsistencies in OP 4 pointed out by Kuhn and Quirk. For these points (149, 144, 152, 146) we are pleased to acknowledge our debt to them. 2.11.

"What do terms such as the committee, the league, and the group of women denote? Pre-theoretically, group terms have a dual personality. On the one hand, the committee corresponds to an entity as ideosyncratic in its properties as any other object; for instance, two otherwise identical committees can vary with respect to the purpose for which they were formed. Call this aspect the group-as-individual. On the other hand, the identity of a group is at least partially determined by the properties of its members; for instance, a committee will be a committee of women just in case each of its members is a woman. Call this aspect the group-as-set. Elaborating on suggestions in Link (1984) and Lasersohn (1988), I propose that group terms in English denote atomic individuals, that is, entities lacking internal structure. In particular, it is not possible to determine the membership of a group by examining the denotation of a group term. The proposed account correctly predicts that group terms systematically behave differently semantically (as well as syntactically) from plurals such as the men and conjunctions such as John and Bill. Thus the atomic analysis advocated here stands in sharp contrast to previous proposals, including Bennet (1975), Link (1984), and Landman (1989), in which group terms are considered of a piece semantically with plurals and conjunctions. Additional arguments come from the use of names of groups as rigid designators, from the parallel between group nouns and measure nouns, and from the distribution of group terms across two dialects of English.",0,1
"Multichannel teleconferencing systems exploit multichannel acoustic echo cancellers to weaken the echo replicas due to the acoustic coupling among loudspeakers and microphones. Many issues have to be dealt with to ensure an effective echo cancellation in such systems, including the reduction of the interchannel coherence among channels, the detection of an active remote human speaker, and the identification of the well-known double-talk scenario. In this paper, a comprehensive solution for dealing with the aforementioned aspects is discussed. The core of this solution is the estimation of the fundamental frequency of the audio signal. It is exploited for weakening the linear relation among channels and for tracking the presence of an active human speaker both in the remote room and in the local room of a teleconferencing system. The computational complexity of the presented approach is also reported to support its feasibility in a real scenario. Then, its real-time implementation is presented and validated on the NU-Tech framework, showing its fundamental frequency tracking capability and echo reduction performance both in simulated and real scenarios.",0,1
"We show that hitherto unstudied constructions of long split focalization (LSF) in Hungarian provide evidence for a double derivation analysis, in that they can involve either a movement derivation or a base-generation one. These derivations correlate with different patterns of verbal definiteness agreement and case marking. The evidence for the double derivation analysis comes from two sources. First, there is systematic speaker variation in the acceptance of movement derivations: whereas all speakers accept base-generation sentences, only a subgroup of them accepts movement sentences. Second, island phenomena support the analysis: we find that base-generation sentences show no sensitivity to islands, whereas movement ones do.",0,1

"This article presents acoustic evidence for the existence of a bilabial implosive, [ƃ], in one variety of U.S. English. One articulatory observation is that vocal chord vibration of the English bilabial stop, /b/, can only be maintained for a maximum of about 82 ms. Increasing the vibration beyond this threshold is only possible by increasing the size of the vocal cavity, which in turn is often enabled by lowering the glottis, a gesture characteristic of implosive stops. The authors compare the voiced bilabial stops of five white males from the Western united States, three of whom impressionistically appear to have implosive stops and two who do not. For each stop, a normalized stop duration was calculated based on speech tempo, the actual stop duration, and the percentage of the stop that displayed vocal fold vibration. As far as normalized stop duration is concerned, there are no significant differences between the five speakers. However, the vocal fold vibration patterns for the two nonimplosive-sounding speakers and the three implosive-sounding speakers differ a great deal. In addition to evidence for biliabial implosives, there are large differences in the percentage of stop closure that displays vocal fold vibration. Both of these factors merit further study in terms of their social distribution in English, which is not known for implosion.",0,1
"Building on the success of the VU Amsterdam Metaphor Corpus, which comprises English texts annotated with metaphor following the Metaphor Identification Procedure Vrjie Universiteit (MIPVU; Steen et al. in Cogn Linguist 21(4):765–796, 2010a; Steen et al. in A method for linguistic metaphor identification: from MIP to MIPVU. John Benjamins, Amsterdam/Philadelphia, 2010b), this study has three aims: (1) to adapt and evaluate the transferability and reliability of MIPVU for Mandarin Chinese; (2) to construct a corpus of Chinese texts annotated for metaphor using the adapted procedure; and (3) to examine the distribution of metaphor-related words across Chinese texts in three different written registers: academic discourse, fiction, and news. The results of our inter-annotator reliability test show that MIPVU can be reliably applied to linguistic metaphor identification in Chinese texts. Our metaphor-annotated corpus consists of texts randomly sampled from the Lancaster Corpus of Mandarin Chinese, totaling 30,012 words (about 10,000 for each register). Data analysis reveals that approximately one out of every nine lexical units in our Chinese corpus is related to metaphor, that there is considerable variation in metaphor density across different registers and lexical categories, and that metaphor density is significantly lower in Chinese than in English texts. Our assessment of the replicability of MIPVU for Mandarin Chinese adds to the groundbreaking methodological contribution that Steen et al. (2010a, b) has made to metaphor research. The metaphor-annotated corpus of Mandarin Chinese contributes a valuable language resource for Chinese metaphor researchers, and our analysis of the distribution of metaphor-related words in the corpus offers useful new insights into the extent and use of metaphor in Chinese discourse.",0,1
"Phonological processes are often sensitive to morphological, prosodic, and derivational structure. In terms of derivational structure, a common factor are strata or levels, as in Lexical Phonology (Kiparsky 1982) or Stratal OT (Bermúdez-Otero 2018). Two commonly argued strata are the stem-level and word-level cophonologies which are morphologically triggered. In this paper, I argue that Armenian has cyclic processes which follow this stratal model. However, I also show that Armenian phonology utilizes a prosodically-triggered cophonology. This cophonology is triggered by the prosodic misalignment between the morphological stem (MStem) and syllable boundaries. This occurs before vowel-initial inflection. I argue that this misaligned MStem is parsed into a sublexical prosodic constituent, the Prosodic Stem (PStem: Downing 1999a). This PStem-level cophonology applies between the stem-level and word-level cophonologies.",0,1
"Human voice production for speech is an inefficient process in terms of energy expended to produce acoustic output. A traditional measure of vocal efficiency relates acoustic power radiated from the mouth to aerodynamic power produced in the trachea. This efficiency ranges between 0.001 % and 1.0 % in speech-like vocalization. Simplified Navier-Stokes equations for non-steady compressible airflow from trachea to lips were used to calculate steady aerodynamic power, acoustic power, and combined total power at seven strategic locations along the airway. A portion of the airway was allowed to collapse to produce self-sustained oscillation for sound production. A conversion efficiency, defined as acoustic power generated in the glottis to aerodynamic power dissipated, was found to be on the order of 10%, but wall vibration, air viscosity, and kinetic pressure losses consumed almost all of that power. This sound, reflected back and forth in the airway, was dissipated at a level on the order of 99.9 %.",0,1
"EJ: How did you become interested in linguistic studies? WL: I used to be a chemist and I worked in industry. I was attracted by an area where you could begin to develop something close to scientific principles in relation to language. My own view is that linguistics is not a science but that we're getting closer to it. Very few social sciences have solved the relationship between theory and practice. Most people feel that this is a one-way process. A group of theorists think up an idea and then someone else tries to put it into practice. In education, this can lead to theories that never work because the language they are based on is so far from the reality of the language that people actually use. An approach to linguistics is gaining momentum that takes a different approach, which begins with the language of everyday life, the language that children bring into the class-",0,1

"Very recently, the former spokesman of China's Ministry of Education launched a public attack on the national fervor for English learning in his personal blog ( Xinhua News , 2013). He forcefully argued that too much time and energy has been spent on learning English as a foreign language, which has seriously jeopardized Chinese citizens’ first-language education, and called for the cancellation of English lessons in the primary school curriculum. Following this, the Beijing municipal commission of education announced its plan to reduce the English section of the National University Entrance Qualifying Exam (or gaokao ) from 150 points to 100 points in major cities by 2016 so as to downplay the importance of English in the education system. A further report states that education authorities are also considering scrapping mandatory English lessons before the third grade. Shandong and Jiangsu provinces, as well as Shanghai, may remove English from the gaokao entirely ( The Guardian , 2013).",0,1
"Abstract In this study we argue that narrative storytelling and expository discussion, as 2 distinct discourse genres, differ both in linguistic expression and in their underlying principles of organization—schema-based in narratives and category-based in exposition. Innovative analyses applied to 160 personal-experience narratives and expository essays written by schoolchildren, adolescents, and adults on the shared topic of interpersonal conflict point to certain apparently contradictory facts about developing discourse abilities in the 2 genres. For example, genre differentiation is established early on (even the youngest children distinguish between the 2 types of discourse), but with age, participants tend to diverge from genre-typical content (by including expository-type generalizations in narratives and narrative-like incidents in expository texts). Also, across age groups, in local linguistic expression, participants use more advanced vocabulary and grammar in expository than in narrative texts, but in global-level discourse organization, they achieve command of expository text construction only in adolescence, whereas the principles governing narratives are established by middle childhood. We suggest that this apparent paradox can be accounted for by several interlocking factors: cognitive and linguistic development, increased experience with different varieties of discourse, and the communicative context in which a piece of discourse is produced. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This article derives from the keynote address given by Ruth A. Berman to the Society for Text and Discourse, Chicago, August 2004, titled Developing Narrative and Expository Text Construction: Same and/or Different? We are indebted to participants of the meeting for their comments and to the journal editor and three anonymous reviewers for their helpful feedback. The project was supported by a Spencer Foundation major grant for the study of “Developing Literacy in Different Contexts and in Different Languages,” Ruth Berman, principal investigator. English data collection was directed by Dr. Judy S. Reilly, San Diego State University, California. Notes 1Spelling and punctuation are standardized in these and all other examples. Participant ID is indicated by level of schooling (G, J, H, A), participant number (01 to 20), participant sex (m, f), and genre (narr, exp). 2Statistically significant distinctions between linguistic usage in narrative versus expository texts were documented for use of passive voice in Dutch, English, French, Hebrew, and Spanish (CitationJisa, Reilly, Verhoeven, Baruch, & Rosado, 2002); verb structure in Dutch, English, French, Hebrew, Icelandic, and Spanish (CitationRagnarsdóttir, Cahana-Amitay, van Hell, Rosado, & Viguié, 2002); temporal expression in English, Hebrew, and Spanish (CitationKupersmitt, 2006); subject–noun phrases in Dutch, English, Hebrew, and Spanish (CitationRavid, van Hell, Rosado, & Zamora, 2002); and use of modals in English, French, and Hebrew (CitationReilly, Jisa, Baruch, & Berman, 2002). Single-language studies have also found significant differences for agent downgrading in Spanish (CitationTolchinsky & Rosado, 2005); subjectless constructions, tense, mood, and verb types in Hebrew (CitationBerman & Nir-Sagiv, 2004); and pronouns, modals, and passives in English (CitationReilly, Zamora, & McGivern, 2005). 3After extensive piloting, it was decided to show the video film only once at the beginning of the first of two sessions separated by a few days in the case of schoolchildren and at the beginning of the single session for adults. 4In fact, in several countries outside of Israel, where the video was recorded, students asked what school in their hometown had been filmed for this purpose! 5The wording of instructions was adjusted in each language to ensure that all participants were familiar with the terms. For example, class talk was preferred to lecture and composition rather than essay was used in California, as compared to their equivalents in Romance languages such as French and Spanish. 6The “Latinate–Germanic divide” between learned, institutional, and more popular, everyday vocabulary emerged in early medieval times (CitationBarber, 2000; CitationPyles, 1971) and to this day, the Latinate vocabulary of English remains identified with rarer words, higher register, and more formal usage (CitationBauer, 1983; CitationHughes, 2000). 7Analyses conducted in a separate study revealed that these measures of vocabulary correlate in statistically significant ways (Berman et al., in press). 8Specifically, as reported by us in various talks and working papers, the Hebrew sample reveals highly similar developmental and cross-genre trends for mean clause length and use of relative clauses. 9As summed up in CitationNicolopolou (1997), narrative research includes structuralist story grammar as a rule-bound means for deriving discourse constituents (CitationMandler, 1987; CitationStein & Glenn, 1979; Citationvan den Broek et al., 1996), concern with the “evaluative” content of narratives (CitationLabov, 1972, Citation1997; CitationReilly, 1992; CitationReinhart, 1984), and the “form–function” approach linking linguistic forms to discourse functions such as reference, temporality, and event structuring (CitationBerman & Slobin, 1994; CitationHickmann, 2003). 10This means that, again, we use the term categories rather differently than in certain other discussions of expository discourse (e.g., CitationBlack, 1985; CitationSinger & O'Connell, 2003). 11The term schema has also been used to refer to nonnarrative discourse but without explicit definition of the notion or how a mental schema relates to discourse genre. We take the term to mean the mental representation of story structure components that are linked within a conventional narrative “action structure” (setting, episodes, resolution, and coda). 12We construe the terms top-down and bottom-up differently from analyses of discourse that focus on textual comprehension and interpretation (e.g., CitationFletcher, Arthur, & Skeate, 1995; CitationKintsch, 1998; Citationvan Dijk & Kintsch, 1983). Our conception is closer to CitationKarmiloff-Smith (1983, Citation1986b), who construes bottom-up processing as procedural or data-driven, in contrast to the later-developing ability to superimpose top-down organizational strategies on the component parts, here, of a text as a unit of discourse. 13Our use of these terms departs from Chomsky's (1965) distinction between competence as underlying knowledge of (linguistic) structure compared with performance as use of this knowledge in behavior, for language comprehension and production. For us, the line between competence and performance is “not only flexible and fuzzy, but bi-directional. Knowledge of linguistic forms and narrative structure clearly underlies the ability to tell a story; but the act of storytelling impinges on this knowledge across development … in becoming a proficient interpreter and teller of stories” (CitationBerman, 1995, p. 308; also see CitationReilly, 1992). 14Other studies in the cross-linguistic project showed that, with age, these departures occurred increasingly in openings as well as codas (CitationBerman & Katzenberger, 2004; CitationTolchinsky, Johansson, & Zamora, 2002). 15The only departure from fully generalized statements in the expository texts of fourth and seventh graders was use of an expression such as I think in the fourth-grade essay in (2) as a general marker of transitions from one part of a piece of discourse to the next across the children's expository texts in different languages, for example, in French, je trouve; in Spanish, creo; and in Hebrew ani xoshev ‘I think’ (CitationKatzenberger, 2004). 16Scores ranged from 0 to 4 for Levels 0, I, II, III, and IV, with an additional score of 2.5 for the 6 “in-between” cases out of the 160 texts in the sample (all in expository texts and all between Levels II and III). 17A range of analyses from this large-scale project are summed up in special issues of two journals edited by CitationBerman (2005a) and CitationBerman and Verhoeven (2002). 18We applied identical analyses to 160 texts in the Hebrew sample of the cross-linguistic project (with 90% interjudge reliability, κ = 0.91). A Kruskal–Wallis test revealed no significant difference between the results for Hebrew and those reported here for English by either age or genre. Moreover, a study comparing comprehension of Hebrew narrative and expository texts in the same age groups (Kaplan, in progress) yields a similar disparity between the two genres, although a ceiling was reached for comprehension of both types by high school, in line with the fact that comprehension tends to precede and outstrip production across development.",0,1
"Letters to Language Paul M. Postal and Derek Bickerton Language accepts letters from readers that briefly and succinctly respond to or comment upon either material published previously in the journal or issues deemed of importance to the field. The editor reserves the right to edit letters as needed. Brief replies from relevant parties are included as warranted. A historical corrective January 22, 2005 To the Editor: These remarks concern intellectual credit for certain ideas in Ch. 6 of my book, Skeptical linguistic essays (New York: Oxford University Press), published in January 2004, credit which should have been given but due largely to faulty memory on my part was not. I am greatly indebted for this opportunity to set the record straight in the pages of Language.1 In going through some old boxes of papers in mid-2004, I discovered a handwritten letter to me from a former lifetime member of the Linguistic Society of America (LSA) named Lester A. Rice. The secretariat of the LSA has since informed me that, unfortunately, Mr. Rice died in 1994. He was apparently one of the students in a large syntax class I gave at an LSA summer institute at Indiana University in the summer of 1964. I reproduce here most of his letter, including everything relevant to the issues at hand. I note that he indicates in his letter that he had dropped out of linguistics and was then living in Spain. Letter from Lester A. Rice to Paul M. Postal (May 15, 1986) Dear Paul: With regard to Terry’s and your The vastness of natural languages,2 which I haven’t seen and know only through Abbott’s review in Lg.,3 I would like to add a couple of observations which I believe bear on vastness and even greater vastness. Notice that in indirect quotes in English the quoted material appears in well-formed English, generally. However, in direct quotes there seems to be little or no constraint that the quoted material be well-formed, or in English, or limited in any way as to length, or even be ‘linguistic’ (this letter if we include written material). In particular, I can cite a sentence recently published in an article in Lg.,4 slightly paraphrased: The man asked the woman what she had for lunch and she answered [sakatsho:ri nii] and he replied [A:ke ki’ na:’a tsi nikanutaraku] and a further discussion of soup followed. Since there is no restriction on what follows the words ‘answered’ and ‘replied’, we are free to insert at each of these points the entire set or collection (for instance) of the sentences of ns; etc. And in general a simple sentence of any one NL [natural language] can contain, in this way, at once, all other NLs, in addition perhaps to much else. Even on a level of sentence production and interpretation, folklore tales permit a narrator to create personages and their dialog; in this way a linguistically sophisticated narrator has the power and knowledge in principle to represent or imply representing in some fashion all NLs. (In finite terms, this would mean by token and by ‘Selbstverstandlichkeit’.) Thus, ‘He said “X”’, where X represents all earthly NLs past present and future, plus all NLs which by their nature will never cross the human mind, is merely a single S of English. It’s an impeccable and simple S of English. Each NL must at once contain every other NL. Paragraph two of the letter makes abundantly clear that Mr. Rice had observed one of the key factual bases for the conclusions of Ch. 6 of my book. He had noticed in particular that there are well-formed sentences in natural language L some of whose parts are not composed of elements drawn from any conceivable lexicon or morpheme listing of L. He gave such an English sentence in which the two parts not drawn from the English lexicon each involve elements of the Iroquoian language Mohawk. In Ch. 6 I cited several other classes of facts which support parallel inferences about natural language and concluded inter alia that on these bases alone, natural languages cannot have generative (proof-theoretic) grammars...",0,1
"Aims and objectives: The aim of this scoping review is to investigate the association between bilingualism in the family and child subjective well-being, by reviewing the literature to identify key themes to date and remaining questions for future research. Methodology: Scopus, Web of Knowledge, ERIC, Psych Articles and PsychInfo were searched systematically between September and October 2018, and after title, abstract and full-text screening, 17 of the initial 1433 articles were included in this review. Data and analysis: Each study was coded for the discipline from which it emerged, the language combination studied, the measures of well-being and language proficiency it used, the geographical location of the study and the number of participants. Data on the link between bilingualism and well-being was extracted from each study. Findings and conclusion: Two main themes were identified: ‘The effect of language proficiency on family relationships’ and ‘The acculturation of parents and children as mediated by language’. Across studies, there was significant heterogeneity in definition of concepts and a diverse range of measures employed. In addition, the studies identified suggest a positive link between minority language maintenance and child well-being, and a positive influence of bilingualism, rather than knowledge of only the home or the majority language. However, the directionality of these relationships will need to be investigated in future research. Originality: This is the first scoping review conducted systematically to explore the link between bilingualism in the family and child well-being internationally. It builds on previous work such as a narrative review which examined this association in the European context.",0,1
"This paper is a response to Yaron Matras’s article ‘Duly verified? Language analysis in UK asylum applications of Syrian refugees’. Matras evaluates 50 reports by the Stockholm-based agency Verified AB. He introduces his own approach, which he calls ‘inductive-dialectological’, and claims that it addresses many of the problems in Verified’s approach. We respond on a number of fronts. We interpret the role and duty of the expert performing language analysis in the asylum procedure as essentially the same as that of a forensic expert in criminal law. We argue that Matras’s approach fails to adhere to principles of sound forensic evidence, thereby risking biased conclusions. Furthermore, we contend that Matras’s view on the question to be addressed is not in line with the trier of fact’s requirements. We also consider the need for a fixed conclusion scale, the institutional demands driving casework and the large number of disparate conclusions among experts. We conclude with some advice to asylum courts and LAAP practitioners.",0,1
"ASPECTS OF METHAPHORICAL DEFINITION IN THE SCIENCES Willian Frawley 1.Introduction In their classic essay on the structure of definition in natural languages, Manfred Bierwisch and Ferenc Kiefer (1970) remark that consideration of the types of sentences which occur in definitions might not only be instructive as to the character of ordinary language definitions, but ""might also shed some light on the complex problem of the character and development of systems of theory-bound terms"" (Bierwisch and Kiefer, 1970:76). That is, a systematic unpacking of the problem of ordinary language definitions may be revealing about the structure of meaning in specialized discourse: science in particular. It is the purpose of this paper to take Bierwisch and Kiefer's suggestion as imperative and to look at the structure of definitions in scientific lexicons, focusing especially on the character of metaphorical definitions in science. To do this, I first consider the nature and function of metaphorical expressions in science to justify scientific metaphors as objects worth studying and to see what sort of information might have to be codified by the lexicographer of science. Thereafter, I discuss the structure of scientific definitions, emphasizing the logic of metaphorical definition to demonstrate how metaphorical definitions represent the semantic functions of metaphor in scientific discourse in general. 2.Metaphor in Scientific Discourse One of the most important legacies of the demise of logical empiricist metascience is the realization that science is not a rigidly referential discourse which reduces all of its terms to ostensión. That scientific discourse is shot through with imprecision, ambiguity , approximate meaning, and metaphor has been the essential claim of numerous post-empiricist philosophers of science. Pepper (1942) articulated quite early the position that every explanatory system has at its base a ""root metaphor"" which organizes the hypotheses of the discipline seeking to explain the world. Seventeenth century mechanism and nineteenth century organicism 118 William Frawley1 19 The second problem of the definiens which is relevant here is its openness. If one looks cursorily through a specialized lexicon, one sees great variability in the length of the definientes. Why is this? The answer, I think, lies in the type of definition. Substitutive and reductive definientes are closed. Since they introduce no new information into the definition, the definientes have a limit. This is obvious for substitutive definientes, which function only to provide alternate nomenclature and which terminate after the introduction of the synonym. But it is not so obvious for reductive definientes. Consider the definiens of ""bolometric correction"" from the astrophysics glossary: ""the visual (or photovisual) magnitude minus the bolometric magnitude of a star. It is always a positive number"" (Hopkins, 1980:19). Why does the definiens stop there? Because a reductive definiens is found in a complete definition, the meaning of the definiendum can be expressed totally: the concept which the definiendum represents is completely known in astrophysics, and the reductive definiens reaches its limit when the definiendum is fully explicated (in fact, because it is fully explicated). This is not true for metaphorical definitions, whose definientes are open because of the fact that they introduce new information. Consider the term ""black hole"" in astrophysics; it is defined by Hopkins (1980:18) as follows: A black hole partitions three-demensional space into two regions: an inner region bounded by a smooth two-dimensional surface (called the horizon), and the region outside the horizon which is asymptotically flat. The essential characteristic of a black hole is that the inner region cannot communicate with the outer region: i.e., light cannot escape from it. It can be said that at the horizon the gravitational field is so strong that even light cannot escape. For a spherically symmetric black hole radius of the horizon is 2GM/c2 — sometimes called the Schwartzschild radius. If an object with the mass of the Sun has a radius of 2.5 km, it would be a black hole. Black holes represent one of the possible endpoints of stellar evolution for stars very much more massive than the Chandresekhar limit. Good black hole candidates: Cygnus X-I, Circinus X-I, and V861 Scorpii. 120Metaphorical Definition in the Sciences As is well known from popularized astronomy, a black...",0,1

"Este trabajo ofrece una revision sobre las maneras de concebir el lexico y el funcionamiento de la interfaz lexico-sintaxis en el enfoque neoconstruccionista, en oposicion al enfoque lexicalista. En este sentido, se revisa el concepto de raiz –que en los modelos de corte neoconstruccionista no codifica ningun tipo de informacion gramatical– y se estudia cuales son los mecanismos que regulan la insercion de las piezas lexicas en la estructura sintactica, para comprobar que hay divergencias dentro del propio enfoque neoconstruccionista. Asimismo, se analiza como y donde se definen la Estructura Argumental y la Estructura Eventiva de los predicados verbales y algunas formaciones deverbales en distintos modelos teoricos no lexicalistas –Morfologia Distribuida, Borer 2005a, 2005b, 2012, 2013 o Ramchand 2008, entre otros–, con la intencion de volver sobre el problema que toda teoria neoconstruccionista plantea y que es determinar hasta donde llega la especificacion sintactica y semantica de las estructuras y que aspectos se reservan para la parte enciclopedica y el uso concreto propio de cada lengua.",0,1

"People often use memes to express their ideological stance on real world events. This study departs from a recent COVID-19-related meme which makes use of elements known from the animated television series Avatar: The Last Airbender (ATLA) and Avatar: Legend of Korra (LOK), and asks how it came to be and how stance is conveyed through them. After acknowledging the impact of the series, conceptual blending theory is adopted to investigate the worldbuilding of the macrocosm in ATLA. This is identified as a correlative network, which acts as the blended space of multiple input spaces consisting of intertextual references. The world of ATLA then functions as a new input space which is updated with modern elements, resulting in the blend of LOK. Minor blends are identified in the hybrid animals that occupy the fictional world. Lastly, it is shown how the selection of a particular input element for participation in meme blends already conveys an ideological stance, rather than only emerging through readers’ eyes.",0,1
"Abstract The English language is seen by the Chinese as a tool of significant pragmatic value, both by the individual and the state. Discourse on English language education within China has, both historically and at present, pitted the pragmatic value of English against concerns of cultural and linguistic erosion and imposition. Concerns over the corrupting impact the English language may have on the Chinese language, and further on Chinese culture, uneasily coexist with an acceptance of the English language’s role as the key to modernization and economic development. Voices of past and present, have at their core a desire for the protection of a reified cultural identity or essence. However, cultural and linguistic influence has not merely been imposed upon China from external forces, but has been actively drawn in by domestic forces. Such domestic forces range from foreign language education policies that meet the demands of a globalized market-driven economy, to a market demand for English language media such as TV programs, movies and literature. Ultimately, the presence and significance of these domestic forces undermines a view of the English language as a vehicle of cultural imperialism in China.",0,1

"Speakers of different languages perceive time differently depending on various factors such as age, pace of life, religion, time of day, and even pregnancy. In recent years, studies have shown that this is the case even within one same language community. This article presents research showing that doctors in China differ in their perception of time, based on their specific background training, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) or Western medicine (WM), even when both categories speak the same mother tongue. An initial questionnaire showed that TCM doctors were significantly more vertically oriented than WM doctors. To test these findings’ generalizability, we designed a spatial priming experiment (using horizontal and vertical pictures as priming stimuli) to obtain reaction time and accuracy of the doctors’ response on horizontal and vertical questions. TCM doctors showed significantly shorter reaction times and higher accuracy rates than WM doctors when answering vertical questions. These results confirmed the findings of our first survey. Overall, this study provides support for the hypothesis that background training affects the perception of time succession.",0,1

"La majorité des théories syntaxiques traitent de l’écrit. Il s’ensuit que les théories de l’acquisition de la langue maternelle, comme la théorie chomskyenne, sont fondées sur ce modèle de l’écrit. Pourtant c’est le langage parlé spontané que l’enfant acquiert en premier ; c’est seulement plus tard que l’enfant apprend l’écrit. Malgré les études récentes sur le langage parlé spontané, les analystes qui distinguent langage planifié et non-planifié et les différentes dimensions de la syntaxe et du lexique, ne semblent pas reconnaître l’étendue des différences entre la syntaxe du langage écrit formel et le langage parlé spontané non-planifié.

"Notre etude vise una analyse contrastive des constructions presentationnelles existentielles dans trois langues romanes, a savoir il y a en francais, hay en espagnol et c’e en italien. 

Le travail se place dans une tradition particulierement longue et riche d’etudes sur les constructions existentielles. Neanmoins, nous sommes loin de disposer deja d’un consensus relatif sur les differents problemes envisages, en particulier en ce qui concerne le statut du constituant locatif. A notre connaissance, jusqu’a present il n’existe aucune etude empirique qui aborde specifiquement le comportement du locatif dans les constructions existentielles. Nous nous proposons de combler cette lacune. 
La demarche suivie s’ecarte de celle qu’adoptent la plupart des etudes consacrees aux constructions existentielles dans les langues romanes, par le fait que nous aborderons le comportement du locatif (a) hors de tout cadre theorique predefini, (b) a partir d’une analyse empirique dans un corpus ecrit et (c) dans une perspective resolument interlinguistique.
Notre etude se compose de deux volets comportant chacun quatre chapitres. 

Le premier volet presente les constructions presentationnelles existentielles en espagnol, en francais et en italien a partir de perspectives linguistiques aussi diverses que la morphologie (chapitre 1), la pragmatique du discours (chapitre 2), la semantique (chapitre 3) et la syntaxe (chapitre 4). Il s’avere tout au long de cette premiere partie de notre etude que le role qu’il faut attribuer au locatif dans la construction existentielle souleve des discussions interessantes tant sur le plan morphologique, que pragmatique, semantique et syntaxique. 

Dans le deuxieme volet de cette etude, nous proposons une perspective comparative de cette problematique si controversee en linguistique theorique a partir d’une analyse empirique des CPE en francais, en espagnol et en italien. Apres une breve introduction dans laquelle nous motiverons nos criteres de recherche, le chapitre 5 etudie la presence de locatifs spatio-temporels dans la CPE. Il s’avere que dans les trois langues etudiees les locatifs spatio-temporels ne figurent que dans un tiers des occurrences, meme s’ils sont souvent implicites. 
Ensuite, nous examinons le positionnement des locatifs dans la CPE. Le chapitre 6 fournit une description detaillee du positionnement des locatifs spatiaux et temporels, alors que le chapitre 7 decrit le positionnement des localisateurs holonymiques, adnominaux, mediatifs, beneficiaires et organisationnels. Les parametres examines sont (a) le statut discursif du locatif, (b) sa nature semantique et (c) sa structure interne. Progressivement et de facon systematique, nous mettons en evidence qu’il existe aussi bien des tendances communes aux langues romanes, a savoir le dynamisme communicatif, que des evolutions particulieres opposant en particulier le francais d’un cote a l’espagnol et a l’italien de l’autre. Ainsi il semble que les trois langues considerees reagissent differemment face aux exigences thematiques posees par la construction existentielle. La ou en italien et en espagnol les localisateurs cadratifs apparaissent de generalement devant le verbe existentiel, en francais ces localisateurs apparaissent souvent en position intercalee (et meme finale). Il y a semble donc avoir tendance a se mettre en tete de l’enonce. Enfin, dans le chapitre 8, nous proposons une explication au positionnement different des localisateurs dans la CPE francaise en il y a en termes de grammaticalisation. Nous posons en particulier que il y a fonctionne dans une large mesure comme un signe introducteur fige plutot que comme un veritable predicat d’existence, ce par quoi tous les elements de la proposition le suivent logiquement. En italien et en espagnol la locution n’aurait pas perdu dans la meme mesure son statut de predicat verbal et assumerait davantage la fonction semantique de verbe d’existence. L’application des six criteres de grammaticalisation de Lehmann (1995) a permis de mettre en evidence differents faits empiriques etayant une telle interpretation. Une telle analyse se confirme par le fait qu’il existe d’autres domaines dans lesquels les langues romanes se sont grammaticalisees a des degres differents et ou le francais est considerablement en tete devant l’espagnol et l’italien. En effet, la grammaticalisation plus poussee de il y a en tant que morpheme introducteur s’inscrit sans doute dans l’evolution syntaxique propre au francais qui a grammaticalise l’ordre syntaxique SV(O). 

De ce qui precede il resulte que le comportement different des locatifs dans la CPE dans les trois langues ne peut se comprendre qu’a partir d’une analyse complexe, qui prend en compte les differents niveaux syntaxiques, semantiques et pragmatiques et leur interaction variable a travers les langues. Par cette etude, nous avons souhaite contribuer a une reflexion sur l’interaction differente de ces aspects de la grammaire. Ainsi il apparait qu’en italien la pression thematique theme-rheme domine, alors qu’en francais c’est la pression syntaxique SV qui s’impose. L’espagnol occupe une position intermediaire mais se rapproche nettement plus de l’italien que du francais. A travers l'etude du comportement des locatifs spatio-temporels dans la CPE, il est donc apparu une fois de plus combien l’interaction entre syntaxe et pragmatique du discours peut differer meme entre des langues si etroitement liees que les langues romanes. Nous osons esperer que cette etude contribue modestement a eclairer cette matiere complexe.",0,1
"This study examined the syntactic impairments of Chinese Alzheimer’s disease patients with a dependency network approach. The dependency treebanks and dependency networks are constructed from the discourses of both the patient group and its healthy peers. By analysing the contrasts in the dependency networks of the two groups, we found that 1) the mean dependency distance (MDD) of the AD group is shorter than that of the HP group; furthermore, the MDDs of both AD and HP groups are far below the standard Chinese MDD; 2) the content words like remember, forget, know, etc. and the negative forms of the verbs like don’t know, can’t remember, can’t say, etc. show highly repetitive uncertain and negative expressions that are typical of the predicates of the clauses of AD patients; 3) the function word vertices in the AD dependency network have distinctive network parameters such as higher ‘betweenness’ centrality, closeness centrality, and clustering coefficients, etc., indicating that the syntax of AD is impaired and features more simplified stereotypes. These results indicate that the syntax of the AD group has been impaired from parts of speech to the whole syntactic structure.",0,1

We evaluate some of the theoretical and empirical research in this area and propose a reassessment of the nature of type-shifting operations.

We also argue that the putative underspecification (or indeterminacy) of type-shifting constructions is resolved via pragmatic inferences.

"Comparative constructions like More people have been to Russia than I have are reported to be acceptable and meaningful by native speakers of English; yet, upon closer reflection, they are judged to be incoherent. This mismatch between initial perception and more considered judgment challenges the idea that we perceive sentences veridically, and interpret them fully; it is thus potentially revealing about the relationship between grammar and language processing. This paper presents the results of the first detailed investigation of these so-called ‘comparative illusions’. We test four hypotheses about their source: a shallow syntactic parser, some type of repair by ellipsis, an incorrectly-resolved lexical ambiguity, or a persistent event comparison interpretation. Two formal acceptability studies show that speakers are most prone to the illusion when the matrix clause supports an event comparison reading. A verbatim recall task tests and finds evidence for such construals in speakers’ recollections of the sentences. We suggest that this reflects speakers’ entertaining an interpretation that is initially consistent with the sentence, but failing to notice when this interpretation becomes unavailable at the than-clause. In particular, semantic knowledge blinds people to an illicit operator-variable configuration in the syntax. Rather than illustrating processing in the absence of grammatical analysis, comparative illusions thus underscore the importance of syntactic and semantic rules in sentence processing.",0,1
"Illustrations Michael Hancher ""To be known it must be seen.""1 The Prospectus for the Century, published the same year as the first volume ofthe dictionary (1889), boasted that: Over 5,000 cuts have been made (many of them illustrating rare and curious objects never before pictured) which, taken together, are believed to convey more, and more trustworthy, pictorial information about the things described than any other similar collection.2 It reported these guidelines: In the selection of the pictorial illustrations, the aim of the Century Dictionary has been to give such as shall be practically useful as a direct aid to the definitions, technically accurate and artistically exact. To secure these results, the cuts have been selected by the specialists themselves, and have been drawn direcdy from the objects to be illustrated , or have been obtained from authoritative sources; and both the drawings and the proofs ofthe engraved figures have been submitted to the specialists for their approval. The attainment of a high artistic quality is guaranteed by the general character of the art work done by The Century Co. (8) This last remark alludes to the outstanding reputation that The Century Co. had achieved for the illustrations it published in the Owtury Magazine, which had been founded in 1870 as Scribner's Magazine. :From the publisher's note prefacing the colored plates in the Century (edition of 1903), discussed below. 2P. 8. An early reviewer put the number at 6,000 ( The Critic, 12 April 1890, 177; see also 19July 1890, 28). John (1981, 135) also gives the figure as 6,000. 80Michael Hancher Thanks to the aesthetic interests of the editor, Richard Watson Gilder (1844-1909); to the resourcefulness ofthe art director, Alexander W. Drake (1843-1916), and his associate William Lewis Fraser (1841-1905); and to the painstaking care of Theodore Low De Vinne (1828-1914), who supervised the printing ofbothjournals (as well as ofthe Century), The Century Co. had become renowned internationally for the quality of its illustrations, almost all of which were finely detailed wood engravings .3 A remark elsewhere in the Prospectus hints that at least some of the illustrations in the Century were meant to entertain as well as instruct . Although the Century would be unprecedentedly rigorous in reporting the technical nomenclature of biology and zoology, ""the popular side of the work has also been carefully attended to, and abundant information about animals of all kinds has been given, accompanied by finely executed pictorial illustrations"" (7). Near the end of his Preface to the first volume of the Century, the editor, William Dwight Whitney (1827-1894), stated that ""[t]he pictorial illustrations have been so selected and executed as to be subordinate to the text, while possessing a considerable degree of independent suggestiveness and artistic value.""4 This paradoxical formula, acknowl3John 80-83. Fraser, not Drake, was in charge ofthe illustrations for the Century: the Preface to the first volume reported that ""the general direction of this artistic work has been intrusted to Mr. W. Lewis Fraser, manager of the Art Department ofthe Century Co."" (xvi) . Fraser hadjoined the art department ""in the early 1880s."" ""The division of power between these two chiefs was not explicit, but Fraser evidently handled layouts and helped Drake in negotiations with illustrators "" (John 181). Ellsworth explains that Roswell Smith, the founder and president ofThe Century Co., was very diplomatic when he brought in Fraser to help Drake. There was some question as to the exact status of each, and Mr. Smith had two signs painted, ""A.W. Drake, Art Superintendent,"" and ""W. Lewis Fraser, Art Manager."" That settled it.

"1. The observations which follow' are not primarily concerned with the signe zero in descriptive linguistics, with zero allomorphs within morphemes, or with zero morphemes within paradigms. Nor are they concerned with the problem of dealing with pauses or of setting up segments without body or even duration but still with recognizable attributes, as is the case with junctures. Those are special cases where a state of affairs otherwise ignored, namely the absence of any segment, acquires special importance. In passing we also note the opposite instance: empty morphs disappear from the picture as we pass to higher and relevant levels of grammar, and the same is true in phonology of transitional stretches like glides and releases whose occurrence can be regarded as predictable and which therefore vanish in the act of phonemicizing. There are, however, other contexts which demand introduction of the factor Nothing-or as I shall call it, in order to avoid Polyphemus' predicament, NIL. One such context arises in historical work. No theory of change can do without nil. Consider the terms loss, contraction, obsolescence, syncope, ...; neologism, anaptyxis, diphthongization, ...-a motley group, but one in which the notion of disappearance or fresh emergence of nil, as either goal or starting point, is everywhere implicit.",0,1

We begin with a brief overview of how dictionaries have been used in the NLP community, particularly to introduce semantic knowledge in NLP systems.

We then argue that the task of Definition Modeling, which consists of generating dictionary definitions from word embeddings, is well suited to studying these limitations and highlight how current issues in automated evaluation of NLP systems specifically hinder this investigation.",0,1

He links them to background variables from 1579 multilinguals from around the world, including the speaker's history in learning the LX, its present use, and the linguistic, social, educational, and psychological profile of the multilingual speaker.Textbooks lack emotion words, and this indeed leaves LX learners and users unprepared when they enter a LX community. Research on how bilinguals and multilinguals communicate emotions is therefore of vital interest. This study is based on an online questionnaire, the Bilingualism and Emotion Questionnaire (BEQ -included in the appendix of the book) with closed and open-ended questions, and interview sessions with 20 bi- and multilinguals which were subsequently used to assess the importance of cultural factors and the effect of the acculturation process with regard to the preferred language for communicating emotion. This is the first large-scale study on how bi- and multilinguals communicate emotion.In the first chapter, 'Perspectives on Emotion', the author presents the distinct areas of research on emotion in both monolingual and multilingual contexts and provides the reader with background information on various approaches to emotion. The perspectives on emotion given are the neurobiological perspective, the cognitive linguistic approach, the cultural psychological approaches, and the social constructivist approach. The writer focuses on self-reports from multilinguals about their expression of emotion in various languages. Dewaele emphasizes the importance of creating a positive learning environment to enhance language learning motivation. In addition, Dewaele indicates that there is a lack of work in the field of interlanguage pragmatics on how LX users recognize and express emotions in their LX(s).In Chapter 2, Dewaele elaborates on the 'Epistemological and Methodological Perspectives in SLA and Multilingualism Research'. He emphasizes the fact that the domain of communicating emotion in a LX situates itself at the intersection of different disciplines within social sciences. He mentions that although each individual learner is inevitably unique, they all share interacting psychological, social, cultural, and biological characteristics. He defends combined emics and etics in SLA and multilingualism research. In addition, researchers should consider the limitations of purely quantitative approaches, which cannot reveal the main reasons for existing specific patterns, and of qualitative approaches, where results are harder to generalize. Dewaele also explains the importance of interdisciplinary studies in SLA and multilingualism research. His mixed method approach, combining qualitative and quantitative analysis, strengthens the validity and reliability of the analyses.Chapter 3 explains the methodological approach, research questions, and hypotheses. It provides the reader with detailed information about the BEQ questions. Participants spoke a total of 71 different L1s (first languages). He proposes eight hypotheses and predicts 'a monotonic decline from L1-L5' (p. 49) in self-perceived competence, frequency of language use, attitude, and perception score and a gradual increase in Foreign Language Anxiety (FLA) from L1 to L5. He argues that the dependent variables could be linked to age of onset of acquisition, context of acquisition, frequency of use of the LX, socialization in the LX users, size of network of interlocutors, number of languages known, Trait Emotional Intelligence, gender, age, and education. …",0,1

"Abstract This paper analyses postings made by student applicants on Korean online communities about how best to handle interactions with potential future PhD supervisors at UK universities. The questions they posed reveal the lack of relevant contextual information they experienced, especially around the rights and obligations of supervisors. This paper thus analyses students’ metapragmatic comments and argues for greater attention to be paid within interpersonal and intercultural pragmatics to interactional goals and conceptions of role relations, especially the rights and obligations associated with them. The analysis has revealed that background information on role relations is of great importance for relational management and communication planning in high stakes intercultural interaction. This suggests that potential cultural variation in the perceived rights and obligations associated with a given role (in this case, PhD supervisor) and their implications for assessments of role relations are of central concern.",0,1
"Trauma experience is understood through its expression in language, with implications for psycholinguistic and clinical research and analysis. Clinical research approaches often approach childhood trauma through investigative, semi-structured, retrospective interviews (e.g. Childhood Experience of Care and Abuse, CECA). This facilitates the narration of abuse history for systematic analysis in relation to clinical disorder. Interview techniques assist such history-telling, for example by ‘scaffolding’ the account, aiding memory through chronological questioning, using a factual focus and using probing questions to collect detail and resolve inconsistencies. However, some personal narratives are fragmented, incomplete, contradictory or highly emotional/dissociated from emotion. This can be explained by trauma impacts such as being emotionally frozen (forgetting and avoidance) or overwhelmed (emotional over-remembering) and is termed ‘unresolved trauma’ with links to attachment vulnerability. These narratives can make investigative interview research more challenging but can offer opportunities for secondary psycholinguistic analysis. Illustrative interview quotes from CECA childhood physical and sexual abuse narratives of three women are provided with comment on style of reporting. The women had recurrent trauma experience and later life depression and anxiety. The interview responses are examined in terms of seven characteristics taken from available literature (e.g. incoherent, contradictory, lack recall, time lapses, emotionality, blame and vividness). The concept of unresolved loss is discussed and whether the linguistic characteristics are specific to a trauma or to an individual. Factual investigative interviews and psycholinguistic analysis of narrative may find ways of combining for greater depth of understanding of unresolved trauma, to extend available methods and aid therapy.",0,1
"Reviewed by: The Syntax of Hungarian Edward J. Vajda Katalin É. Kiss . The Syntax of Hungarian. In the series Cambridge Syntax Guides. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. 2002. Pp. xii + 278. US$70.00 (hardcover), $26.00 (paperback). For a variety of reasons, this monograph should be considered together with an earlier volume on Hungarian syntax co-edited by the same author (Kiefer and É. Kiss 1994). Both books follow a generative framework, yet both seek first and foremost to account for the broadest possible variety of syntactic structures rather than elaborate upon the latest theoretical flourishes. Both are also complementary in that each deals with a largely non-overlapping set of problems of formal interest to syntacticians. And taken together, the two books cover a great deal of descriptive ground and make excellent companions to the more traditional presentation of Hungarian syntax found in Kenesei, Vago and Fenyvesi (1997), the most comprehensive reference grammar of Hungarian currently available to English speakers. [End Page 133] As part of the series Cambridge Syntax Guides, É. Kiss's new Syntax of Hungarian is essential to anyone interested in gaining an empirical grounding in the syntactic intricacies of a non-Indo-European language. The approach taken largely reflects the one used in a recent teacher's reference manual Új magyar nyelvtan (New Hungarian Grammar) bý E. Kiss, Kiefer and Siptár (1998), which presented the basic facts of Hungarian syntax on a more practical descriptive level. However, because this book was written in Hungarian, it has remained inaccessible to most generative grammarians. Following a brief introduction (Chapter 1, pp. 1–7), where the author explains the basic features of Hungarian grammar, each of the book's subsequent nine chapters covers a specific theoretical topic. The choice of topics is regulated in part by which facets of Hungarian sentence structure offer the greatest challenge to contemporary grammatical theories; but also by what topics were not covered in Kiefer and É. Kiss (1994), which, for example, devoted considerable space to issues of phrase structure. The new volume is oriented instead around pragmatic (discourse-related) aspects of sentence constituency. Two key chapters are devoted to components of the language's system of functional sentence perspective. Chapter 2 (pp. 8–26) discusses the fact that Hungarian sentences are fundamentally organised around a division between topic and predicate. Unlike English, the sentence subject need not fulfil the role of topic. This principle echoes the author's numerous earlier publications, and ultimately derives from the nineteenth-century linguist Samuel Brassai (1860, 1863–1865). Brassai was the first to discover that word order in Hungarian sentences is based on a division between a topic, which varies as to the actual phrase-structure element that fulfills it, and some predication about that topic. The discourse configuration of Hungarian sentence structure has major implications for a host of more specific syntactic features. Chapter 4 (pp. 77–104) deals with the role that focusing plays in configuring the order of elements within the predicate. Focused elements, as well as other verbal operators (question words, indefinite pronouns, etc.), obligatorily occupy the position immediately to the left of the finite verb itself. Some chapters appear to repeat material already covered in Kiefer and É. Kiss (1994). But this is actually not the case, since the new analysis is always directed at additional aspects of the problems, with an eye toward insights provided by recent theoretical advances. The author gives the appropriate credit for innovations she has adopted from other scholars in her acknowledgements (pp. xi–xii) and throughout the discussion, so that the reader can gain a broad understanding of the breadth of current investigations into Hungarian syntax. Coverage of the noun phrase (Chapter 7, pp. 151–180) adds a new discussion of noun phrase projections, the structure of possessive constructions, and non-possessor arguments in the noun phrase. The extensive coverage of subordination and coordination in the earlier book is supplemented here by additional treatment of relative and adverbial clauses, as well as by a discussion of parasitic gaps (Chapter 10, pp. 230–263). The remaining chapters explore additional structural principles that follow from the basic topic-predicate configuration within the Hungarian sentence. Chapter 3 (pp. 27– 76), entitled ""The...",0,1
"This article explores the contribution of Angelina Parker to the making of the English Dialect Dictionary. Relying on EDD Online (Markus 2019a), the aim is to analyze the impact of Parker on the Oxfordshire element of the dictionary by scrutinizing the entries where Wright relied on her first-hand knowledge of the dialect for ascriptions, definitions, and senses. The article is framed within forensic dictionary analysis (Coleman and Ogilvie 2009) and takes a quantitative and qualitative approach to the data retrieved from EDD Online, with particular reference to the entries that include Parker's initials and those in which Wright quoted from the manuscript words she sent to him (now Bodl. MS Eng. lang. d. 69–74). The findings indicate that Wright reproduced faithfully from Parker's material, which he employed for citation purposes, and relied on her as the sole authority for a significant number of words, senses, and examples of the Oxfordshire distribution of an item. A connoisseur of the Oxfordshire dialect, Parker undertook her own lexicographical projects and collaborated with other dialectologists, including Alexander John Ellis and Thomas Hallam. This article seeks to cast further light on the role of correspondents in the English Dialect Dictionary, while giving Parker a deserved place in the histories of English dialectology, the Oxfordshire dialect, and women's lexicography more generally.",0,1
"766 LANGUAGE, VOLUME 54, NUMBER 3 (1978) negativity of the quantifiers seldom, hardly, little, and few in English, and sallen, knappast, lite, and fâ in Swedish. Details of the actual test design and additional graphs are provided in the appendices. The study is divided into three parts: (1) the English Experiment (EE), (2) the Swedish Experiment (SE), and (3) an analysis comparing the two sets of data. Of the paradigms used in the experiments, T writes: 'The criterion for negativity was use of neither in an appended tag sentence in English, and inte heller in Swedish. The use of jo or det ... ocksâ counted as positive interpretations. The method adopted in EE was a completion test. The subjects .. . were asked to complete a base-plus-tag pair of the following type: ""I seldom drink tea ... does my brother."" The assumption was that the subjects would make the tag sentence either negative or positive, thus giving evidence of their interpretation of the base sentence.' In the SE, a different technique was adopted to arrive at a paradigm that best approximated the English paradigm semantically. The Swedish speakers were confronted with two lines like these : (24)Jag dricker sallen te. Min bror dricker sallen te! (25)Jag dricker sallen te, och det gör ... The speakers were then asked to complete the sentence in 25 so that it preserved the meaning of the two sentences in 24. From the resulting data, T made percentage conversions and reached the following conclusions : (1) differences do exist in the relationship between individual quantifiers within the two language systems; (2) differences in negativity between related Swedish and English quantifiers do occur (negativity is defined here as the force of a specific quantifier to confer negativity on a sentence); and (3) a greater diversity occurs among Swedish quantifiers in terms of negative force than among the English counterparts. In the last chapter, T relates her own findings to those from previous studies, and although she offers no 'precise formulation of a non-discrete theory on negation', she does give some suggestions on the classification of the negative quantifier. She prefers to view negative quantifiers as arranged along a continuum according to degree of negativity, instead of divided in the discrete classes, strong and weak, proposed by Klima. T suggests that the negative quantifiers might be considered members of the 'fuzzy set'. T offers no immediate solution to the problem of defining negative quantifiers; however, this insightful study weaves several different models together, yielding a neat discussion and summary of proposed theories of negation and negative quantifiers. [Gay Bradshaw, University of California, Santa Barbara.] Nederlandse dialektatlassen. Edited by E. Blancquaert and W. Pee. Antwerp : Uitgeverij De Sikkel, 1925-77. 32 volumes. This is a series of dialect atlases of the entire Dutch-speaking area, comprising The Netherlands and the northern half of Belgium. It was initiated a half-century ago by Blancquaert at the University of Gent, according to the methods then current. This monumental project, carried out over the years by nineteen principal investigators, is now announced as complete. The project was based, from outset to finish, on a single set of 141 sentences. These were originally composed with rural Catholic Flanders in mind; this fact was occasionally to prove awkward in the mainly Protestant North. The obvious advantage gained in deciding to retain the same sentences is that everything transcribed can be compared over the entire area. The sentences are intended to elicit vocabulary items, some morphology, and a few syntactic features such as subordinate clauses. The entire area of investigation was divided, for the purposes of organization and publication , into sixteen districts of an approximately equal number of localities, the average being between 100 and 150. Simple multiplication shows that, in a geographical area ofjust over 20,000 square miles, we have a dense network of 2000 or more localities in which all 141 sentences have been transcribed. The actual publication consists, for each district, of two boxes made in the form of outsize volumes. The first contains the questionnaire, introductory matter, complete word indexes, geographical and alphabetical lists of all localities, a list of phonetic symbols, and the sentences in transcription for each BOOK...",0,1

"Modal and nonmodal phonation are contrasted from the perspective of voice production. It is shown that vocal fold vibrations from both types of phonation may be formed from just a few basic building blocks, called eigenmodes. Significantly, modal and nonmodal phonation may be distinguished based on the entrainment (i.e., synchronization) of the eigenmodes, where modal phonation corresponds to a 1:1 entrainment, and nonmodal corresponds to all more complex patterns. Indirect and direct investigations of eigenmode entrainment are reviewed, citing investigations from computer models, excised larynx experiments, and in vivo investigations on human subjects. Resonance studies of the vocal folds provide an indirect investigation of eigenmode entrainment, indicating which eigenmodes are most likely to entrain based on their natural frequencies. Challenging previous interpretations of the vocal fold resonance structure derived from the two-mass model, continuum models andin vivo studies on human subjects are beginning to converge on a similar description of the composite resonance. In addition, finite element models and highspeed imaging studies of the medial surface of the vocal folds provide powerful, direct evidence of eigenmode entrainment in vocal fold vibration. Applications of these techniques are suggested for exploring specific entrainment mechanisms used in language.",0,1
"Abstract In this paper, I propose that replication failure in linguistics may be due primarily to inherent issues with the application of experimental methods to analyze an inextricably social phenomenon like language, as opposed to poor research practices. Because language use varies across social contexts, and because social context must vary across independent experimental replications, linguists should not be surprised when experimental results fail to replicate at the expected rate. To address issues with replication failure in linguistics, and to increase methodological rigor in our field more generally, I argue that linguists must use experimental methods carefully, keeping in mind their inherent limitations, while acknowledging the scientific value of observational methods, which are often the only way to pursue basic questions in our field.",0,1
"Since Aristotle first set out rules of natural priority, rhetoricians and linguists have sought to establish the ‘natural order’ of words, phrases, and clauses. Accounts of constituent order by classical rhetoricians and philologists and by modern linguists and psychologists have addressed word order within phrases and phrasal order within clauses. However, they have not tended to investigate clausal order within sentences, with the important but limited exception of narration sequences (They had a baby and they got married), which—as recognized from Dionysius (‘What is prior in time should also be prior in word order’) to Grice (‘Be orderly’)—exhibit a robust but defeasible iconic link between order of events and order of mention. For clauses exhibiting the rhetorical relation of contrast rather than narration, the literature is less perspicuous. It is on such cases that I focus here, inspired by behaghel’s second law (1932:4): ‘That which is less important (or already known to the listener) is placed before that which is more important (or unknown) … Old concepts are placed before new’.",0,1

"This paper applies the lens of child language brokering to explore parent–child everyday interaction as an Afghan migrant family re‐grounds itself in the new linguistic and social context of Denmark. Whereas brokering is often seen as children's translating, this ethnographic study shows that children contribute with explaining , rather than only translating. Drawing on linguistic ethnographic data analysis, the study presents that these explaining activities are occasions for children and their parents to re/define their own role relations and for parents to display family ideologies about the quality of family relations to self and others, conveying that this family is thriving.",0,1
"This study explores lawyers’ linguistic traces of metapragmatic awareness as manifested in the opening speech of Anglo-American criminal trials, with a view to investigating the forms, functions, and distribution of explicit metapragmatics. Based on transcript data from five criminal trials, six groups of metapragmatic expressions are identified: verbal act descriptions, epistemic and evidential adjusters, message glosses, speech commentaries, talk about interactional norms, and talk about language use. Quantitative results indicate a unique distribution pattern, attributable to the discursive constraints associated with institutional norms and, to a lesser extent, to the presenter’s immediate communicative needs. The study reveals that while evidence and facts are the primary objects of dispute in the courtroom, pragmatic issues also often become objects of talk and, at times, are subject to being challenged. These metapragmatic utterances serve to enhance the lawyers’ propositional content and boost their credibility in various ways and can conceal the argumentative force of a lawyer’s statements, thereby mediating the interpretation of the facts and the import of evidence.",0,1
"Little is known about local, vernacular language ideologies about sign language development in deaf and hearing children in diverse communicative ecologies from the perspectives of caregivers. In this article, I argue for the interpretative value of repeated long-term linguistic ethnography for investigating language ideologies as they relate to language practices in different communicative situations. I present a case study of a family with a deaf caregiver, Regina, and two children, Angelica and Martha, who have invented their own communication system known as ""making hands"" in rural Oaxaca, Mexico. Using the linguistic ethnography approach, I analyze how the caregiver holds different language ideologies toward children's signing competence based on their age and audiological status, and how they shift over time. I also make explicit my positionality as a researcher for its role in shaping the research process of investigating language ideologies.",0,1

"Abstract This paper surveys the prominence hierarchy, a term which we use to refer to a ranking of person and other categories of reference for a variety of grammatical purposes. This kind of hierarchy has been referred to in the literature by various names, for example person hierarchy, empathy hierarchy, animacy hierarchy, indexability hierarchy, and so on. We exemplify the set of morphosyntactic phenomena accounted for by such hierarchies, and consider assumptions about how hierarchies are structured and how they work. We also discuss suggested motivations for the existence of the hierarchy, consider whether a universal statement of the prominence hierarchy can be made, and examine whether prominence hierarchies can be considered to be a typological universal. Finally, we discuss two examples of formal approaches to data described by prominence hierarchies.",0,1

"The present study investigates whether quantifier scope is computed incrementally during online sentence processing. We exploited the free word order in German to manipulate whether the verbal predicate preceded or followed the second quantifier in doubly quantified sentences that required the computation of inverse scope. A possessive pronoun in the first quantifier that had to be bound by the second quantifier was used to enforce scope inversion. We tested whether scope inversion causes difficulty and whether this difficulty emerges even at a point before comprehenders have encountered the main verb. We report three pretests and two reading time experiments. The first two pretests were offline tests that established (1) that the sentences exhibited the assumed scope preferences and (2) that variable binding forced scope inversion. The third pretest employed self-paced reading to show that interpreting a bound variable is not difficult per se and that difficulty in the critical construction must thus be due to inverting scope. Incremental processing of quantifier scope was investigated in a self-paced reading experiment. We observed difficulty right after the second quantifier, but only if it appeared after the main verb, that is, after the predication was complete. Further evidence for late scope inversion comes from an eyetracking experiment. Again, a scope inversion effect could only be observed at the end of the sentence. Taken together, our study demonstrates that in German inverse scope is only computed at the sentence boundary.",0,1
"Particle stacking, a phenomenon that sees more than one sentence-final particle used to mark an utterance, occurs in various languages, including Singlish, also commonly known as Colloquial Singapore English (CSE) or Singapore Colloquial English (SCE). In this paper, we provide novel empirical data on particle stacking in Singlish using the National Speech Corpus (NSC). A frequency analysis of particle stacks containing the Singlish particles hor, lah and meh in the NSC shows that most of the particle stacks are declarative-interrogative pairs where the first particle is used in assertions while the second particle has a backchannelling function, which is consistent with particles stacks observed in other languages. We also identify two particle stacks in Singlish – lah dey and lah sia – where the second particle does not overtly solicit the addressee’s response. We propose that dey and sia, together with the backchannelling particles, form a larger class of addressee-oriented particles based on their shared function of targeting the addressee’s attention.",0,1
"Most languages in the world distinguish various content interrogatives, like English who, what, where, when, which, how, and why. However, Givón (1990; 2001) has claimed that in Pichis Ashéninca, an Arawakan language from Peru, there is only one content interrogative, tsica, that covers all possible interrogative meanings. In this article, I argue against this analysis. Based on a corpus of questions in Pichis Ashéninca, extracted from texts, I argue that most content questions do indeed use the word tsica, but the interrogative meaning is further specified by the construction in which it is used. When the different interrogative constructions are properly distinguished, Pichis Ashéninca distinguishes almost all interrogative categories expected from a European perspective. Still, the structure of these interrogative constructions in Pichis Ashéninca is special from a typological viewpoint because of these characteristics: (1) there is no distinction between ‘who’ and ‘what’; (2) all content interrogative constructions are transparently built on the basis of just one root; (3) this basic interrogative root in isolation has the meaning ‘where’; and (4) the noninterrogative parts of the interrogative constructions are verbs. Based on a worldwide investigation of content interrogatives, I argue that these four characteristics are rare. However, all these characteristics are relatively widespread in South America, making it less of a surprise that there is a language in this part of the world that combines all of these unusual characteristics.",0,1
"Meet the English Profile Wordlists:describing what learners Can Do Melissa Good (bio) This is not a typographical error. The capitalization of ""Can Do"" that you see in the headline above is meant to be printed that way. Buy why? And what is English Profile? English Profile is a long-term program of research, publishing and corpus development, and the English Profile Wordlists are the first main outcome from that program. It is a collaboration among Cambridge University Press, the exam board Cambridge ESOL, and a number of other academic departments, government bodies and educationists in Europe, the Americas and Asia. Founded in 2006 in Cambridge, UK, but global in outlook, English Profile's mission is to describe in detail what vocabulary, grammar and functional language1 learners of English ""Can Do"" as they progress up a well-established set of six levels of language proficiency: the Common European Framework for Reference in Languages (CEFR2). Despite the word 'European', the CEFR is being used more and more around the world to measure students' ability in both English and other languages. However, because the CEFR is language neutral, and because some of its specifications for English are either vague or fairly subjective, English Profile researchers are using empirical evidence to underpin these levels for English, thereby creating a more detailed worldwide standard for proficiency. The English Profile Wordlists, which describe the vocabulary that [End Page 113-] students ""Can Do"" at each level, could be a useful tool for those who create English dictionaries for non-native speakers. For those not familiar with the CEFR, it has three main levels, A for Basic User, B for Independent User and C for Proficient User, with two sub-divisions for each one (A1, A2, etc). This simple framework is detailed in hundreds of ""Can Do"" statements (remember the headline above?), which aim to show what a learner ""Can Do"" rather than what he or she must do to achieve mastery of a particular level. Two examples are shown in Table 1. Click for larger view View full resolution Table 1. As you can see, these ""Can Do"" statements relate to a learner's writing skills at two different levels, A2 and B1. The words in italics are those that are particularly subjective and open to interpretation. What words or phrases are used in a short, simple note or message? What vocabulary might be contained in a short, basic description of an event or activity? This is what the English Profile Wordlists team3 aims to address. To do this, they are using a variety of sources, most importantly corpus data. So far, the primary corpus for English Profile researchers has been the Cambridge Learner Corpus, another Cambridge University Press-Cambridge ESOL collaboration which includes to date more than 45 million words from texts produced by learners around the world who are taking Cambridge exams. However, because the data in the Cambridge Learner Corpus is based on exam material, its scope is a bit limited. An exam is an artificial environment in which students write or speak about a particular pre-determined subject, and thus is not likely to yield the most natural writing or speech. English Profile researchers could gain even more valuable insights from a corpus that is based on other learner material, such as classroom [End Page 114] work, homework, classroom discussions, casual conversations, and so on. Therefore, the English Profile corpus team is working on collecting data from schools, universities and individual teachers in (at last count) sixteen different countries around the world4. The team hopes to expand that network even more over the next several years, and are aiming for a corpus of 10 million words of learner writing and speech, balanced in terms of first language and CEFR level, within the next two to three years. The vocabulary, grammar and functional language that English Profile researchers are examining will be captured in a set of Reference Level Descriptions (RLDs) for English5, which will be made available to the public between 2011 and 2013. The first component of the RLDs for English is the English Profile Wordlists. Similar in format to an online dictionary, the Wordlists provide...",0,1

"Lie-telling is a false verbal statement made with the intention to deceive another. Lies may be told for selfish reasons or due to prosocial motivations. As a result, the veracity of a statement holds more than just communicative intent but rather represents social intentions. In the current experiment children (6- to 12-years old) viewed 12 vignettes which depicted a protagonist either telling a truth or a lie. The protagonist’s statements either hurt another or themselves (other versus self). Following viewing of each vignette participants provided a moral evaluation of the protagonist’s statement (five-point Likert) and a classification of the statements; as either a truth or lie. Additionally, a novel method of evaluating statements was introduced, whereby children evaluated communicative intent as an act, to be rewarded or punished. Results revealed that both lies and truths were accurately identified, with the exception of altruistic lies (benefits to another) and tattling truths (harms another). Younger children rewarded truthful statements, which harmed or hurt another, significantly more often than older children. Older children ranked lies to help another significantly more favorably than lies to protect the self. Children also rewarded confessions and punished antisocial lies most frequently. Results highlight the notable differences in children’s perceptions of varying forms of honesty and lying.",0,1
"Reviewed by: Koineization in Medieval Spanish by Donald N. Tuten Peter Trudgill Koineization in Medieval Spanish. By Donald N. Tuten. Berlin: Mouton de Gruyter, 2003. Pp. ix, 345. ISBN 3110177447. $96.33 (Hb). The dialect situations in the Iberian Peninsula and anglophone North America have a number of similarities. In the varieties of English spoken along the east coast of Canada and the United States, from Newfoundland and the Maritimes down to Georgia, we find a dialect continuum with considerable regional variation and relatively small dialect areas. As one travels west, however, regional dialect differences increasingly diminish so that by the time the west coast is reached, there is relatively little regional dialect variation and larger dialect areas. Similarly, along the northern edge of Iberia, from the Atlantic via the southern edge of the Pyrenees to the Mediterranean, there is also a dialect continuum with considerable linguistic variation and small dialect areas. Traveling from west to east, one encounters the Ibero-Romance varieties Galician, Asturian, Castilian, Aragonese, and Catalan. The degree of regional variation is much greater than in eastern North America, to the extent that Galician, Castilian, and Catalan are considered distinct languages, and Asturian and Aragonese also have claims to separate language status (Trudgill 2004a). The resemblance with North America, however, lies in the fact that as one travels south toward the southern coastal areas of Andalusia and Murcia, the degree of dialectal differentiation diminishes and dialect areas become bigger. These parallels are not a coincidence. Both the east coast of North America and the north coast of Iberia have been settled by speakers (of English and Ibero-Romance respectively) for longer than the areas with less variation. And, crucially, it was expansion out of these longer-settled areas (westward and southward respectively) which led to the dialect mixture and thus the leveling out of regional differences. The North American dialect mixture occurred as settlers from different parts of the east coast gradually moved westward, following the frontier of colonization. And the Iberian mixture occurred, several hundred years earlier, as a result of the reconquest of the peninsula by Ibero-Romance-speaking Christians from the Arabic and Berber-speaking Moslem Moors, a process which lasted from the ninth to the fifteenth century. As Penny (1991, 2000) was the first to point out, the southward Iberian expansion and the dialect mixture that went with it account for a number of historical developments in the history of Spanish, and therefore for a number of the characteristics of the modern language. According to Penny’s thesis, there were three major phases in the development of Spanish during which dialect mixture led to koineization, and then rekoineization of already koineized varieties. As Tuten describes it, the first phase lasted from the ninth to the eleventh century and focused on the city of Burgos in north central Spain, where Ibero-Romance speakers from all over northern Spain—but especially northern Castile, Asturias, Navarre, and Leon—came together as part of the southward expansion. Basque speakers were also involved, so there was some language contact as well as dialect contact. The second phase of koineization took place between the eleventh and thirteenth centuries and focused on the central city of Toledo. Here again dialect mixture occurred on a large scale, and there was also a limited amount of (related) language contact as French and Occitan speakers joined the fight against the Moors. Finally, the third phase, which took place between the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, focused on the southwestern city of Seville. Once again, considerable dialect mixture occurred as populations speaking different dialects moved in from the north to replace the Moors. What T has done in this important book is to take Penny’s thesis and flesh it out with a detailed study of a number of linguistic features, both phonological and grammatical, and a detailed reconstruction of their development. The book is of such general interest that it is a pity that the many and lengthy quotes from Spanish authors have not been translated into English with, perhaps, the originals in an appendix. This oversight is likely to cause problems for, say, Japanese experts on dialect contact or Polish students of historical...",0,1
"Gary H. Toops In Memoriam Stephen M. Dickey Gary H. Toops passed away this fall, on 14 October 2013. He was born on 30 March 1954 in Fort Eustis, Virginia. He graduated from McGill University in Montreal and earned his PhD in Slavic languages and literatures from Yale University in 1985. From 1989 he taught at Wichita State University, where he was Professor of Russian and Linguistics. He was the backbone of Wichita State University’s Russian program, teaching courses in Russian language, literature, and linguistics, as well as German, French, and general and Romance linguistics. Professor Toops was also an accomplished Slavic linguist, and he published research articles steadily throughout his career, mostly on Slavic verbal categories. His dissertation is entitled Grammatical Causality in Slavic and remains, as far as I am aware, the only investigation of causal constructions with a cross-Slavic emphasis. Causality and causal auxiliaries in the Slavic languages continued to be a subject of his published articles until his death. His later articles on the subject focused on West Slavic, and his last published article (Toops 2013) presents a detailed comparative analysis of types of causative constructions in Upper Sorbian and Czech. Professor Toops was also one of the world’s leading experts on the Upper Sorbian language, and as time went on most of his research on causality and verbal aspect focused on Upper Sorbian, either exclusively or comparatively. He knew German fluently, which is a necessity for analyses of the grammatical categories of Upper Sorbian (and West Slavic more generally), and much of his later research tackled the issue of German linguistic interference in Upper Sorbian and Czech (see, e.g., Toops 1992a, 1992b, 1999, 2006, 2013). He took a nuanced approach to such German interference, concluding that in some cases German interference could facilitate a change in Upper Sorbian or Czech that then took a path largely determined by the structure of the replicating language itself. His rejection of an either–or approach to German linguistic interference in West Slavic is eminently realistic. [End Page 7] Toops 2006 is also notable for surveying cases of possible German linguistic interference in Upper Sorbian and ranking them according to degrees of likelihood. This article makes an important contribution to the ongoing assessment of the role of German linguistic influence in western Slavic languages (cf. in this regard similar efforts by Berger [2008] and Reindl [2005]). One case of German interference in Upper Sorbian aspectual prefixation has, as far as I am aware, been placed in the wider context of the contact-induced breakdown of the Upper Sorbian aspectual system solely in the analysis presented by Toops (1992a). This is the loss of derived imperfectives paired with prefixed perfective verbs of motion and their replacement by constructions of the simplex imperfective plus adverb. For example, perfective wuńć ‘go out’ is no longer paired with the derived imperfective †wuchadŸeć ‘idem’, but with the imperfective simplex won hić ‘out go’. Toops (1992a: 13) points out that the replacement of derived imperfectives has only occurred in the directly spatial meaning of the prefixed verbs of motion, and that in figurative meanings the derived imperfective verbs are still employed (e.g., Nowiny wuchadŸeja tydŸensce ‘The newspaper comes out weekly’). The significance of this development for theories of aspect and aspectual prefixation has not yet been recognized. Note that Toops (2001) also treats similar phenomena in Latvian. It is possible that such “paraphrastic imperfectives” are characteristic of proto-aspectual systems or aspectual systems otherwise characterized by a low degree of grammaticalization. This phenomenon deserves more attention, as it is very relevant for the synchronic and diachronic analysis of Slavic verbal aspect (and, again, the issue of German interference). It is sad that Professor Toops is no longer with us to contribute to the study of this phenomenon. In general, Professor Toops’s work on causatives and verbal aspect is marked by meticulous attention to sometimes subtle discourse factors and never slips into convenient, reductivist arguments. This is one reason why his articles will not lose their relevance for the study of the Slavic verb in the foreseeable future. It should be noted that Professor Toops translated Heinz...",0,1
"Chemotherapeutic insensitivity is a main obstacle for effective treatment of gastric cancer (GC), the underlying mechanism remains to be investigated. Metastasis-associated in colon cancer-1 (MACC1), a transcription factor highly expressed in GC, is found to be related to chemotherapy sensitivity. Monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1), a plasma membrane protein co-transporting lactate and H+, mediates drug sensitivity by regulating lactate metabolism. Targeting MCT1 has recently been regarded as a promising way to treat cancers and MCT1 inhibitor has entered the clinical trial for GC treatment. However, the correlation of these two genes and their combined effects on chemotherapy sensitivity has not been clarified. In this study, we found that MACC1 and MCT1 were both highly expressed in GC and exhibited a positive correlation in clinical samples. Further, we demonstrated that MACC1 could mediate sensitivity of 5-FU and cisplatin in GC cells, and MACC1 mediated MCT1 regulation was closely related to this sensitivity. A MCT1 inhibitor AZD3965 recovered the sensitivity of 5-FU and cisplatin in GC cells which overexpressed MACC1. These results suggested that MACC1 could influence the chemotherapy sensitivity by regulating MCT1 expression, providing new ideas and strategy for GC treatment.",0,1
"Abstract As a field, sociocultural linguistics has a long legacy of public scholarship that has worked to counter linguistic prejudices and inequalities perpetuated through language. Today, current community engagement within sociocultural linguistics increasingly takes a collaborative approach that includes students. In this article, I therefore explore how the field prepares both students and faculty for this work. In particular, I focus on courses with a service learning component, suggesting that these constitute key spaces for developing the commitments and capacities necessary for engaged work that advances sociolinguistic justice. I highlight the insights of existing scholarship on service learning in linguistics before turning to a more detailed discussion of pedagogical practice, drawing on current critical pedagogy literature that emphasize the importance of language and culture. Synthesizing two social movement perspectives, I propose a pedagogical framework that supports faculty and students in learning to accompany as an accomplice. I demonstrate the application of this model by discussing specific pedagogical strategies enacted in a community engaged course I taught on Language and Migration at a university in the United States. Ultimately, I suggest that developing social justice pedagogies is a crucial endeavor if we are to counter the ways that language has been used to justify inequalities and motivate violence towards racialized communities, both in the past and in the present.",0,1
"The aim of this paper is to examine the quantity and quality of the information provided on affixes in the 1995 editions of OALD, LDOCE, COBUILD and CIDE. The comparative analysis is based on the entries for two prefixes, dis- and pro-, and two suffixes, -ish and -or, which are evaluated against the following ten required entry components: Spelling, Pronunciation, Input/Output units, Sense distinctions, Definitions, Cross-references, Usage labels, Productivity, Examples and Terminology. The analysis shows that all four dictionaries paint only part of the expected picture, and that there is ample room for improvement in the realization of most components, for which a number of suggestions are made. Also discussed in some depth are (1) essential differences between affixes and other lexical units, (2) various approaches to the delimitation of affixes, and (3) the factors determining the establishment of a criterial set of affixal properties.",0,1
"Abstract ‘Pragmaticist’ positions posit a three‐way division within utterance content between: (i) the standing meaning of the sentence, (ii) a somewhat pragmatically enhanced meaning which captures what the speaker explicitly conveys (following Sperber and Wilson, I label this the ‘explicature’), and (iii) further indirectly conveyed propositions which the speaker merely implies. Here I re‐examine the notion of an explicature, asking how it is defined and what work explicatures are supposed to do. I argue that explicatures get defined in three different ways and that these distinct definitions can and do pull apart. Thus the notion of an explicature turns out to be ill‐defined.",0,1
"Financier, philanthropist and economist George Soros is not the first to have used or derived the notion of reflexivity (for example, Anthony Giddens, Ulrich Beck and others have found it useful in their work). What is different about the approach of Soros is that he has used the concept of reflexivity to explain the workings of global markets, and for this reason his work seems to me to have particular potential for explaining language trends in the linguistic policies and practices of global marketers. Soros has challenged ruling economic orthodoxy by arguing that demand and supply are not given or objective, and far from determining how markets develop. Participants in economic processes inevitably and unavoidably shape and determine the outcome of those economic processes and also create the conditions for future development of those market processes. This particular insight, I would argue, could help us to understand and develop further the notion of normativity in‘global’linguistic practices and policies, particularly when linked to economic processes since “the self-validating capacity [of such processes] encourages trend-following speculation” (Soros 1994). We can equate the decisions of many global marketers to that of stock brokers, who largely act on their intuitions (linguistic intuitions), but who in turn create conditions for those intuitions to be successful now and in the future, in effect by creating language trends.",0,1

"The Middle English Compendium: Past, Present, Future Frances McSparran ""Indexes and dictionaries .. are the compendium of all knowledge"" Ti me Middle English period spans roughly the years 1150-1500 and presents a complex social and linguistic culture. The English used during this period varied according to region , and the language changed in pronunciation, grammar, vocabulary , and spelling habits over these three to four hundred years. Middle English was thus not uniform and static but formed a continuum of different dialects, shifting and changing over both space and time, and influenced in various ways, particularly in its lexis, by contact with the other languages used within the country.2 The written varieties of Middle English are preserved in a huge body of literary texts and documents of all kinds, and the print MiddleEnglish Dictionary (MED), completed in 2001 under the editorship of Robert E. Lewis, and based on about three million quotations drawn from this mass of texts and records, offers a rich and reliable record of the lexis and usage of this 'The quotation, dated 1714, is taken from OED2 (1989), s.v. compendium, sense 2(b). 2Alongside Middle English in all its various dialects and registers, Latin was used extensively as the language for administration, religion and learning, Anglo-Norman and other French dialects were the languages of social prestige and of literature for much of the period, and Welsh spilled over the borders into the western part of the country; these intermingled language contacts influenced English, especially in the area of lexis.

In 1996, as the print MED neared completion, a small committee was appointed by the Office of the Vice-President for Research (OVPR) in the University of Michigan to consider the merits of creating an electronic version of the dictionary. As we discussed forms of delivery and access, we were eager to find ways to make the rich resources of the MED most accessible to the varying needs of students and scholars, and, with that in mind, I proposed that we make an electronic MED the central component in a cluster of interconnected electronic resources and designed a model showing how this should work. The main components , which we would produce locally, would be an electronic version of the MED, a HyperBibliography of Middle English texts, based on the bibliographies created in the production of the print MED, but updated and expanded, and a Corpus of Middle English Prose and Verse, the nucleus of which had already been developed by the Humanities Text Initiative (HTI) witiiin the University of Michigan Library. These core components would be closely linked to one another, and I further proposed the gradual addition of links between them and related but independent electronic projects being developed elsewhere. Discussions with John Price-Wilkin, head of Digital Library Production Service (DLPS) within the University of Michigan Library and our committee's technological expert, established that die implementation of diis design and its distribution on the Internet were practical possibilities. This project was to become the Middle English Compendium (MEC). With the backing of OVPR,John Price-Wilkin and I jointly prepared a grant proposal for developing these three core resources and submitted it to the National Endowment for the Humanities. A generous two-year grant from NEH in 1997 and significant additional support from OVPR and the University of Michigan Library funded the project, and full-time work began in the fall of 1997. Two new staff membersjoined the project; one of these, Paul Schaffner, a medievalist and former MED research editor, managed the conversion of the print MED into SGML markup, while other essential technological support and programming were provided by Digital Library Production Service.3 John Price-Wilkin provided overall guidance for production , while I have had overall editorial responsibility.

"This paper presents an unsupervised method for developing a character-based n-gram classifier that identifies loanwords or transliterated foreign words in Korean text. The classifier is trained on an unlabeled corpus using the Expectation Maximization algorithm, building on seed words extracted from the corpus. Words with high token frequency serve as native seed words. Words with seeming traces of vowel insertion to repair consonant clusters serve as foreign seed words. What counts as a trace of insertion is determined using phoneme co-occurrence statistics in conjunction with ideas and findings in phonology. Experiments show that the method can produce an unsupervised classifier that performs at a level comparable to that of a supervised classifier. In a cross-validation experiment using a corpus of about 9.2 million words and a lexicon of about 71,000 words, mean F-scores of the best unsupervised classifier and the corresponding supervised classifier were 94.77 and 96.67 %, respectively. Experiments also suggest that the method can be readily applied to other languages with similar phonotactics such as Japanese.",0,1

"Abstract The reading acceleration phenomenon refers to the effect that experimentally induced time constraints can generate instantaneous improvements of reading rate, accuracy and comprehension among typical and reading impaired readers of different age groups. An overview of studies applying the fading manipulation (i.e., letters are erased in reading direction), which induces the time constraints causing the acceleration phenomenon, is provided in the first part of this review. The second part summarises the outcomes of studies using a training approach called the reading acceleration program (RAP) that integrated core principles of the acceleration phenomenon to generate persistent reading performance improvements. Our review shows ample evidence for the validity of the acceleration phenomenon, since it has been replicated across various languages and populations. However, although there are several explanatory approaches for underlying mechanisms, none of them is well substantiated by empirical evidence so far. Similarly, although generally positive effects of RAP training were reported for several languages and groups of readers, the exact mechanisms causing improved reading rates and comprehension are not well understood. Our critical discussion points out several limitations of RAP that call for further research. However, we also highlight several benefits regarding RAP's potential as an intervention approach for enhancements in reading performance. Video abstract link: https://youtu.be/wO6aEXavk8w",0,1

"Measuring Events Guido Vanden Wyngaerd The telic-atelic distinction has been argued to hinge on the presence of a (bounded) internal argument measuring out the event, or, alternatively, a resultative small clause providing an end point for the event. Both perspectives are partially correct and partially incorrect. On the one hand, the resultative is more adequately seen as a measure than an end point; on the other, it is the resultative predicate rather than the internal argument that performs this measuring function. Empirical evidence is adduced in support of this point of view: resultative predicates are subject to the requirement that they denote a bounded scale. Only bounded predicates can delimit an event by providing it with minimal parts. As a matter of conceptual necessity, unbounded predicates, though potentially denoting end points, cannot function as event measures.* Introduction The distinction between telic and atelic (bounded and unbounded, or delimited and nondelimited) events has a long and venerable tradition, both in the philosophical and the linguistic literature (Kenny 1963, Ryle 1949, Garey 1957, Potts 1965, Vendler 1967, Bauer 1970, Verkuyl 1972, Comrie 1976, Nordenfelt 1977, Declerck 1979, Dowty 1979, Bach 1981, Dahl 1981, Bennett 1981, Mourelatos 1981, Brinton 1988, Hoekstra 1988, Talmy 1988, Binnick 1991, Smith 1991, Tenny 1994, Depraetere 1995, Jackendoff 1996, to name just a few). For example, in the aspectual classification developed by Vendler (1967) and Dowty (1979), given in 1, the states and activities may be taken as unbounded, the accomplishments and achievements as bounded. 1. states know, believe, have, desire, love activities run, walk, swim, push a cart, drive a car, tease Mary accomplishments paint a picture, make a chair, deliver a sermon, draw a circle, run across the street achievements recognize, spot, find, lose, reach, die As the examples make clear, and as Verkuyl has pointed out (1972), the aspectual classification requires that one look not just at verbs, but at least at VPs. 2. a. Mark knitted a sweater. b. Mark knitted sweaters. Thus 2a is telic or bounded, that is it has an inherent end point, whereas 2b, with a bare plural object, is unbounded. In other words, depending on what the VP contains, the interpretation of any particular verb may shift from unbounded to bounded, or vice versa. Resultatives also illustrate this phenomenon. Thus Hoekstra (1988, 1992) has argued that any activity verb may be turned into an accomplishment by adding a resultative small clause to it, as in 3. 3. a. Freddy cried. b. Freddy cried the handkerchief wet. Used intransitively (3a), the activity of crying has no inherent end point. But in 3b, [End Page 61] the interpretation is different in that the activity is inherently bounded. According to Hoekstra, the combination of the postverbal NP and secondary predicate expresses a state that constitutes the end point of the crying activity. Syntactically, the combination the handkerchief wet is argued to form a constituent, viz. a (resultative) small clause. A different perspective on accomplishments is presented by Tenny (1994). Consider 4. 4. Sam mowed the lawn. The direct object is said to ‘measure out’ the activity of the verb: as the activity progresses, more parts of the lawn are mowed, until there is no lawn left to be mowed, at which point the activity must terminate. The lawn may consequently be seen as a scale or measurer of the amount of activity that has taken place. Thus, whereas Hoekstra considers the postverbal constituent in accomplishments to represent an end point, in Tenny’s view it is an event measurer. While there is no inherent incompatibility between these points of view, I shall present evidence suggesting that it is possible to construe an empirical difference between them. The evidence will show that in terms of measuring out Tenny’s view is empirically more accurate with respect to the role played by the postverbal constituent in accomplishments. This implies that Hoekstra’s view on telic sentences as involving a small clause that denotes an end point is incorrect. But I shall argue that Hoekstra is correct with respect to the essential role played by the secondary predicate itself in the aspectual interpretation of the event. Tenny’s analysis is therefore wrong in...",0,1
"ResumenEn este trabajo se estudian las expresiones de edad con ser yestar en el español guatemalteco y el mexicano. Se analizan los factores lingüísticos y extralingüísticos que favorecen la extensión de estar y el proceso de cambio lingüístico en el contexto de la expresión de edad en ambas modalidades dialectales. Sobre la base del análisis de tres corpus sociolingüísticos pertenecientes a estas comunidades (uno de Ciudad de México y dos de Guatemala), los resultados muestran, por una parte, que estar es la cópulapredominante y, por la otra, que ciertos adjetivos de edad favorecen la extensión de esta cópula: chico, chiquito, grande. Nuestras conclusiones proponen que la expresión de la edad con los verbos copulativos ser y estar es un rasgo de diferenciación dialectal y constituye, a la vez, una etapa en la evolución deestar a expensas de ser.Palabras clave: sociolingüística – adjetivos de edad – cambio lingüístico – dialectología hispánica AbstractThis paper focuses on expressions of age combined with the verbs ser and estar in the Spanish of Guatemala and Mexico. It analyses the linguistic and extralinguistic factors favoring the extension of estar and the process of linguistic change involved in the expression of age in the two dialectal groups. Based on the analysis of three linguistic corpora from these communities (one from Ciudad de México and two from Guatemala), the results show, on the one hand, that estar is the most frequent copulative form, and, on the other, that some age-related adjectives favor the extension of the copulative form: chico, chiquito, grande. The paper concludes that age expressions with ser and estar are a feature of dialectal differentiation and, at the same time, an evolution ofestar at the expense of ser.Keywords: sociolinguistics – age adjectives – linguistic change – Hispanic dialectology",0,1
"Dependency distance (DD) is a well-established measure of syntactic complexity. Previous studies largely focused on the linear dimension, mostly by mean of dependency distance (MDD). In the present study, a new quantitative indicator –mean hierarchical dependency distance (MHDD), is proposed to discuss DD-related issues. Combining MHDD and MDD, the study investigates syntactic complexity of different texts, using strictly length-controlled sentences of 12 text types from the Freiburg-Brown corpus of American English. Correlations of MHDD and MDD have been identified, and possible reasons are discussed from the mathematical and theoretical perspectives. Mathematically, one is that the numerator of MHDD overlaps with the denominator of MDD, both being (n-1) where n is the number of words in the sentence. The other is that the denominator of MHDD (maximum hierarchical layer: MAXHL) and the numerator of MDD (sum of DD: SOD), are positively correlated. We believe that it is the positive correlation of SOD and MAXHL that ensures the change of MDD and MHDD in the same direction. It is also worth noting that both MAXHL and SOD seem to be minimized at their respective data spectrum, which foreshadows the dependency distance minimization (DDM) tendency on the hierarchical dimension.",0,1
"Recent comparative semantics suggests that sign language makes use of the same logical resources as spoken language, but has richer mechanisms of iconic enrichment. It is often thought that when speech is analyzed in tandem with iconic gestures, ‘expressive parity’ is regained between speech and sign. But this comparison between sign-with-iconicity and speech-with-gestures turns out to be complex because iconic enrichments often have a non-at-issue status, as attested by their interaction with logical operators. We argue that the status of iconic enrichments is constrained by two parameters: ±internal, ±separate_time_slot. If an enrichment is effected by the internal modification of an expression (+internal)—e.g. by lengthening the word loooong in English, or the sign GROW in ASL—it can have any semantic status and can in particular be at-issue. If an enrichment is an external addition to an expression (-internal)—as is the case of co-speech gestures in English—it does not make an at-issue contribution, but it may have the status of a presupposition or of a supplement. If an enrichment has a separate time slot (+separate_time_slot), it may not be trivial (= presupposed), and must thus be at-issue or supplemental. The generalization is assessed on the basis of vocal iconicity in spoken language, iconic modulations in sign language, co-speech/co-sign as well as post-speech/post-sign gestures and facial expressions in spoken and sign language, and also gestures that fully replace words in spoken language. Our typology suggests that there are systematic expressive differences between sign-with-iconicity and speech-with-gestures, and also that the semantic status of iconic enrichments can in part be predicted by parameters pertaining to their form.",0,1

"This article investigates the structural assembly and semantics of innovative quotatives such as be like, be all and go in English. While the sociolinguistic origins and spread of these forms have received ample attention, a question that is rarely addressed is how precisely this construction is syntagmatically composed, and how it relates to more canonical forms of speech representation. We argue that the basic component structures are the be like or go clause as a whole (I'm like, he went, etc.) and the reported complement. It is the entire reporting clause, rather than the reporting verb as is traditionally assumed, which is complemented by the quoted material. The proposed interclausal dependence analysis, which applies to English direct speech constructions generally, can accommodate grammatically intransitive as well as semantically nonreportative verbs such as be and go. As well, it helps motivate the emergence of be like and go quotatives by a fundamental semantic correspondence between these, broadly speaking, ‘imitation’ clauses and reporting clauses.",0,1

Each of these areas of Hup grammar and its typological significance are best understood within an approach that weaves explanation together with description, and in the process takes a view of language as a dynamic, non-autonomous system, which cannot be abstracted away from its own past or the culture and environment of its speakers.",0,1

"This study claims that, in contrast with previous proposals in the literature, essentially all instances of stop epenthesis in two consonant clusters (e.g., [ml] > [mbl], [ls] > [lts], [wl] > [wgl]) may be attributed to the articulatory requirements and aerodynamic constraints involved in the production of the original cluster. The inserted stop results from the perceptual categorization of a transitional closure event. Several mechanisms may give rise to this momentary stoppage of air, and to an intraoral pressure rise which causes the stop burst to become prominent enough so that the emergent stop can be successfully perceived. Apparently exceptional cases such as [nl] > [ngl] and [sl] > [skl] are accounted for through direct epenthesis assuming that [l] is strongly dark and thus, produced with a back postdorsal constriction. Data on stop deletion in consonant clusters appear to be in support of this production-based explanation of stop insertion.",0,1
"In this article, I explain how I use frame analysis in my research on immigrants’ rights claims in receiving society. My theoretical approach relies on two core aspects. First, I use a decolonial-intersectional epistemology to conceptualize my methodology and conduct my empirical research. This approach allows to bring into focus the analysis of ideology and power dynamics to understand how immigrants are constructed by different political actors and how immigrant activists respond. Second, I adopt an actor-oriented approach and combine ethnographic research with frame analysis to make sense of how pro-immigrant actors and immigrants themselves frame their approach to migration and the ways in which they translate their framing into specific strategies to integrate immigrants in society and promote their rights. As an example, I discuss how I have applied the theoretical approach to my research on immigrant activism in Italy. Beyond my work, this article emphasizes that a decolonial-intersectional approach can improve current research on frame analysis of rights claims of marginalized groups, by addressing how these groups expose and challenge structures of oppression in their own terms.",0,1

"Ukrainian Ø-suffixed deverbal nouns such as perépyt 'repeated inquiry' are derived from perfective and/or imperfective verbs (< perepytátyPFV 'to ask again, re-interrogate', perepýtuvatyIPFV 'to ask repeatedly'). In some nouns, a complete match in segments and prosody between a base and the derivative is found in the infinitival stem of either or both aspects, as in nadríz 'cut, incision', nadrízatyPFV, nadrízuvatyIPFV 'to make a slight cut'. For other nouns, a segmental match is found in the infinitival stem, but another verb form would be needed to provide the prosodic match, as in rozrýv 'rupture, break', rozryvátyIPFV, rozirvátyPFV 'to tear, rend, break apart', with a stress match only in rozrývanyjPPP. But for many nouns with stress on the prefix, as in perépyt, there simply is no derivational base available for a prosodic match. The proposal is that stress on the prefix in deverbal nouns is a morphosemantic innovation in Ukrainian motivated by hypostasis, i.e., the process of a noun becoming more concrete, designating a result or product of the action rather than nominalizing the action itself (Townsend 1980). The derivation of deverbal nouns can be seen as a stem-level process subject to a grammar with some version of Base-Derivative faithfulness (Stress Faith >> Stress Prefix). But in hypostatic masculine deverbal nouns, the prosodic adjustment takes place on words and here stress is (re)assigned to the prefix by Stress Prefix >> Stress Faith. Ukrainian thus presents a notable case of prosodically marked semantic change.",0,1

"An experiment is reported which investigates the impact of two variables on the likelihood of obtaining plural pronoun anaphors in a continuation task. The first variable is syntactic: the use of and versus with as a means of relating two singular characters. Use of and enhances the likelihood of obtaining a plural anaphor in continuations, but the incidence of plural is never as high as 60%. The second variable is description type: whether the characters are introduced through proper names (e. g. Harry), or through a simple definition noun phrase (e. g. the doctor). When two descriptions are of the same type, plural reference is enhanced, regardless of syntactic condition, and regardless of whether the two descriptions are names or noun phrases. This effect is traced in part to the special status afforded to characters which are introduced through proper names. A discussion is presented within the framework of an account of plural anaphora based on singular individuals mapping into common role-slots in background knowledge (scenario)",0,1
"Samenvatting: Zesendertig jaar na Afrikaanse etimologieë van Boshoff en Nienaber verscheener in 2003 een nieuw etymologisch woordenboek van het Afrikaans: het Etimologiewoordeboek vanAfrikaans (EWA). Tussen die twee woordenboeken bestaat een wezenlijk verschil. Het werk vanBoshoff en Nienaber is vrijwel alleen toegankelijk voor specialisten en niet specifiek bedoeld vooreen breed publiek. EWA is juist allereerst bestemd voor de leek die zich interesseert voor de oorsprongen de geschiedenis van de eigen taal. Daarnaast biedt het ook de etymoloog en historischtaalkundige een hoop gegevens en inspiratie voor nader onderzoek. Als etymologisch woordenboekbezit EWA een aantal bijzondere, eigen kenmerken. De selectie van de woorden is bepaalddoor het beoogde gebruikerspubliek. Als gevolg daarvan bevat EWA verscheidene typen woordendie in traditionele etymologische woordenboeken doorgaans veronachtzaamd worden, zoals afleidingen,samenstellingen, neologismen en gemeenzame spreektaalwoorden. De artikelstructuurwordt gekenmerkt door een hoge graad van uniformiteit en consistentie. Het accent ligt op dezogenaamde etymologia proxima, de etymologie waarbij men één stap teruggaat en de meestdirecte herkomst van het woord biedt. Voorts is speciale aandacht besteed aan polysemie: nietalleen de herkomst van de dominante betekenis van een woord wordt gegeven, maar ook die vanzijn eventuele andere betekenis(sen). Benoemingsmotieven komen ook veelvuldig aan bod. In eeneventuele tweede druk zouden opvallende verschillen in vorm of betekenis altijd verklaard of inieder geval besproken moeten worden. Dat blijft nu nogal eens achterwege. Ook zou voorafgaandaan zo'n volgende editie meer onderzoek naar woordhistorisch materiaal uit primaire bronnenvoor met name de 17de–19de eeuw verricht moeten worden. Het zou mooi zijn als deze eersteuitgave van EWA de aanleiding tot een dergelijk onderzoek zou vormen.Sleutelwoorden: BENOEMINGSMOTIEF, ETYMOLOGIA PROXIMA, ETYMOLOGIAREMOTA, ETYMOLOGIE, ETYMOLOGISCH WOORDENBOEK, LEXICOGRAFIE, LEENVERTALING,MACROSTRUCTUUR, MICROSTRUCTUUR, POLYSEMIE, WOORDGESCHIEDENISAbstract: Characterisation of the Etimologiewoordeboek van Afrikaans (EWA).In 2003, thirty six years after Afrikaanse etimologieë by Boshoff and Nienaber, a new etymologicaldictionary of Afrikaans has been published: the Etimologiewoordeboek van Afrikaans (EWA). There isa substantial difference between these two dictionaries. The work of Boshoff and Nienaber is almostentirely accessible only to specialists and not specifically meant for the general public. EWA isfirst and foremost meant for the layperson who is interested in the origin and the history of his/herown language. In addition it also offers a lot of data and inspiration for further research to etymologistsand historical linguists. EWA is an etymological dictionary with a number of special characteristics.The selection of the entry-words has been determined by the intended users. Consequently,EWA contains several kinds of words which are generally neglected in traditional etymologicaldictionaries, such as derivations, compounds, neologisms and colloquialisms. The entrystructure is characterized by a high degree of uniformity and consistency. The focus is on the socalledetymologia proxima, the nearest etymology that goes one step back and provides the most direct origin of a word. Furthermore, special attention has been paid to polysemy: not only theorigin of a word in its dominant sense has been given but also that of its other eventual sense(s).Explanations of naming are also frequently indicated. In a future second edition significant differencesin form or meaning should always be explained or certainly discussed. At present, these haverather often been neglected. Prior to such a subsequent edition, more research on word historicalmaterials from primary sources especially for the 17th–19th century should also be done. It wouldbe excellent if this first edition of EWA could lead to such an investigation.Keywords: ETYMOLOGIA PROXIMA, ETYMOLOGIA REMOTA, ETYMOLOGICAL DICTIONARY, ETYMOLOGY, LEXICOGRAPHY, LOAN TRANSLATION, MACROSTRUCTURE, MICROSTRUCTURE, POLYSEMY, WORD HISTORY, WORD ORIGIN",0,1
"An interesting body of data worth discussing in elementary phonology classes begins with the examples of the finite forms of the Latin verbs in (1).1As shown by the 1st person plural examples in (1a), the present tense forms consist of a Verb Stem followed by a Theme vowel and end with the 1st person plural Agr(eement) morpheme /-mus/. In the contrasting 1st person singular forms, shown in (1b), although the Theme vowel appears in /de:l-e-o:, aud-i-o:, cap-i-o:/, it does not appear in /port-o:, leg-o:/. How does one formally account for this difference?In traditional treatments of Latin grammar—for example, the summary of Latin grammar appended to The Pocket Oxford Latin Dictionary (Oxford University Press 1994) or to be found in Barron’s Latin Grammar (Maidhoff 2009)—the verbs are assigned to the same classes as in (1). The first three classes are classified by their long Theme vowel, and the last two are analyzed here as having the short Theme vowels /i/ and /I/. (Barron’s Grammar calls the /i/-verbs the mixed conjugation and the /I/-verbs the consonantal conjugation.)In the examples in (1), the Theme vowel /e:/ is never deleted (/de:l-e-o:/). By contrast, the Theme vowel /a:/ always deletes (/port-a:-o: → port-o:/) and /i/ varies: it deletes in /leg-o: ← leg-i-o:/, but not in /aud-i-o:, cap-i-o:/.At this point, it is essential to recall that phonemes are not further unanalyzable atoms; rather, they are clusters of phonetic features as illustrated in (2).The insight that phonemes are distinctive feature complexes of the kind illustrated in (2) requires us to state the deletion rule as shown in (3), where the deleted phonemes are represented as distinctive feature complexes.At this point, it is worth remarking that this idea is taken with complete seriousness below and that whenever phonemes are mentioned in the exposition, this is due to lapsing into informal language. In the representation that appears in actual computations of the pronunciation of words and utterances, phonemes are always understood as complexes of features, never as anything else.An important principle governing scientific accounts of all kinds is that they must be concise. Since the accounts proposed here are formulated in terms of feature complexes, conciseness in the present context implies that the accounts must use as few features as possible. From this perspective, rule (3b) would be especially problematic because it would require a very large number of features to represent the different words in List L. By contrast, rule (3a) is unproblematic, as it uses only three features. In accounts of actual languages, we expect to encounter rules like (3a), but not rules like (3b).One way of avoiding the need for a rule such as (3b) in Latin is by representing the Theme vowel /i/ that deletes (e.g., in /leg-o: ~ leg-i-mus/) with a different feature set than the vowel that does not delete (e.g., in /cap-i-o: ~ cap-i-mus/). In particular, it is assumed here that the vowel that deletes prevocalically is assigned the features [+back, −round, +high], which distinguish it from the nondeleting vowel, which is assigned the features [−back, −round, +high]. Once this is done, we assume that phonological theory requires us to restate the deletion rule (3a) in the (featurally more parsimonious) form shown in (4).The solution just sketched has a cost: it requires that we add a rule to account for the fact that when not deleted, /I/ surfaces as /i/. The additional rule, which mentions four features, is stated in (5).In view of the economies noted above, the extra cost of rule (5) can readily be borne.A crucial aspect of the account just presented is that rules were applied in a specific order; in particular, the fronting rule (5) was ordered after the deletion rule (4). To see that rule ordering is essential, recall that rule (5) turns /I/ into /i/. Therefore, if rule (5) had applied before rule (4), it would have fronted all underlying /I/ segments. There would have remained no [+back, −round] vowels to be deleted by rule (4). Since we know that underlying /I/ is not deleted by rule (4) in /leg-I-mus → leg-i-mus/, for example, we conclude that rule (4) must be ordered before rule (5), and from this we draw the further general inference that rules apply in a specific order.The perfect active forms of six verbs are given in (6a,c), along with their present forms in (6b,d) (all in 1st person plural).The verbs in (6a) preserve the Theme vowel in the perfect (cf. (6b)), whereas those in (6c) systematically fail to preserve the Theme vowel (cf. (6d)). To account for this fact, let us examine the abstract constituent structure of the perfect forms of two of the verbs in (6).As shown graphically in (7), we assume that the form on the right is subject to a transformation that links the /u/ to the Theme constituent and simultaneously delinks /a:/ from it, and that this is accompanied by the deletion of /a:/. We also assume that the sequence /u-i/ and its postvocalic alternant /v-i/ are reflexes of the Perfect morpheme.As illustrated in (8), the same formal delinking treatment accounts for the remaining perfects of the Latin verbal system.The s-perfects in (8a) all undergo the linking transformation illustrated in (7). The examples in (8b) demonstrate what we have already seen in (7): when the perfect takes the form /ui/, sometimes it undergoes a linking transformation as in /secuimus/, causing the Theme vowel to delete, and sometimes it does not, as in /porta:vimus/. The form /ce:pimus/ in (8c) exhibits the same effects of linking as, for example, /secuimus/. We mark this by assuming a Perfect morpheme /i/ augmented by the null segment: /Ø-i/ (i.e., Ø-I-Perf ). Finally, the forms in (8d) demonstrate that when the Theme vowel is /I/ and the Perfect morpheme is unaugmented, the Theme vowel always undergoes deletion.To summarize the account of the Latin perfect morphology illustrated in (8), we note that the Latin verbal system contains five Theme vowels, /a:, e:, i:, I, i/. We postulate that the Perfect morpheme is /i/. We further postulate that the Perfect morpheme /i/ can be augmented by three different segments: /s/ (see (8a)), /u/ (see (8b)), and /Ø/ (see (8c)). Each of these augmentations produces its own class of perfect. Given this analysis, we may say that linking always occurs with s-perfects and Ø-perfects. With u/v-perfects, it sometimes occurs and sometimes does not. Unaugmented perfects (see (8d)) never link.2An aspect of its morphology that Latin shares with many other languages, though not all, is that unmarked categories are (often) signaled by the absence of any phonetic marker. This is illustrated by the forms in (9), where each perfect form (in (9a)) includes the Perfect morpheme (/vi/ (or /ve/)), but the unmarked nonperfect forms in (9b) do not.This difference is formally expressed in (10) by enclosing the Perfect and [αFut] morphemes in angled brackets, which reflect the optional status of these two morphemes in the finite verb forms of Latin. Their status is “optional” in the sense that unlike the “obligatory” Verb Stem, Theme vowel, and Agr ending, the Perfect and [αFut] morphemes do not appear in every finite form of the Latin verb.In actual (pronounced) forms of the Latin verb, each of the four morphemes in (10) is supplied with its own sequence of phonemes.The morpheme [αFut] in (10) stands for [–Fut] and [+Fut], which are semantically interpreted as past and future, respectively; the absence of the [αFut] morpheme in the forms in the left column of (9) is interpreted semantically as present.The phonetic exponence of the [αFut] morpheme, which precedes the Agr morpheme in (10), is moderately complex. There are distinct phonetic exponents for [–Fut] and for [+Fut]. As shown in the second and third columns of (9), the phonetic exponent of [–Fut] is long /a:/, and that of [+Fut] is short /i/. Moreover, in the (marked) perfect forms of the verb in (9a), the consonant /r/ is preposed before the [αFut] morpheme (/port-a:-ve-r-a:-mus, port-a:-ve-r-i-mus/), but in the unmarked perfect forms in (9b), the consonant /b/ is preposed before [αFut] (/port-a:- b-a:-mus, port-a:-b-i-mus/). These facts are accounted for formally by the two rules in (11), which have not usually been recognized as parts of the phonology of Latin, but actually perform a distinct role in the morphology of the language.I assume the /r/ inserted by rule (11a) is the surface manifestation of an underlying /s/ by a rhotacism rule left unspecified.The phonetic exponents of the morpheme [αFut] are spelled out by the two Vocabulary Insertion rules in (12).This completes the present review of the finite active forms of the Latin verb. As shown in (10), these forms all begin with the Verb Stem and end with the Agr (Person) ending. Between these two terminal morphemes, there appear optionally a Perfect morpheme and/or a [αFut] (or Tense) morpheme. The abstract underlying structure of the Latin active verb forms is therefore as shown in (10), which abbreviates the six distinct sequences in (13).In (13), the Perfect morpheme is actualized phonetically as /i/~/e/. This alternation is formally captured by rule (14), which turns short /i/ into /e/ before /r/ and is ordered after rules (4) and (5).Among the rules discussed to this point—that is, (4), (5), (11), (12), (14), and the linking transformation—rule (11) stands out in that it alone includes mention of a nonphonological feature: [αFut].Rule (11) accounts for the augmentation of the morpheme [αFut]: where [αFut] is directly preceded by the Perfect morpheme, the rule preposes the phoneme /s/ before the [αFut] morpheme, and it preposes the phoneme /b/ elsewhere (i.e., where [αFut] is not preceded by the Perfect morpheme).In (10), the Latin verb is represented as a sequence of abstract morphemes: the string VbSt - 〈Perf〉 - 〈[αFut]〉 - Agr. The information about how these morphemes are pronounced is provided by special Vocabulary Insertion rules, of which two have been stated in (11). We have also postulated that the Perfect morpheme has three distinct exponents, whose underlying representations are /uI/ (illustrated also in (6)), /SI/, and /ØI/. These facts are formally reflected by the Vocabulary Insertion rule (15), which assigns particular sequences of phonemes to the Perfect morpheme. (16) provides examples.What makes the account of the perfect inflections somewhat complex is that in some verbs perfect stem formation is accompanied by the deletion of the Theme vowel (see (16b)) and that in other verbs perfect stem formation is accompanied either by lengthening of the Verb Stem vowel (see the first two examples in (16b)) or by its reduplication (see the second example in (16c) and (16e)). These details are not fully covered in the present account.In the present account—and this is a new proposal not found in other accounts to my knowledge—the phonetic actualization of the [αFut] morpheme depends crucially on the feature [high] of the Theme vowel. Specifically, as stated in the Vocabulary Insertion rule (17), the [–Fut] morpheme is actualized as /e:-ba:/ after stems with [+high] Theme vowels (see (18a)), and as /ba:/ elsewhere (i.e., after stems with [–high] Theme vowels; see (18b)). The obvious similarity between these two rules is not fully reflected in their representation in (18), as it involves abbreviatory devices that are left aside here.The deletion of the Theme vowel /I/ in /leg-e:-ba:-mus/ (from underlying /leg-I-e:-ba:-mus/) is due to the (subsequent) application of the vowel deletion rule (4). The feature [+high] of the Theme vowel also plays a role in the forms of the future [+Fut]. In these forms, [+Fut] is actualized as /e:/ after [+high] Theme vowels, and as /bI/ (→ /bi/) after [–high] Theme vowels. This is formally implemented by the Vocabulary Insertion rule (19), exemplified in (20).It is to be noted that in /leg-e:-mus/ (in (20a)) the Theme vowel /I/ is deleted by rule (4), just as in the [–Fut] /leg-e:-ba:-mus/ in (18a). Although rules (17) and (19) exhibit striking formal similarities, these further inferences are not incorporated into the present account.In nonperfect forms, the exponent of the Passive morpheme /r/ is placed at the very end of the word, as shown in (21) (putting aside here some further modifications).The situation is radically different in the perfect passive forms shown in (22).The underlying structure of the Latin active verb assumed throughout is as follows:In the passive forms in (22), the verb is split into two parts. One part consists of the optional 〈[αFut]〉 morpheme and the Agr ending, which are attached to the inserted auxiliary verb stem /es/ ‘be’. The second part, consisting of the Verb Stem and the Perfect morpheme, is merged into the perfect passive participle, which surfaces as /t/ ← /s/ after underlying stops and which, like the Perfect morpheme, may trigger deletion of the Theme vowel of the verb. The two pieces are shown in (24).The question to be answered at this point is where, in light of the facts just discussed, the Passive morpheme is to be placed with respect to the other morphemes in (23). Since the newly generated auxiliary verb /es/ ‘be’ is not a passive, the Passive morpheme must not be placed into the first of the two substrings in (24). We assume that the Passive morpheme is placed directly after the Verb Stem, so that the string underlying perfect passive verbs consists of the sequence in (25).To generate the correct surface sequence of morphemes from (25), we need to posit a transformation that moves the Passive morpheme to the end of the sequence in cases where the Perfect morpheme is absent, but leaves it in place elsewhere. This transformation, which is not further detailed here, will generate the sequences in (21) and (22).Note that the sequence of morphemes in (25) is identical to that of the auxiliary verb in modern German, illustrated here in detail in the form that it takes in subordinate clauses.This sequence of morphemes, where EnP stands for the Perfect Passive morpheme, is subject to a transformation that pairs each verb with the abstract morpheme on its right, generating the sequence in (27), which correctly reflects the German morpheme order.The essential identity of the structures in (25) and (26) evidently reflects the common Indo- European ancestry of Latin and modern German. To my knowledge, this parallel has not previously been observed.I conclude this review with a brief look at the parallel facts in English. As shown first in Chomsky 1957, the auxiliary verb in English has the underlying structure illustrated in (28), which is the reverse of the German order in (27).Like auxiliary verbs in German, auxiliary verbs in English are subject to the pairing transformation, with the effects shown in the bottom line of (28). Unlike its German counterpart, this transformation produces pairs with the elements in the wrong order—that is, pairs where the affixes precede rather than follow the verb. As shown in (29), this misformation is readily corrected by applying the “Affix-Hopping” transformation (Chomsky 1957).Setting aside the effects of Affix-Hopping, the auxiliary verbs in English and German are composed of identical elements and differ only in the left-to-right order in which the elements appear. The order of morphemes in German is the same as in Latin, and the main difference between Latin, on the one hand, and German (and English), on the other, is that in Latin the auxiliary verb /es/ is inserted only in the perfect passive and placed before the [αPast] morpheme, whereas in German and English each morpheme modifying the verb—[αPast], Modal, Perfect, Passive, and so on—constitutes a separate word, and each verb auxiliary is limited to taking just one affix.Whereas the order of the morphemes in Latin, German, and English is identical, the differences are noteworthy. In Latin, the verbal morphemes are simply added to the Verb Stem, one after the other, in typical agglutinative fashion. In German, however, there appears to be a limit to the number of morphemes that can be added to a Verb Stem: namely, one. This limitation has led to the development of the auxiliary system of the VP. The accompanying tree in German is obviously left-branching. In English, on the other hand, the tree is right-branching. If we assume that head dominance is a parameter, we can argue that the switch from the Germanic left-branching VP to its right-branching English counterpart is what necessitated the rule of Affix-Hopping in English. In other words, English Affix-Hopping is a repair rule required when the head dominance of the VP switched from left to right in English.Perhaps a methodological comment is appropriate in bringing this note to its conclusion. I remarked at the outset that I was committed to a theory of phonology that takes seriously such notions as distinctive features, parsimony of accounts, and simplicity, saying “An important principle governing scientific accounts of all kinds is that they must be concise.” Following in the spirit of these constraints, I arrived at an abstract morphological account of Latin whose resemblance to German was as striking as it was unexpected. That, in turn, led to the account of Affix-Hopping in English as a morphological repair rule, again an unexpected result. I take this latter insight as corroboration of the phonological theory that gave rise to it.In sum, as the Mishnah tells us:and there is much work, and the master keeps urging on . . .On July 23, 2013, Morris Halle celebrated his 90th birthday. To honor that occasion, a two-day conference was held at MIT on September 20–21 of the same year. Morris gave a brilliant talk on Latin morphology, a topic that has been investigated in depth for too long to remember. Astonishingly, Morris made some surprising new discoveries, and in the style that he pioneered over many years of outstanding work, the discoveries enabled him to provide a deep explanation for phenomena that had, basically, been listed. And as an aside, he provided important new insight into one of the earliest syntactic problems addressed in modern generative grammar 65 years ago.Working together with Jay Keyser, Morris prepared successive drafts of a paper to be submitted for publication, with steady improvements. Tragically, he was unable to bring this work to a conclusion. The latest draft, virtually complete, is presented here—a fitting testimonial to the distinguished career of a remarkable person, whose legacy is an inspiration for all of those who seek to follow in his footsteps.In his letters, Isaac Newton famously wrote that “[i]f I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants.” Morris’s colleagues, students, grand-students, and others who aspire to extend his legacy will be able to say the same.",0,1
"Abstract This article offers a comment on the ways multilingual language users perceive their L2 and L3 learning experiences at the level of appraisals, that is, variables that ‘assign value to current stimuli based on past experience’. In the theoretical part of the article the concept of appraisals is introduced and briefly outlined from the different perspectives of different existing taxonomies. Also a tool for measuring appraisal systems, the Geneva Appraisal Questionnaire (GAQ), is discussed in respect of its content and structure. This paper aims to compare experiences and factors involved in the development of L2 vs. L3 in two groups of multilinguals, as seen in their meaningful learning-related episodes (Group 1) and open-ended retrospective comments (Group 2). The comments are made in relation to appraisal values such as novelty, intrinsic pleasantness, coping potential and compatibility with norms and their significance in L2 vs. L3 learning processes, as expressed by the subjects in their responses to the GAQ categories (stimulus evaluation checks) and reflections.",0,1
"The German Konjunktiv II is known for its reportative and irrealis uses. This paper argues for a third, realis, use which is independent of the other two uses. Thus by uttering ‘Da wäre Saft im Kühlschrank there is.[realis subjunctive] juice in the fridge’ a speaker can signal that not only is she certain that there is juice in the fridge, but also that she is offering the juice to an interlocutor. I show that the meaning contribution of the realis subjunctive is strictly not-at-issue, and I develop a multi-dimensional formal semantics that captures both the distribution of the realis subjunctive, and its interaction with operators such as negation and tense.

Raters were all university Chinese teachers of English majors. Seventy-three participants in stage one and 75 in stage two responded to the same questionnaire. Both exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis were used in data analysis. Results showed that there were generally six broad factors interfering with the rating process: rating scale, rater training, rating supervision, rater characteristics, eye-catching text features and rating condition. The interaction of those factors reflected the tension between the constraints executed by the test institution and raters’ own knowledge and understanding of essay rating. This study may shed light on measures taken to improve essay rating quality.",0,1

"Abstract In this article I provide evidence that despite frequently cited differences between child first language (L1) and adult second language (L2) speakers in overt behavior (performance) during grammatical development, the nature, source, and limits of implicit knowledge (competence) in native and second language grammars are equivalent (i.e., they share a common epistemology; Schwartz (1986) Schwartz, B. D. 1986. The Epistemological Status of Second Language Acquisition. Second Language Research, 2: 120–159. [Google Scholar]). Evidence for this claim comes from the intuitions of L1 English-speaking classroom learners of French with respect to two properties of the French nominal system, both of which are posited to be the surface manifestations of a single parametric option for noun movement within a D(eterminer) P(hrase). These include (i) the distinction between result and process nominals in the licensing of postnominal genitives and (ii) the distinction between prenominal and postnominal adjective position in the context of unique versus nonunique noun referents. An analysis of the results of an acceptability judgment task administered to 100 university-level learners, 27 native French speakers, and 30 native English-speaker controls demonstrated that particular interpretive asymmetries associated with these properties, although underdetermined in the input and not syntactically instantiated in English, nonetheless appeared in the interlanguage grammars of the study participants. Moreover, changes in learner response patterns by level were highly suggestive of a developmental path involving an initial English-like parse of the test sentences followed by a parametric shift at the 3rd-year level, leading to increasingly more native-like intuitions at later levels wherein both properties cluster together. Such results call into question the need for theories of L2 acquisition positing selective transfer, selective impairment, or both at the level of syntactic representation.",0,1

This article analyses the ISN as reflector of the moral and ideological values of the Ndebele society. The ISN highlights fundamental beliefs and ideas of the Ndebele people. The study stems from the observation that the culture of a people will always reflect in a dictionary as culture and language are inextricably intertwined. The aim of this article is to discuss the ways in which the ISN reflects the moral and ideological values of society. The article examines how the society in which the dictionary was created influenced the choice of lemmas and the phrasing of definitions. The focus is on sexist definitions, terms referring to ethnic groups and the treatment of taboo words and religious terms. These terms denote cultural attitudes harboured by the Ndebele society.

My comments will focus on Modularity Matching. First, I elaborate on Drozd's suggestion that C&amp;T's comparisons between Modularity Matching and other (potential) models do not provide convincing support for their model. Second, I suggest that Modularity Matching, while a strong claim, considers such a narrow range of phenomena in child language that its usefulness in explaining language development in general is likewise constrained.",0,1
"Abstract The morpheme dāk 得 has a broad range of functions in modern Cantonese, including being used as a particle introducing an adverbial construction, as a particle introducing the so-called ‘potential complement’ (we refer to this as the ‘long potential’) and as a verbal (quasi-)suffix (the ‘short potential’), which indicates that the state of affairs denoted by the verb may happen. In this paper, we first offer a general introduction on dāk 得 in modern Cantonese, which we then compare with Mandarin de 得 and parallel acquisitive modals in Lao, Vietnamese, and Zhuang, also with a focus on their modal meanings. We will then provide a diachronic overview of Cantonese dāk 得 based on a sample of texts from the 19th and early 20th century written in Cantonese by Western scholars, missionaries, and officers. The historical Cantonese data will be analyzed and compared to the development of the cognate morpheme de 得 in mainstream Chinese written sources: because of the limited diachronic depth of Cantonese data, this is necessary to delve further into the history of this item and of the related constructions. We will argue that: a. all the contemporary Cantonese (and Mandarin) uses seem to derive from the attainment sense of postverbal de / dāk 得; b. the vast majority of possible word order configurations were attested at some point in the recorded history of Chinese, but there appear to be also some patterns which could be specific to Cantonese; c. there seems to be a (partial) structural and semantic split between the ‘short’ potential and the ‘long’ potential; d. the adverbial construction probably had a more straightforward development.",0,1
"Abstract Painful pains are, paradigmatically, unpleasant and motivating. The dominant view amongst philosophers and pain scientists is that these two features are essentially related and sufficient for painfulness. In this article, I first offer scientifically informed characterizations of both unpleasantness and motivational oomph and argue against other extant accounts. I then draw on folk‐characterized cases and current neurobiological and neurobehavioral evidence to argue that both dominant positions are mistaken. Unpleasantness and motivational oomph doubly dissociate and, even taken together, are insufficient for painfulness.",0,1

"Earlier research has found that phonological markedness constraints (for example, against stress clash or sibilant sequences) statistically influence speakers’ choices between particular syntactic constructions and between synonymous words. In this study, we test phonological constraints not just in particular cases, but across the board. We employ a novel method that statistically models the distribution of word bigrams (consecutive two-word sequences) and how this distribution is influenced by phonological constraints. Our study of multiple corpora indicates that several phonological constraints do indeed play a statistically significant role in English sentence formation. We also show that by examining particular subsets of the corpora we can diagnose the mechanisms whereby phonologically marked sequences come to be underrepresented.We conclude by discussing modes of grammatical organization compatible with our findings.",0,1
"The Turkic languages, which include Tatar and Turkish, have not been major lexical donors to English: Turkish ranks thirtieth in the best available list of donor languages, just below Hawaiian and Scottish Gaelic and just above Welsh and Norwegian (Durkin 2014: 27). However, a number of loanwords in the transmission of which they have played a part occur at high frequency, for instance turban, coffee, and yogurt. Material from the Turkic languages is therefore handled in all English dictionaries with an etymological component. Since etymologists of English have not usually had a Turcological background, and since histories of transmission which involve the Turkic languages are often very complex, different dictionaries have shown different degrees of expertise in their handling of this material, and have come to different conclusions about it in individual cases. Hence Mateusz Urban’s study, a lightly revised version of his Kraków PhD thesis, which brings Turcological expertise to bear on an examination of the etymologies in a series of English dictionaries from Wedgwood (1859-67) to OED3 (2000- ).",0,1

"A compositional analysis is provided of temporal perspective and orientation (Condoravdi 2002) of modals in Dutch, English, Gitksan (Tsimshianic), and St’át’imcets (Lillooet Salish). Modals interact freely with the tense-aspect architecture in each language. Temporal perspective is determined by an operator scoping over the modal, usually tense, while temporal orientation is determined by aspectual operators below it (and further restricted by the diversity condition). In contrast to much of the literature, it is argued that epistemic modals can scope under past tense. Modal-temporal interactions behave in predictable ways in Dutch, Gitksan, and St’át’imcets, whereas the English system is more idiosyncratic and partly lexicalized.*",0,1
"Subjective intelligibility tests were carried out by processing speech through personal and non-personal Head-Related Transfer Functions (HRTF) for azimuth angle θ=+30∘ (sound source to the right), presented through headphones, under simulated adverse listening conditions. Tests with noise disturbance were also conducted at azimuth angles of θ=0∘, 15° and 45°. Phonetically balanced bi-syllable words in Spanish, uttered by a mexican female speaker, were used as speech material. Stimuli were convolved with personal or non-personal HRTF, and artificially contaminated with noise or reverberation, interaurally correlated or uncorrelated at the left and right ears. Results at θ=30∘ show that binaural speech intelligibility scores reduce slightly to moderately with non-personal HRTF, compared to personal HRTF, for these types of acoustic disturbance. Average intelligibility score reductions of ΔI=−7.6%, and −12.1%, were found statistically significant, p(Δ I ≠ 0) > 0.99, respectively for interaurally correlated and uncorrelated noise. Reductions of intelligibility with reverberation were found smaller: −1.9%, p=0.63, and −4.1%, p > 0.99, respectively for interaurally correlated and uncorrelated reverberation, the reduction being smaller, and statistically less significant for interaurally correlated reverberation. A tentative simple model of speech intelligibility is also presented, based on the modulation index theory, under the better-ear binaural assumption, and the spectral distortion metric to quantify HRTF differences, in an attempt to incorporate the effects of non-personal HRTF in speech intelligibility. The model explains correctly the qualitative trend of the results, but it overpredicts the observed reductions of the intelligibility scores, showing that spectral distortion of HRTF is probably too simplified, and insufficient to provide an accurate or suitable explanation in this context. Results with noise disturbance at other angles are as follows. At 0°, intelligibility scores decrease for non-personal HRTF with interaurally correlated noise (L=R), but increase with uncorrelated noise (L ≠ R). At 15°, intelligibility scores decrease in both conditions. At 45°, no change is observed.",0,1

"Discussions of folklinguistic accounts of language use are frequently focused on dismissing them because of their limitations. As a result, not a lot is written regarding how such accounts are done and how they “work.” This article examines how folklinguistic evaluations are achieved in interaction, particularly through appeals to semiotic registers (Agha 2007). It describes how in explaining their beliefs regarding linguistic variation, speakers frequently produce voicings with varying transparency. These rely on understandings of the social world and bring large collections of linguistic resources into play. They offer rich insights if analytic attention is given to their details because even when evaluating a single variant, whole ways of speaking, and even being, may be utilized. The paper explores in turn how analysis reveals the inseparability of variants, understandings of context and audience, the relationship between linguistic forms and social types, and the performance of social types via the evaluation of semiotic resources. In each section, discussion is grounded in extracts from interviews on Australian English with speakers of this variety of English. Cumulatively they show the primacy of semiotic registers in ethno‐metapragmatic accounts.",0,1

"Quotation Paragraphs in Specialized Glossaries on Historical Principles Michael Adams Indiana University Anyone who prepares a specialized glossary on historical principles will consider what purposes quotation paragraphs in such a glossary serve. Eventually, the audior of such a glossary will have to compile those paragraphs, and, as A.J. Aitken has argued, those paragraphs are the fundamental component of any historical dictionary. Indeed, diough users often think of definitions as primary, ""definitions remain subservient to the citations diemselves,"" because ""dieir function is simply to identify separate sets of citations; more specifically, they serve as finding-aids or sign-posts to particular sections of a long entry, [and] they specify the criteria which distinguish one division of citations from one another"" (Aitken 1973a, 259). The audior of a historical glossary should be able to justify the selection of quotations according to some mixture of principle and praxis, though die principles, at least, may prove elusive. I have this problem in mind because, when I was writing Slayer Slang: A Buffy the Vampire Slayer Lexicon (2003), I realized that determining the role of quotation paragraphs was really to determine the scope, purpose, and value of the work. Quotation paragraphs in Slayer Slangbear a somewhat heavier burden than is typical of dictionaries organized on historical principles. The strain of pulling along more information than might at first glance seem desirable or even useful was unavoidable were I to satisfy the book's several purposes and audiences. Those who write full-scale historical dictionaries do not encounter this problem: from a thousand quotations, diey choose die minimal set mat Dictionaries:Journal oftheDictionary Soaety ofNorth America 27 (2006), 155-161 156Michael Adams fully illustrates a word's meaning and linguistic (sometimes also extralinguistic ) characteristics. One who compiles a glossary of fairly narrow scope will have to ask how often and how deep to plumb the resources of the whole language in order to make sense of the specialized vocabulary in question. Slayer slang includes a much that deviates from general American English adverbial much; the form is relatively frequent in slayer slang and is a hallmark of slayer style, but it did not originate with Buffy the Vampire Slayer, nor do all of its important developments first occur in Buffy context . If you trip while walking with a sarcastic friend, the friend might ask, ""Walk much?"" This VERB + much pattern is not the one mainly at issue in slayer slang; radier, adjective + much and noun + much are the emerging slang forms, as in ""Pathetic much?"" and ""Broken record much?"" No one has yet found an instance of adjective + much prior to the film Heathers (1989), but it was used between that film and die first season of Buffy (1997). No one has yet found noun + much before 1998, when it appeared in Mademoiselle and die filmJawbreaker. The quotation paragraph for the Slayer Slang entry much includes forty-four items ranging in date from 1992 (the release of die film Buffy the Vampire Slayer) and 26July 2002 (the day on which I stopped collecting material for Slayer Slang). Nine quotations are taken from the film or television series (one of these comes from the spin-off series, Angel, in which it is spoken by the same character who typically uses slayer slang much in Buffy) ; eleven quotations are culled from Buffy novels , as well as books and magazine articles about the show; thirteen occurred on the official Buffy posting board or in other Buffy related chat rooms. Thus three quarters of the quotations plausibly illustrate slayer slang, or language of the Buffyverse — the universe of all tilings Buffy. The remaining ten quotations, however, are taken from sources entirely unrelated to the Buffy text or text that consciously imitates Buffyspeak, and therein lies the problem: how does one know which non-Buffy quotations are important additions to die much quotation paragraph, or, by analogy, any non-X quotations to a quotation paragraph in any X-glossary complied on historical principles? SlayerSlangis the first philological treatment of a television show. Obviously, it appeals to fans of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, scholarly or otiierwise , but the range of interests is rather large and elements of it incompatible . Fans who...",0,1

"Abstract What research is conducted on language processing and how that research is conducted are largely determined by researchers' assumptions about the functional organization of mental processes. These have changed significantly since the 1970s when the brain's role in language processing—although acknowledged—was practically inconsequential to psycholinguistic research or theory; this change is due in large part to considerable growth in knowledge of brain structure and function. I argue that when language is properly appreciated as one brain function among many, psycholinguistics will benefit from heeding certain factors that have received proportionately little attention within mainstream psycholinguistic research: (a) the hemispheres; (b) time and timing; (c) context liberally construed to include, for example, personality traits and mood; and (d) individual differences as a proxy for experience. I conclude with why it has not been so easy to answer such fundamental questions as where in the brain language is localized, and how activation of these language areas leads to understanding. The main message is that researchers of nonliteral language processing can benefit from the significant progress in the neurosciences in the past few decades more by thinking of language as brain function and as an experience than by viewing it merely as the (localizable) seat of nonliteral language. I recommend actively and seriously incorporating brain principles into thinking about all language processes and how best to investigate them.",0,1

"Abstract This study explored the affective, behavioral, and cognitive engagement of 18 Iranian EFL learners with oral corrective feedback on lexical stress errors. The data were collected using questionnaires, pretests, posttests, and interviews. The questionnaire responses showed that the participants held various perceptions about direct feedback. Additionally, the pretest and posttest results indicated that the learners with positive perceptions about direct feedback had significant lexical stress accuracy gains. Also, the students who viewed direct feedback favorably showed positive affective, behavioral, and cognitive engagement with it. These learners, for instance, frequently reviewed the provided feedback and used cognitive resources when utilizing it. In contrast, the students with negative perceptions about direct feedback showed negative engagement with it. The findings suggest that learners’ affective, behavioral, and cognitive engagement can determine the working of feedback. Also, students’ perceptions seem to filter the feedback they receive, thereby helping shape how they engage with feedback.",0,1

"The Standards for Korean language learning is a tour de force that serves as an exemplary model for other world language education programs. The dedicated efforts of the authors have provided the field with a set of well-articulated and robust expectations and learning outcomes across seven proficiency levels including a notable separate heritage language (HL) level. This work lays a solid foundation for continued advancements in learning outcomes and pedagogy in Korean language education.There are several impressive points about the proposed Korean standards. First, the systematic design of the learning progression increments reflects a deep understanding of realistic performance outcomes across a broad range of language learners as well as the needs of language learners, in particular, those unique to HL learners. The presentation of the learning progression in a spiraling manner not only enables a smooth transition from level to level, but also takes into account learning slides that may happen over nonacademic months. Second, the comprehensive articulation of learning goals that covers the multiple facets of language performance including communicative functions, contexts, content topics, text types, language control, targeted vocabulary, communication strategies, and cultural awareness of learners at the different proficiency levels are presented in an accessible manner. The learning goals and performance indicators can easily become overwhelming; however, the inclusion of sample texts, audiovisual materials, and suggested classroom activities makes it possible for even the most novice language teacher to effectively and successfully utilize. Yet, it must be noted that although the standards are proposed for K–16 grade levels and are described to allow enough flexibility for adaptation for individual student populations, the proposed curricula were mainly designed with a post-secondary student audience in mind. In future revisions, perhaps inclusion of some K–12 models and sample units as well as more involvement from K–12 educators would be ideal. Third, its strong alignment with the language and communication goals of the Common Core Standards as well as the five Cs of the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages (ACTFL) standards contributes to a consistent educational trajectory that places Korean language learning in alliance with the learning goals of other content areas. However, one of the most significant aspects about this version of the Standards for Korean Learning, in my opinion, is its distinct treatment of the learning objectives and performance indicators for HL learners. Given the immense diversity of backgrounds of HL learners ranging from differences in exposure to Korean, maintenance efforts, motivation, investment, and proficiency levels in addition to our shallow understanding of the unique linguistic and sociopsychological characteristics of HL learners, generating these performance standards must have been a very challenging task. These initial efforts have filled an important gap in the field and have created a blueprint upon which to refine our thinking and plans for Korean HL education.The HL curriculum (pp. 235–272) consists of five themes starting with “I, We,” “Leisure Life,” “Preparing to visit Korea,” “Life in Korea,” and “Korean Culture.” The curriculum strikes a nice balance between introduction to content topics that are likely to be of high relevance to HL learners and the development of their proficiency in standard Korean language use. For example, the inclusion of the history of Korean immigration and important Korean American figures in the 100-plus year history of Korean immigration to the United States is a topic that all Korean Americans should learn, but rarely have an opportunity to study in their K–12 schooling. Recently, my high school daughter heard the son of Susan Ahn Cuddy, the first female gunnery officer in the U.S. Navy who was of Korean descent, speak about his mother; her life story sparked an interest to learn more about other Korean Americans which also fueled a motivation to better understand her position as a Korean American in this society. This learning opportunity not only contributed to her developing sense of ethnic identity, but also provided another channel for her to develop her Korean language proficiency. For my daughter, this opportunity was serendipitous; however, these standards are likely to assure this kind of critical learning opportunity for all Korean HL learners. There were other topic areas that could have addressed more specifically relevant issues for Korean HL learners. As an example, the “Life in Korea” section that covers public transportation, shopping, and health reflects topics that are commonly addressed in most textbooks for the prototypical world language learner; however, this could have been a section where issues of stereotypes of Kyopos (Korean Americans) and prejudices toward Kyopos by native Koreans as well as attitudes toward Korean HL maintenance could be discussed.In addition, although there is some overlap with the non-HL curricula, the HL curriculum is presented with alterations and extensions that appear to be more representative of the unique HL learner contexts and experiences. For example, while in Level 1 the focus is on identifying key expressions and in Level 2 producing them, the HL curriculum, which straddles Levels 1 and 2, focuses on having learners recognize core differences in cultural practices, registers, and speech levels. Thereby, learners are guided to develop an understanding of how their familiar Korean language use and cultural practices relate to native Korean and American practices. This is an important point of contrast because it indicates that the proposed HL curriculum recognizes the potential hybrid nature of HL language use and cultural practices. Hornberger and Wang (2008) state that concepts of mediation and hybridity are valuable in understanding how different varieties of a language, communicative modes, cultural practices, and language development paths happen among HL learners. That is, hybridity is an association or mixture of ideas, concepts, and/or linguistic features that are likely to occur when different languages and cultures come into contact. Although more research is needed to identify the specifics and breadth of the hybridity of Korean HL, some of the proposed activities acknowledge that Korean HL learners possess unique cultural practices. For instance, there are many suggested activities that encourage learners to compare and contrast Korean, Korean American, and American cultures in regard to manners and daily routines (p. 173). Yet, this recognition is not consistent throughout the HL curriculum.There are many other aspects of hybridity that have yet to be included in the curriculum. For instance, HL learners may be faced with challenging decisions about when and how to use English and Korean in their social domains, and how to manage the coexistence of various standard and/or nonstandard varieties of English and Korean. Furthermore, there may be vocabulary and morphological constructions that are uniquely used by HL speakers, but do not appear as valid constructions in the textbooks. Such hybrid cultural practices and hybrid language features (e.g., code-switching, morphological blending, and lexical borrowing) that are often marked forms of Korean American culture and speech need to be validated and valued rather than treated as errors to be corrected (Lee & Shin, 2008). This brings up an interesting question about whether Korean HL language use should mirror the language of native monolingual Korean speakers in Korea. HL speakers generally learn and use Korean within Korean American communities that are created at the contact points of Korean and American culture, which have different norms and expectations than Korean speakers in Korea (Shin and Lee, 2014). Thus, it does not make sense to expect HL learners to adopt the norms and practices of a speech community that is less relevant to them because of existing beliefs about what constitutes “standard” or “correct” language use. HL learners should have the opportunity to learn about standard language use and its variance from their personal language practices to make informed decisions about their language use.As much as I am impressed with the advancements made in the HL curriculum, I am still left with some fundamental questions such as what specific characteristics of HL learners the authors had in mind when constructing the curriculum. Understanding who HL learners are is a complex task. Gonzalez Pino and Pino (2000) found that university-identified HL students did not self-identify as an HL learner, displayed less confidence in their language abilities and skills, desired more in-depth analysis of their linguistic skills and curricular needs, internalized societal negative attitudes toward their particular language use, and resisted being separated/segregated into HL tracks. We know that there are differences between HL and non-HL students in terms of their language development, motivations to learn, and performance outcomes, yet there is little consensus as to who constitutes an HL learner and what their unique range of linguistic characteristics are. This fundamental lack of information is the source of the remaining questions that I have about the design of the HL curriculum and the proposed performance indicators.The articulated proficiency levels appear to roughly coincide with the duration of instruction in a university setting (p. 154). It is stated that there are six levels aligned with the ACTFL novice to advance high proficiency levels and the heritage level straddles Levels 1 and 2. The heritage levels are also separated into Levels 1 and 2. The entry proficiency for HL Levels 1 and 2 is not specified probably because of the wide range of HL experiences and exposure, and the projected proficiency objectives are indicated as intermediate low for HL Level 1 and intermediate mid for HL Level 2. There are several points of confusion here. Why do the HL levels straddle between Levels 1 and 2 and aim to reach only an intermediate mid production level? I would assume that given the diversity of HL learners, one would expect to have HL learners across all proficiency levels. Moreover, one of the main arguments for wider societal support for HL education is that HL speakers have the greatest potential to reach the advanced high proficiency levels that are needed in academic and professional sectors such as government and business. Yet, the highest HL curriculum level only projects production to be at the intermediate mid level. Thereby, a fuller consideration of an HL curriculum should be in parallel to Levels 1–6 or more closely integrated across all proficiency levels.Further, in the proposed set of objectives (pp. 155–174), the HL learning objectives overlap with objectives from other proficiency levels. For example, the objective of “demonstrating awareness of the nuances of speech level and choices and their implications for the relationships between speakers in different social situations” overlap with one of the objectives in Level 5, whereas others such as “students recognize and compare the organizational principle in the Korean language of general-to specific, and macro-to micro with that of their own language” coincides with one from Level 1. How were decisions made to include or not include certain learning objectives in the HL category? What was the rationale behind the broad range of overlap in learning objectives across proficiency levels? Perhaps, future versions of the HL curriculum would benefit from a systematic set of grounding principles to guide the design of learning objectives.In sum, these standards are undoubtedly a timely and significant contribution toward the larger goal of producing translingual and transcultural communicators and collaborators in our global context. World language education has come a long way in producing speakers of a language that can operate between and across languages and cultures in contrast to just knowers of the grammatical aspects of a language. Despite these advancements, however, what is still a bit surprising is how much world language standards are still driven by ideologies of linguistic hegemony (Valdés, González, López García, & Márquez, 2008) and the dominant culture of college-level foreign language departments that place greater focus on academic language, functions and canonical literature, and history rather than other more everyday common topics such as K-pop culture that may drive students' interest and motivation to learn and speak Korean. The notion of the monolingual educated native speaker continues to permeate throughout all standards where the idealized goal seems to be acquiring noncontaminated language forms and usage of a monolingual native speaker of Korean. However, as Einar Haugen (1972 as cited in Valdés et al., 2008, p. 126) pointed out when immigrant languages come into contact with English “each language has been forced to adapt itself to new conditions.” Thus, native speaker-like proficiency should not or may not be the target goal of language learners as is assumed by the standards.In addition, the belief that language learning and teaching must proceed from simple cognitive tasks to complex cognitive tasks to mirror the acquisition of simple language forms to more complex language forms is very prominent in the proposed standards. Yet, we know from research on English as second language learners that students who have limited proficiency are still able to engage in cognitively demanding tasks; therefore, the simple to complex academic task continuum needs to be reconsidered, especially when dealing with a range of different grade levels and HL learners. We need to keep in mind that language proficiency should not be a barrier to engaging in complex tasks and that it should be engagement with topic and need for HL language use that should drive the curriculum. That is, as we move forward, we should think of ways to build a coherent curriculum that stimulates learners to learn and speak the language at every proficiency level, rather than holding off until a certain threshold of proficiency is developed to engage with topics that may be of great interest to the learner. For example, the topic of K-pop presents an authentic opportunity to engage and motivate not only HL learners, but all Korean language learners. Our family hosted an exchange student from Afghanistan who shared with us how popular Korean dramas and music was among her peers in Afghanistan. The reach of K-pop culture never ceases to amaze us! Moreover, my teenage daughters tell me that their friends envy their ability to understand Korean without having to read subtitles in the dramas they watch together and how her non-Korean friends are wanting to learn Korean to access K-pop more readily. This presents a natural hook that should be optimally utilized as motivators and pedagogical instruments. The proposed Korean standards have successfully integrated the power of Hallyu in the suggested teaching materials and activities, yet defined learning goals related to Korean popular culture does not appear until Level 3, when in fact, such goals can be incorporated even in the very beginning levels. Our steadfast belief that language learning should progress some simple to complex rather than be driven by interest and need may result in missed opportunities to utilize learners' motivation to learn and speak Korean for better learning outcomes.There is still much to do to create learning environments and conditions that produce strong communicators in a globalized world where assumptions and expectations are rapidly changing. I think future work on HL standards will greatly benefit from more research on the characteristics of HL language use as well as documentation of effective and feasible assessment practices. As I mentioned earlier, HL curriculum may benefit from a set of grounding principles that can help define learning objectives. However, in order to identify HL-specific principles, we need more research on the following: Psychological and attitudinal issues of HL learners to help them overcome their linguistic insecurities in speaking Korean in public. According to Hornberger and Wang (2008), many HL learners experience language shyness due to the ways in which they produce their forms that may be considered nonstandard or hybrid. Thus, HL curriculum needs to incorporate opportunities for learners to gain guidance in dealing with the sociopsychological effects of stigma attached to their personal HL language use. HL learners will also need positive reinforcement from their instructors who can further explain the benefits (e.g., having linguistic and cultural intuition) and differences (e.g., knowing a nonstandard from of Korean) of being an HL learner.Linguistic features of HL speakers to be better prepared to understand and address code-switching, lexical borrowing, and semantic extensions that are typical of Korean HL/bilingual speakers. HL learners need to be able to make informed decisions about when it is appropriate to use these linguistic features as well as develop a metalinguistic ability to use their language intuitions to acquire the grammatical rules of Korean. Furthermore, living at the intersection of English and Korean, HL speakers may have unique ways of pronunciation, literacy practices, and morphological creations that need to be identified and acknowledged as legitimate ways of language use in the different Korean-American communities of HL speakers. In addition, sociolinguistic research on social variations, language change, diglossia, use of registers, and language attitudes among Korean HL learners is needed to continually track the dynamic and changing practices within HL communities.Cultural extensions (i.e., Korean-American cultural idiosyncrasies that result from Korean mannerisms are applied to American contexts and vice versa) and syncretism (i.e., new practices mixing cultures) to help develop a more informed cultural curriculum that highlights the uniqueness of the Korean-American experience.In addition, I believe the next task in line is to create standards for Korean HL teacher preparation. Most HL learners are taught by teachers who do not have the necessary training to make appropriate adaptations to meet the needs of HL learners (Schwartz Caballero, 2014). Currently, there are no certification, licensure, or endorsements in teaching of HL learners. To maximize the benefits of the implementation of Korean language standards for HL learners, we must focus our attention on preparing effective HL teachers who have knowledge of HL students and their needs as well as an understanding of societal bilingualism, language contact, and how immigrant bilinguals function (Schwartz Caballero, 2014). Thus, in addition to the need for more research on HL linguistic characteristics and language development, there is an urgent need for classroom-based research that can illuminate pedagogical strategies, program models, and curricular content that work well for HL learners of different backgrounds. As I imagine directions for future work that builds on this volume, I am excited about the potential connections and possibilities that will emerge by opening up the conversation beyond the context of Korean with other scholars engaged in deep thinking about world language and HL education more globally.",0,1
"1 argue that the Tiberian system of accents which annotate the text of the Hebrew Bible has a prosodic basis. Accentual representations are constructed in terms of units somewhat similar to the modern prosodic hierarchy, and they deviate from syntactic constituency in ways that are characteristic of prosodic representations. They are con- strained by the effects of syntactic edges, geometric properties of prosodic phrases, principles for organizing phrases into higher-level constituents, and position in the phrase, associated with variations in tempo. It is shown that the Tiberian representation can best be understood by integrating results of phonological, phonetic, and psycholinguistic re- search on prosodic structure.* INTRODUCTION 1. The Hebrew Bible text is annotated with a system of diacritic marks called ACCENTS. These accents, assigned to every word in the Bible, parse each verse in minute detail. The nature and purpose of this complex system of represen- tation, developed in and around Tiberias over several generations up until the tenth century, has been much debated. Some scholars have suggested that it is intended to be a kind of syntactic representation, or else a system devised to indicate logical and semantic relations among words and phrases. I will argue that it is best viewed as providing a prosodic representation, designed to in- dicate the correct phrasing of the text. I will show that many characteristic properties of the Tiberian system of accents follow directly from basic prin- ciples of prosodic theory and are typical of the prosodic structure of other languages. Viewing the Tiberian accentuation from the perspective of prosodic theory also sheds light on elements of the system which have long appeared to be problematic. Conversely, the Tiberian system merits study, as it displays an extraordinary complexity and subtlety which may contribute to our under- standing of prosodic representation in general. The plan of this article is as follows. Section 2 is a brief introduction to the system of accents, its background, and its purpose. In ?3 the accentual rep- resentation is considered in the light of recent proposals in prosodic theory,",0,1
"Sociolinguistic studies on the globalization of hip hop have focused on multilingual lyrics as emblematic of superdiversity and hybrid identity, but the multimodal turn in sociolinguistics suggests the need to consider how lyrics interact with musical and visual features. Drawing on studies of music videos, TV ads, and film in cultural and media studies and multimodal studies, this paper examines an under-researched area of hip hop, the global spread of Chicano rap, by conducting a multilingual, multimodal critical discourse analysis of several videos by Mona AKA Sad Girl, a Japanese rapper whose lyrics switch between Japanese, Spanish, and English. This genre-based study looks at how the artist constructs a feminist glocal identity through a combination of song lyrics, musical style, cultural iconography, body decoration, gesture and film techniques that localize the oppositional super-vernacular of Chicano rap while challenging discourses of patriarchy and nationalism. The study also takes into account data from an interview with the artist and social media to gain insights into issues of authenticity and cultural appropriation.",0,1
"Indigenous loanwords comprise an important component of the lexicons of the Englishes of former British colonies. Often these words are used as placenames, which are in turn transported across the country with little knowledge of their origin or meaning.

"Prototype Theory provides new insights into the structure of polysemy. In order to apply these insights, researchers recommend that logical sense ordering be used to represent the polysemic structure in English learners’ dictionaries. However, our examination of entries quoted from MEDAL2 reveals that logical sense ordering and its enhanced versions encounter difficulties in structuring polysemy: they can neither do justice to the multidimensional structure of polysemy nor clarify how one sense extends to another. We propose drawing a semantic graph as a supplement to the linearly-structured entry, enhancing the graph with sense link illustrations modeled on the COBUILD defining style, and presenting both the graph and the illustrations in a customizable way.",0,1
"A syntactically optional constituent in a sentence can be deleted if it is recoverable from the preceding context. This does not mean, however, that all such constituents are deletable. This paper hypothesizes that there is a pecking order of deletion, which dictates that deletion should proceed from less important to more important information. Evidence is drawn from English, Russian and Japanese in support of this hypothesis. Interaction of this constraint with various syntactic rules in each individual language is examined, and it it hypothesized that unacceptability does not result when the above peeking order of deletion principle is violated due to the structural pressure of the language. Further discourse deletion data from Russian and Japanese are introduced, and principles that control them are formulated and justified.",0,1
"The article offers an historical overview of the forced exile produced by the so-called Retirada, a massive flux of Republican soldiers and civilians who escaped the fascist occupation of Franco's troops at the end of January 1939 after their victory over the Republican government in Catalonia. When the French government opened the border at the beginning of February, around 275,000 exiles were placed in internment camps, mostly along France's southeastern coast. This article seeks to provide a general overview of the relatively unknown exile of Spaniards on French soil, while underlying the enlistment of an important number of them in the French resistance movement, as well as giving new insights into the specific destiny of Catalans in the French camps.",0,1
"This paper provides a detailed description and analysis of the phonology of Panãra (ISO code: kre), a Northern Jê language spoken in central Brazil. Panãra exhibits a particularly large phonemic inventory, which contrasts oral and nasal segments, as well as short and long segments, in both its consonant and vowel inventories. Specifically, the language exhibits seventeen contrastive consonants, twenty-eight contrastive vowels, and a very complex phonological grammar at the segmental level, with a number of significant alternations. The prosodic phonology of Panãra will be presented in a separate article (Lapierre 2023).",0,1

"In recent years multilingual approaches to teaching have been widely discussed and translanguaging has been proposed as a pedagogy that offers very positive results in many contexts. Overall, the need to reverse monolingual assumptions among teachers and to adapt pedagogical translanguaging to each context has been highlighted. For that purpose, training preservice teachers on multilingualism, translanguaging and on how to transform their educational practises is fundamental. In the present study, we train 117 preservice teachers on translanguaging and materials’ design and analyse the created materials quantitatively and qualitatively. The outcomes reveal some common traces among the materials presented and these are analysed as related to infant and primary teachers’ professional development and to a broader educational context.",0,1
"Did medieval women who wore the crown share a common notion of queenship or recognize their own membership in a privileged group? Throughout medieval Europe the most salient images of queenship were those of wife, mother, and intercessor, familiar to the general population through Biblical and literary sources. This essay suggests that medieval Mediterranean queens were, in fact, aware of the power and influence that their role as intercessor afforded them. Two texts composed by the Aragonese queen Violant de Bar are used to shed light on a notion of queenship seemingly understood by her contemporaries, both male and female. The proemi or prologue of the queen’s address on judicial reform to the Catalano-Aragonese corts generals of 1388-1389 and a lengthy letter (1421) to queen María of Castile reference the responsibilities of the queen in mediating tensions and hostilities between the king and his rivals. From these documents, one gleans that queenship in early fifteenth-century Mediterranean Europe appears to have been viewed by its practitioners as a divinely-appointed office that entailed grave responsibility, as well as influence, by means of its emphasis on intercession.",0,1

"Previous studies report that children use color words haphazardly before acquiring conventional, adult-like meanings. The most common explanation for this is that children do not abstract color as a domain of linguistic meaning until several months after they begin producing color words, resulting in a stage during which they produce but do not comprehend color words. Contrary to this account, the current study provides converging evidence from multiple measures that toddlers often acquire partial but systematic color word meanings before production, although adult meanings are acquired much later. Also, we found that whereas children’s interpretation of color words is relatively conservative before the onset of color word production, their meanings become broader and overextended upon the onset of production. These data support the idea that inductive processes of category formation, rather than problems abstracting color, explain the delay between children’s first production of color words and mastery of adult meanings.",0,1
"In our research on using information extraction to help populate semantic web resources, we have encountered significant obstacles to interoperability between the technologies. We believe these obstacles to be endemic to the basic paradigms and not quirks of the specific implementations we have worked with. In particular, we identify five dimensions of interoperability that must be addressed to successfully employ information extraction systems to populate semantic web resources that are suitable for reasoning. We call the task of transforming IE data into knowledge-based resources knowledge integration and we report results of experiments in which the knowledge integration process uses the deeper semantics of OWL ontologies to improve by between 8% and 13% the precision of relation extraction from text.",0,1
